2025-03-31,[Mind The Game Podcast] LeBron James talks to Steve Nash about what excites him the most about playing with Luka Doncic,,"2006 Cavs teammates: üòê || Bron really not gonna retire till Luka stays in his prime lmao || Wow JJ really has aged a lot in the last few months, being the Lakers coach must be stressful || Seeing your second and third favorite players praise your favorite player is so weird lol. || Bron knows what's up, too bad Nico thinks he's too fat and an alcoholic || Love Steve Nash. Happy to see him on this show. ||  But Tim Hardaway said they dont like playing with Luka?! || 2006 cavs: why he say fuck me for? || ""If you have two guys on you..."" || Fuck the Mavs || Steve‚Äôs lazy eye had me distracted ngl lmao. || It was always my lowkey dream to see Luka and LeBron on the same squad. Obviously my expectation was Lebron would come to the mavs somehow. Bittersweet year but at least I get to watch them slay the nba together. Goat torch passing moment round 2 for Luka. First with Dirk and now with Bron. || This pod rules || ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt new heads play like Luke, are they stupid?‚Äù || Can see the pain in Nash‚Äôs eyes when the suspension is brought up. Still a horrible suspension to this day.

Nash‚Äôs Suns should‚Äôve been in the Finals vs that Cavs team in 2007. || This the next chapter of Lebron's prime. || do you guys think Steve Nash was the right pick? || i can‚Äôt believe they gave Luka to the Lakers lmao || Remember when r/nba guaranteed Nash would be an incredible coach and then years later guaranteed Redick would suck?

You could do so well just betting the opposite of the r/nba consensus || GOAT",2025-03-31
2025-03-27,"Stephen A. Smith on LeBron James: ""I suggest that he be happy with the things that I haven't brought up. I never brought up why you were not at Kobe Bryant's memorial service. I never really brought up or discussed why you did not attend Dwyane Wade's Hall of Fame induction""",,"Wow that‚Äôs really personal || If I'm not mistaken, LeBron was at Kobe's memorial, and I'm pretty sure Bronny's cardiac arrest occurred during Wade's HoF induction, which anyone can understand why he wouldn't be there. If I'm LeBron, I would be looking to torpedo SAS right now and kill his career with all this shit he is saying. The crazy part is Screaming A still doesn't understand this all started because he called LeBron a bad father because of Bronny's draft status as a 55th selection. || 2024 - Kendrick vs. Drake (Kanye left out)

2025 - LeBron vs. Stephen A (Skip left out) || This part is actually going to rub players the wrong way. 

Throwing Kobe and Bronnys heart condition into this is going to shift the way anyone interacts with him. || Bro is really using Kobes death as a talking point. He's fucking delusional. Hope this is the start of his downfall. || Stephen A thought he was untouchable because he goes on all the ex-NBA players podcasts and is now absolutely losing it because a player is going at him. Not only that, it's THEE player going at him.

He's fucking himself because he's bringing up personal stuff. It's going to kill his relationship with other players. What a great watch. || Yikes. What a horrible take. When your child almost dies, there‚Äôs probably a perspective shift on things that matter in life. Achievements are cool and fun, but you don‚Äôt die with them at your bedside. You die with your favorite memories of loved ones playing in your head. 

I don‚Äôt care how close he was with Wade. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs hall of fame, siblings birth of a child, wedding, etc. If my son almost dies at 19, I‚Äôm spending every second with him until I feel like he‚Äôs safe. 

Fuck Stephen A || D wade said at the time, LeBron was with his son for Pt recovery this is disgraceful and disgusting af from
SAS truly unhinged shit || Well Stephen A had 1 of two options. 

1.) Play it off and bow out of a back and forth with LeBron, continuing his job of commentating on basketball

2) Go full crash out and slander LeBron because you feel embarrassed 

Obviously Stephen A preferred option 2 || LeBron was at Kobe's memorial...LA times reported him as being there and there were reports following that said he requested that cameras do not pan to him.  For a guy who prides himself on being a ""journalist"" and having so many sources, you'd think he would know better than to stoop this low || Watching SAS ruin his career thinking he can win a beef against LeBron is kinda crazy || [deleted] || Wishful thinking but I hope this is the start of bringing down the popularity of SAS. He‚Äôs been a stain for a long time and it‚Äôs sad he has all this wealth for being a loudmouth idiot.  

He comes off really petty and distasteful here. I wish he swung on LeBron and got knocked out in defense. || It's so crazy that SAS thinks he can win this. His ego is so massive he thinks people like him and his opinions more than LeBron James. All LeBron would have to do to end this is tell ESPN that no one in Klutch will agree to talk to ESPN until SAS is gone and that's that. || This is getting weird || Calls LeBron a liar then proceeds to lie. Alright dude. || I‚Äôm pretty sure he did attend Kobe‚Äôs funeral, but even if he didn‚Äôt who cares? We gonna judge people for how they grieve? There would be no problem imo if he didn‚Äôt turn up. Such a fucked up thing to bring up || I can't wait for LeBron to call SAS a pedophile on live television. || Looks like Stephen A. woke up and decided that he wants to ruin his career. || Who gave SAS a platform",2025-03-27

If he takes up any kind of post-career media work, more and more people are going to realize how much his greatness expands beyond putting the ball in the hoop. We are so lucky to have this guy at the top of our sport for such a huge chunk of our lives. || LeBron is actually hilarious || To be fair to Riley though paying someone for the future on their past accomplishments and not what you think they‚Äôre worth in the future is exactly how you DONT WIN in the future || Cookies are for closers.


Seriously though, it's crazy that D Wade was never once the highest paid player on the Heat. Absolute penny pinching on Reily's part || LePocalypse continues. || This isn‚Äôt on the heat sub yet , just a bunch of fuck Jimmy posts lol. 

We have fallen so far as a franchise and the one responsible has a cult following. || He did it all for the cookie || He has incredible timing for jokes lmao || Think of how care free and casual LeBron already is getting with his answers, the doc and interviews he drops after he actually retires are gonna be an absolute goldmine",2025-03-26

Since I still check on it from time to time and even today when checking to inform the few people I still have on there about it there was no mention anywhere of it shutting down. 

Microsoft sucks ass! They got rid of MSN messenger back in the day to go to skype and I thought maybe it would be better since they could incorporate a bunch of the features MSN messenger had but nope, they did nothing with Skype and it was worse than MSN messenger.

Can we make it where when the offensive player jumps into a defender that it‚Äôs an offensive foul? || Okc fan here, can confirm || MLB is truly the model to follow here but judging by Silvers comments he thinks the game is fine.

Baseball was too slow: they introduced the pitch clock.

Analytics said stolen bases was ineffective: they made the bases larger to encourage stealing and make it more valuable.

Excessive shifts took away excitement from the game: they removed it.

NBA has made so many rule changes to benefit the offense but almost 0 in years to benefit the defense. I think you can keep the 3 pointer and add the ability for defenders to defend and then iterate and go from there. || The low post game is almost non existence and it makes me sad. || It's extremely easy to fix the rampant 3's. Just call moving screens and travels, which give insane advantages to perimeter players.

They're free to come off of screens at 100mph, fully knowing that they can take 3 steps after catching a pass to get to their spot, stabilize, choose whichever pivot they want as they set their feet up for a shot, while the refs swallow their whistles. I mean, for real, high school refs would be blowing out lung tissue in their eagerness to call something like [this](https://streamable.com/rdi1rl). NBA refs just let people do whatever, so plays like that one happen 50 times per game.

Call the game appropriately, let defenders count on the rulebook to work with them instead of against them, and that will inevitably lead to greater diversity of play, instead of a competition of who can build the better 5-out offense. || They optimized the fun out of the game || Doesn't help that the new generational stars have either out right dismissed it like Shai and Ant or give 0 shits in game like Jokic and Luka. Not singling them out as the only culprits but doesn't help. || Its not the 3 point shooting. Its the officiating. The biggest issue is the offensive players purposely creating contact to draw fouls, and then that not being called consistently unless you are a super star. 

And start calling moving screens and stop letting guys take one dribble past half court and get a layup. Its ridiculous. || Is this quote taken out of context or does this answer have nothing to do with the question?

I'm also pretty sick of seeing this take everywhere. Offensive players getting to get away with virtually anything making defense impossible is much more of a bigger issue with the game today || These players can‚Äôt shoot 3 without traveling, carrying and illegal screen.  Just look at how many players can make 3s without changing their pivot foot from catching non ideal pass. || The game is not in a good spot and no that‚Äôs not old head talk. Even less than 10 years ago you had variety in offenses. It‚Äôs not a fun product to watch || Analytics mathematized the game of basketball || They should reintroduce hand checking and actually enforce the rules against flopping. || I keep seeing fingers being pointed at the 3 pointer making the game less fun. I guess. I‚Äôll argue it‚Äôs the fuck‚Äôn foul line killing the game. They‚Äôre taking too many foul shots, and they‚Äôre spending too much time at the line while they‚Äôre up there. 

Stop calling touch fouls, *actually* regulate flopping out of the game, and stop allowing shooters to lean into defenders to initiate contact and draw the foul. At the line, ban high fives and handshakes in between shots. Add a god damn pitch clock, and enforce it. Not ten seconds to shoot each shot. You have 20(?) seconds to get both shots off. Shoot the ball and keep your feet planted because the ball is coming back at you. Giannis taking 90 seconds, or whatever, to get 2 foul shots off 8 times a game is unwatchable.

As for maybe regulating the three. Enforce moving screen violations. Maybe loosen the hand- checking rules at the perimeter. And again, not allowing the shooter to lean into a defender to initiate contact and draw a foul could help. || Let them handcheck and let defenders decide lay defense. Stop rewarding guys like embiid and SGA. Do some rule changes to stop flopping. No one wants to see 100 stoppages during a game. || Yall were hating on Shaq for saying this and calling him an out of touch oldhead. Seeing teams shoot 50 3s per game is bad for basketball, the product looks no different than your rec league at the local lifetime fitness || Steph, Klay, Dame, and even Harden really made the whole world think they could shoot the three || allow hand checking from 3pt line to 3pt line. call moving screens, offensive players jumping into the defense, carries, and travels || Fiba games are much better to watch than Nba games.¬† Maybe they should look into that",2024-12-19
