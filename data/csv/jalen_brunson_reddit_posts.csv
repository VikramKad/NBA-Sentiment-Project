*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/nba) if you have any questions or concerns.* || Knicks and Hawks always a fucking classic || Made that over Dyson Daniels. Just an incredible clutch shot. || Mavs had both Luka and Brunson..... || Why win games with a blowout when we can further the Jalen Brunson Clutch Player of the Year agenda? || These games just aren't very good for my mental health lmao || Daniels gives Brunson a lot of problems so I think this is a decent psychological boost if we see them in the spring . || Knicks/Hawks games can't not give you heart attacks. || Unreal how clutch he is || I remember we had that guy too. Obligated to say fuck nico. || Dyson Daniels is my fav player to watch on defense this must‚Äôve been what the oldheads saw with Gary Payton || Brunson always picks the toughest defenders to beat, what a monster. || We just had to make this game interesting. LOL || That Brunson Vs Daniels match up goes crazy || mavs could use a lead guard like that...üê¥üî´ || I never liked basketball anyway || Any one have the clip of Josh Hart laughing in Niang face? || most normal knicks-hawks game || So clutch || ‚ÄúIt's beautiful, I've looked at this for five hours now‚Äù",2025-02-12
2025-02-11,"In 2018, the Dallas Mavericks drafted Luka Doncic and Jalen Brunson.","Those two are now the faces of arguably the biggest franchises in the NBA, and all the Mavs have to show for are Max Christie and the MRI scans of AD's groin.","Siri show me ‚Äúfumbling the bag‚Äù¬† || The Mavs really drafted stars for the Knicks & Lakers lmao. Are they a farm team? || Mark Cuban didn't want to pay Jalen, one of his biggest misses as Mavs owner || > MRI scans of AD's groin.

lmao. that's why I stay around here. || Cuban fumbled thr brunson contract. He has his share of the blame over the years. Mavs are cooked lmao || The subreddit doesn't want to remember that they made fun of the Mavs for having Brunson as their 2nd best player. || Hey don't you dare forget that 2029 first round pick. Nico worked hard for that || Don‚Äôt forget they shipped off KP and a second round pick for Davis Bertans and Spencer Dinwiddie. KP whilst I‚Äôm not saying is perfect and has injuries was a key part of Celtics building this super team. || We in ATL drafted Luka! || Worst franchise in the league now. No wonder they shipped KP and let Brunson go. They lucked out on the rest. || Luka was drafted by the Atlanta hawks lmao || Dallas just wants to be forgotten. It‚Äôs sad to see them fumble the bag on such talent. Luka shoulda been a Mav for life! || This is why you shouldn't sell your franchise to fascists || They have a history of sending off future hall of Fame PG's. Nash, Kidd, Jalen and now Luka. Time is a flat circle. || I just hope people don't drag ADs name through the mud during this whole saga. It's not his fault he's being compared to Luka through this trade. || Wow. I forgot about Brunson tbh. || I still can't believe we drafted Ant the same year we drafted Jaden AND called Naz up from Iowa

That feels like a Maverics move, and fumbling away 2 quazi-generational talents feels more the wolves speed, ngl || MRI scans of a broken noodle üò≠ || Luka is inexcusable but Brunson was never gonna become the player he is with Luka, that was still a fumble but not a massive one || Promote those scouts.",2025-02-11
2025-01-10,"[RoommatesShow] Jalen Brunson suggests the NBA creates it own version of Hard Knocks to solve the ratings issue. Says Miami, Philly, PHNX, and LAL would be the most interesting teams to watch.",,"A lot of things would help ratings

Making games easier to view would be a big one. Having so many games in a season should actually be beneficial but because they're scattered over multiple different streaming services along with blackouts and local networks not even having games. It's hard as fuck to even just throw it on without first needing to find out where you can watch. || ‚ÄúHard Knocks: Staring Detroit Pistons Jaren Duren.‚Äù || I dont even watch football and I enjoy Hard Knocks. || Brunson really out there being the voice of the people lol || Doing everything except addressing the streaming issue || I‚Äôm actually shocked the league doesn‚Äôt have one at this point. || Sleeper pick is NOLA for nba hard knocks || Fact is I don't find a nba game on my digital TV tuner. My local team is on bally and that streaming service was the worst piece of shit I've ever used. Make it accessible. Easy fix. || that wont help because the main issue is that games are too difficult to stream || I thought Starting 5 was the version of Hard Knocks but it was meh || He's not wrong about the choice of teams.  However, post-Butler, Miami might be boring. || They had this with The Association. 

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy0mNMjmxPI-ef7XfC9YkGyZa0j8lOwc5&si=PeAwAW2v0UMgc3Ez || I would watch nba all day if it was just on some streaming services rather than blacked out league pass or cable. || Oh so the same teams the media gives all its coverage to anyway?

There's 26 other teams mate, each with millions of fans, and they get ignored every fucking year. 

You want to grow? Stop tapping the same tree. || NBA TV had The Association series with the Nuggets in 2012 and Nets in 2013 iirc || He‚Äôs right except those might be the least interesting teams imaginable. I don‚Äôt need to watch Bron/KD/Jimmy in the cryo chamber and being old people. We know them plenty || Anything but fixing the actual problems lol.

If the NBA really wanted to fix things, this sub would be a great place to start. ESPN clearly has reporters who frequent this sub. I‚Äôd be surprised if most organizations (and the league overall) don‚Äôt have at least a couple of guys who are on here from time to time.

I think they know what the fans want to see, but the changes we want are at odds with making the most profit.¬† || And it shall be called ‚Äúhard wood‚Äù || Hard Screens || Let me see if LeBron and AD really scissor or not.",2025-01-10
2024-12-11,"[Begley] Jalen Brunson asked about Trae Young standing over NYK logo at half court, blowing on/rolling dice and picking up money like he was on Vegas craps table at end of game: ‚ÄúWe should win the game if we don‚Äôt want him to do that.‚Äù",,"It‚Äôs the right answer. Always sucks to get clowned, we‚Äôve all been there as fans, but to the victor goes the spoils. Good on him for not taking the bait. || I remember Mike Wilbon bringing this up a few times in reference to baseball players that act all high and mighty about other teams celebrating. 


""You wanna talk about disrespect? Hanging an 88mph fastball over the middle of the plate to Jose Bautista, THAT'S disrespectful"" || Media: dammit he didn‚Äôt bite || Nah he should have push some legislation to make it a felony || You can tell Jalen's a good locker room leader. || He's right. || ‚ÄúVegas craps table‚Äù more like New York City corner üòÇ || See, that's the right answer. No salty excuses, no podcast backhandedness, just manning up and saying they need to win to keep Trae from his antics. || Hell yeah this is the correct answer || Gangster response || Finally, an athlete who actually says it. || Respect to Brun. No crying and bitching. If you don't want Ice ""Brrrrre"" Trey to hoe you on your home court, maybe win the game. || You mean New York isn't going to try and pass a law banning celebrating on the teams logo like Ohio State? || Hilarious that people actually take this logo shit personally. Celtics fans throwing a bitch fit over that Kyrie Irving shit with the leprechaun was peak comedy. Pathetic crybabies. || Respect || Who cares. We looked like pathetic losers tonight. I had championship aspirations for this team and we look like a first round exit. Mikal is not worth the 5 picks if his defense is mediocre. We need an injury prone center in Mitch in order to fix the defense. There are so many warning signs. Hopefully this loss wakes the team up. || Good answer || That's my captain || a real man‚Äôs answer || take notes Ohio State",2024-12-11

In this quote, Josh Hart is humorously recounting how Jalen Brunson expressed his desire to attack Gradey Dick, a player from the Raptors, during the second half of the game. The phrasing adds a playful tone to the post-game commentary.

OP fails the Turing test || Hart: Who got that Good D?

Brunson: I got that Good D! || It's tough to swallow the truth about Dick. Underrated player who can drop a load on offensive. || Knew it. || Vibes Immaculate || They might be the funniest NBA players ever. || Clyde said ‚Äúdick was coming wide open on the back door‚Äù || r/nbacirclejerk gonna have a field day with this one || By far the best media guy in the NBA || thank you mr. breast milk || They were banging down low the entire game, until Jalen yelled out, ‚Äúlet me take it to the hole!‚Äù‚Ä¶ which lead to a massive facial. || Oh, it was humorous? The text in this post sounds like AI || still can't beat ""they tried to go backdoor with dick, wiggins sniffed it out""",2024-12-09
