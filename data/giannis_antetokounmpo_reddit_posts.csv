2025-04-05,Giannis Antetokounmpo puts up another gaudy triple double in win over the Heat: 36-15-10,"https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/401705697

Giannis is absolutely carrying the Bucks without Dame","Point forward Giannis is back and I'm loving it || It‚Äôs crazy how much better he looks being the primary ball handler now vs 5 years ago || Giannis must be a son/grandson of Zeus cause the guy is borderline superhuman || He really could put up bogus stats while playing elite defense if we stole his point guard every season. Dammit Jrue and Dame thank you for the top 3 seed finishes but he'd have more mvps without yall and still be in the playoffs. || Greek man good || deserved statpad with the 1 assist he had a great game || Him || Bucks vs Knicks first round would be some cinema. I think Giannis could carry the Bucks past them even with no Lillard. Gonna be an insane carry job and can easily see it going 7 games || Most underrated player in the NBA || Anyone saying another player is a level above him is full of shit. Players close or even slightly above, sure you can make an argument. But Giannis is top shelf valuable. || Giannis understood that the only thing he has to do to get recognized again is get some triple doubles || I happen to really like that Giannis guy. 

KPJ, what a steal of an addition too. || definitely not worthy of mvp consideration though :P || He really is a great player || It's a shame his PR team is not good, because he's actually the best player in the world. || Near half court lob to Brook was nice || Giannis probably averaging a triple double if Dame was out for the season || If Giannis just really figures out the strategy of the game over the next few years, and the Bucks put people around him or he goes off to greener pastures, he could really go on an insane career run LeBron style. Being able to dominate thru the pass while being hyper athletic and not injury prone is reserved for a handful of gifted people and I think he's just as athletic as LeBron was/is to where he can retire in his early to mid 40s and perform deep in the playoffs for another decade and a half. || What‚Äôs a ‚Äúgaudy‚Äù triple double? || Giannis is too good to not be on a contending team every season",2025-04-05
2025-04-05,Giannis Antetokounmpo is the first player to have 70/30/30 over any 2-game span since Wilt almost 60 years ago,"Giannis Antetokounmpo last two games:

71 PTS
32 REB
30 AST

The first player to have 70/30/30 over any 2-game span since Wilt Chamberlain (1968). 

Giannis has had to playmake even more with Dame out. This season, Giannis averages 32/11/8 on 62/35/71 shooting splits (66.7% TS) in 13 games without Damian Lillard.

Source: StatMuse.com and @StatMamba on X","Dude has been absolutely locked in the last 5ish games. Monster performances. || What‚Äôs Gianni‚Äôs stats since LeBron said he would score 250pts in the 70s? üëÄ || He‚Äôs become so underrated because while he‚Äôs third in the mvp race, he‚Äôs clearly not in serious contention for it against SGA or Jokic.

He‚Äôs been so great for so long that everyone‚Äôs desensitised to it now and since he‚Äôs not firmly in the mvp debate, he gets too underappreciated by the nba community now. || Giannis ""I can also get triple doubles"" Antetokounmpo || Please basketball gods, let us have healthy playoff Giannis. It has been too long.

  
This man is still, a fucking problem. || Having a crappy supporting cast does wonders for the stat sheet. Imagine the full season numbers if he didn‚Äôt have Damian Lillard. || But he won't get past Rodman in the 90s... Smh || Read the beginning at first and thought Giannis had the GOAT game tonight || My beautiful goat || This is Giannis. By no means saying he truly ‚Äúcoasts.‚Äù But guy just is one of those few players that has what you‚Äôd call an extra gear. Not the only, but one of few. 

By no means are they favorites, but all that ‚Äútrade him, rebuild,‚Äù is straight nonsense. You got Giannis, and you‚Äôre in the playoffs every year A) you don‚Äôt trade a top-2 player that wants to be there, B) Trading him anytime soon is the worst thing Milwaukee could do, and is the exact opposite of the moves they just made to get under the 2nd apron. 

You see it in his passion. It‚Äôs the guys that have that have that little, ‚Äúextra,‚Äù when it‚Äôs time to show up. A healthy* Giannis is a force that elevates whoever is out in the court. 

Always my favorite time of the year, cause we start seeing him truly ‚Äúrise up.‚Äù || 107/38/41 over the last 3. That's 36/13/14. Just absurd. Dame might have been holding Giannis back || With great defense. || In case not having the actual game stats drives anyone else crazy: 35/17/20 and 36/15/10 || Giannis is closest we will ever see to Wilt reincarnated; minus being a bad dude and having sex with thousands of women, the Greek God just has sex with the same woman thousands of times || Giannis has quite possibly one of the worst supporting casts in the league, Middleton never returned to 2021 status, Brook is old, Dame has been out, Bobby‚Äôs suspended, Kuzma is Kuzma, Doc Rivers is Doc Rivers, Taurean Prince has simmered down and so has Gary Trent Jr. idk if he can carry this team without Dame in the postseason unless he can sustain a 35pt triple double, which I wouldn‚Äôt say is impossible remembering what he did against the Celtics in 2022, but I feel like this team might be worse. || 7 straight games of 30+. 8 straight games of 60.0% fg+. He‚Äôs insane || The fact that those stats still probably wouldn't get him MVP over Jokic or Shai shows how great historic the competition has been || Maybe he actually would score 250‚Ä¶ || I was so shocked by the stat line I didn‚Äôt read the entire title. I was so ready to comment what kind of Bedazzled ass game did Giannis just have? || It‚Äôs crazy as his usage rate goes up his stats start to look like Jokic‚Äôsü§î Maybe he should be MVP.",2025-04-05

Wtf is a doc rivers? || 23-10 run since this future coach Giannis || What doc rivers does to a man || and after this they go on a run || The play that Giannis draws up: Run.

Happy for KAT. Damn. || The Knicks got an All Star starter because the Wolves got spooked by their own success.¬† Such an unforgivably bad trade for a franchise that has struggled for most of its existence to put together competitive teams. || Who woulda thought the Knicks would have 2 all star starters one day || LAMELO ROBBED!!! STOP THE STEAL!!!! STAND BACK AND STAND BY HORNETS FANS!!! || Two all star starters. Leon Rose changed our broke ass lives!!! || Let‚Äôs go donovannn || Finally r/nba can stop crying about fans liking LaMelo || If you would've told me in the beginning of the year that KAT would be a starter in the East I wouldn't have believed you. Incredible season from him so far (and the Knicks in general imo) || Solid || [deleted] || I wonder if winning the fan vote for east guards will sway the NBA/coaches to put lamelo on the bench || Orange and blue skies !! || [deleted] || Selflessly gave up his franchise keys and became an All-Star starter, that‚Äôs gotta be an amazing feeling for KAT || KATs stats are wild.

May I suggest an Ivica Zubac, averaging 15.1/12.5/2.5 over 32 games on a team that was supposed to be shitty but is actually pretty good?

Garland should be pretty motivated seeing this list too. || Mobley being 10th for east forwards and Garland NOT BEING TOP 10 FOR EAST GUARDS is fucking insane to me. All star voting is so dead.

Nobody is capable of using a sample size other than 1 of 1 anymore and we are all dumber for it || Nuance is dead, you‚Äôre either the best or the worst || Giannis has a point. The media can be fickle. One day you're a hero, the next day you're a scapegoat. It's tough to deal with that kind of pressure. || NBA subreddits are the same || Man I love Giannis || That's a lot of r/nba redditors as well, picking 1 game samples to call players either the GOAT or worst bust ever || I agree with Giannis, but the irony is that most former/current players that host a podcast nowadays are almost even more hot take artists then every non SAS media member || I bought a pair of Giannis shoes recently. They are incredible. || The simple solution? Just go 82-0 || We can call it the media, but this sub isn't any better.

I haven't really been watching many Lakers games, but the flip flop between JJ Reddick being a great or terrible coach depending on how the last 3 games have gone is hilarious. || he‚Äôs right, that‚Äôs one of my biggest complaints regarding modern sports discourse || Giannis personality too good || He‚Äôs so big he looks weird sitting on a normal size couch || This dude is HILARIOUS. || It's not just media. The fans (especially this subreddit) are just as bad about this if not worse. || What he say fuck me for? || Giannis is so funny lol || Sounds like r/nba too || I mean lets be real, its not just the media thats like this.... || Giannis receives almost universal praise from media and fans, deservedly so.",2024-12-14

Slight edit he had 14 rebounds","1 assist short of a good game. I guess he was still OK. 

His midrange at the end was so good. || 4 blocks, and that last one was so insane! Sucks that the crowd didn‚Äôt react appropriately to that play. || So close to a triple double || Run and Dunk man also Pass and Shoot Midrange man || Giannis and Jokic are on another level lol || He‚Äôs getting better as he ages, which is terrifying || He's still a top 3 defender when he wants to be. Just not for 82 games. If he gets to play playoffs healthy again it will be Cinema. || The race between Jokic and Giannis this year is gonna be one of the closest ever I think. Will ultimately come down to which of the two‚Äôs teams has a better record I think. I can see the Nuggets getting the 6th seed and the Bucks climbing to 3rd seed and Giannis winning his third. || The freak was out in full force || MV3 || Seeing him hit that turnaround fadeaway made me understand how TWolves felt when Rudy did it last season || Yea this is the best player in basketball lol || Run and Dunk and Pass and Free Throw and Midrange and Steal and Block and Rebound man is a fraud. Not even a triple double smh || While I love shai and believe he can win MVP, I will never suggest he's higher than 3rd best player in the world. || so close to a triple double but the 5 stocks makes it up || How am I gonna blame Laker‚Äôs coaching if Ham is doing so much better without them? || When Giannis hits that MJ like jumper, its time to just call it a night || MVP || Elite on both ends best player in the league until proven otherwise || MVP",2024-12-14
2024-12-10,"Giannis Antetokounmpo in the win against the Magic: 37 PTS on 15/24FG, 7/12 FT, 4 blocks.","Giannis had 7 rebounds too (including the most important board of the game), but unfortunately committed 6 turnovers, including a couple of frustrating travel calls that should have been fouls against the Magic (one was a legitimate walk though). His midrange looked like money, including a little Dirk Nowitzki fadeaway in the third quarter. A little quiet in the 4th (Dame took over) but he put the Bucks in the driver's seat through the first 3 quarters and made two late free throws to help close out the Magic.  
  
[https://www.espn.com.au/nba/boxscore/\_/gameId/401734902](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/401734902)","I had no idea he got to 37 points. Felt like an off night for him watching.¬† || Another statement win. (And some more $ for the end of the bench players for making it to the next round). || When it‚Äôs all said and done I think history will remember Giannis much more fondly as a scorer than we do now. His bball reference page is impressive asf.

Inflated era yada yada but damn basically 8 seasons averaging 29.2 ppg and 4 straight seasons with 30+ ppg on elite efficiency is smth only the greatest scorers ever have done but you‚Äôll always hear him near the tail end of offensive player rankings near like Tatum and Steph, and below Luka and Embiid. Obv no one is on Jokic‚Äôs level but Giannis is on the next tier and might be leading it. || One of his most meh games of the season.



edit: Also, did he not at some point have 3 steals and 5 blocks?

How did he end up with 2 steals and 4 blocks, lol? || This game showed all of the good and bad of Giannis. Great defensive plays and efficient scoring mixed with terrible decision making and awful FT shooting. 

Still an MVP candidate || The numbers don‚Äôt tell how good he was. || He's gotten us so used to his crazy numbers that were taking him for granted... Dude has been amazing this year. MVP imo, especially now that they're winning || We should‚Äôve won by much more vs the injury ridden Magic but this speaks to the Magic depth and grit more than anything else. Embarassing to have it be so close but I guess that‚Äôs NBA cup. || Giannis is unreal || Gotta get Thanasis that tournament money || Best in league man 5 blocks was a force on the court every where || His midrange looked like money? I watched the game and only remember him making one mid range shot. || MVP || Wild that he walked away with one foul || Kind of a terrible game from Giannis imo. 

Decision making with the ball in his hands was bad today. Played well off ball though, Khris unlocks that part of his game when he‚Äôs on the court. || MVP || MVP || Jokic and Giannis are the only players in the discussion for Tier 1. It could legit be Jokic all alone, but I would personally but it as Jokic and Giannis. No other player could carry the rosters that they have this way || Should be 3 blocks that call on Anthony was legit one of the worst I‚Äôve ever seen in my life || MVG or MVP?",2024-12-10

Edit: The ‚Äústatement win‚Äù meme is on a Linsanity run so far. || 1. Have Giannis score 59 points

2. Win

3. Profit || Giannis said we ain‚Äôt losing today || That had no business feeling like a playoff game lol. What a game || Tough loss for sure, but I‚Äôve already had more fun watching us this year than all of last year combined. 

I don‚Äôt like sitting Holland after the missed free throws in regulation. He fucked up, but show you have some confidence in him and let him move on from it. 

He‚Äôs a rookie. It‚Äôs a learning opportunity. Draw up a play for him. Don‚Äôt put him on the bench and risk him having to stew over that for the next few days as his last game action. || Giannis hooping like this for Doc Rivers is like hiring a 5 Star Michelin Chef to work the fryers at McDonald‚Äôs || THIS IS HIS CITY || Was this an ugly win? Yes. Do I care? Heck no.

I don‚Äôt know what we did to Marcus Sasser, but that dude hates our guts. || GG Pistons. Since we aren‚Äôt contenders anymore, yall are our rivals now üëç || Historic carry job! || Just wanna put it out there that we back up (Giannis needed near 60 to beat the fucking Pistons in OT, I‚Äôm scared) || Giannis is incredible and willed it in OT. Been a while since he just took over a game so easily like that. 

Defense has been legit good without Dame

Truly an awful loss for the Pistons || > A. CONTACT SITUATIONS
> 
> 1. Incidental Contact
> 
> The mere fact that contact occurs does not necessarily constitute a foul. Contact which is incidental to an effort by a player to play an opponent, reach a loose ball, or perform normal defensive or offensive movements, should not be considered illegal. If, however, a player attempts to play an opponent from a position where he has no reasonable chance to perform without making contact with his opponent, the responsibility is on the player in this position.
> 
> The hand is considered ‚Äúpart of the ball‚Äù when it is in contact with the ball. Therefore, contact on that part of the hand by a defender while it is in contact with the ball is not illegal.

One of the worst calls I've ever seen, luckily bdl || That foul call at the end of regulation was horrendous, probably a good thing the game didn‚Äôt end with that. Holland looked absolutely petrified at the line. || Cade is him, unfortunately Giannis is HIM! || BALL DONT LIE || IF IT AINT A STATEMENT WIN! I DONT WANT IT!! || Biggest carry job this season || What a game. The refs almost ruined that shit.

  
Amazing performance by Giannis in OT. || That game was fkn lunacy",2024-11-13

Bucks are now 2-8,,"Bucks are fucking cooked if they can't win when Giannis gives them 43/13 on 62% shooting. || a statement try || He was excellent today, especially in the 1st half but holy shit did no one else show up offensively for the Bucks

Credit to the Celtics for completely turning the game around at the start of the 3rd || [removed] || despite the loss man || Imagine listening to doc rivers in the locker room after the game from Giannis POV || This man scored 43 points. Bucks scored 38 points in total the second half. || Get ready to learn Rockets || Let‚Äôs not forget Bucks play in the East. 

At some point they‚Äôll go on a 7 game winning streak because they‚Äôre just facing Bulls Hornets Hawks and other unserious teams. || This team reminds me of 2012 lakers || Sigh. The schedule gets easier from here on out HOPEFULLY that helps. I miss winning. || Dame is a rappin Kemba walker || Holiday outscoring Dame is poetry || He‚Äôs gone || I was expecting to have to out tank the Wizards/Pistons and Nets but apparently we have to out tank the Bucks and 76ers

Just as I expected || Man Giannis really needs help out there. Maybe they should go after someone like Holliday. Did more than their current PG today, anyway. || well at least they won a chip , since they gonna be bad for a minute || Very quickly becoming Giannis ‚ÄúDespite the Loss‚Äù Antetokounmpo.

2024-11-10,Giannis Antetokounmpo‚Äô reaction to Jaylen Brown calling him a child ,,"Jaylen: ‚ÄúGiannis is a child‚Äù

Giannis: You're god damn right || I can't wait to hear Jaylen Brown's reaction of Giannis' reaction. || Finals MVP on Finals MVP crime || This makes me nostalgic for Prime Harden and Giannis beef. This isn't as savory, tastes a little stale but it'll suffice. || I'm going to need more popcorn üçø || 99% sure Giannis is thinking of more childish things to do during this entire commentary || Has there ever been a rivalry between a championship contender and a team at the bottom of the conference?? üçø || Why are half the streamables plagued with such low volume now? || Honestly didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see the Giannis hate train arc return after him beating the run and dunk man allegations in 2022

That felt like if dirk won in 2007 instead of 2011 || I used to play like Giannis || I mean, you elbowed him the fucking head like 30 seconds before that. || [deleted] || The too slow thing was childish.   But the post move didn't look that egregious to me? Like it's clearly a flagrant by the book bc of the contact to neck/head.   But it wasnt Chris Paul nut shot, or Draymond stomping on someone levels of bad.   

Getting caught with an elbow , especially from a taller guy is par for the course for about every basketball player at any level ever. || Giannis is unintentionally funny üòÇüòÇ || My new favorite player. || if the sippy cup fits || What the fuck is the audio on this clip lol",2024-11-10
