2025-04-06,Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Ends His Streak: 0 FTA for the First Time Since December 2021,"SGA had 0 FTA attempted in a game for the first time in over 3 years, and the result was an OKC blow-out loss. They particularly struggled on the defensive end against LA, but also could not get any offense going. And the fact that SGA did not get to the line did not help their offense either. And another thing to note is that on Friday vs. HOU Rockets SGA also had only 2 FTA.

In the playoffs he will also most likely get a less friendly whistle as games will get more physical.

He really is their only efficient scorer. || Thunder already don't shoot many free throws but it's bad if he isn't getting to the line. || Can't help but also think that social media bullying him and calling him a ""free throw merchant"" affected him in not getting aggressive in trying to draw fouls. || This will quiet the complaints about Lakers opponents getting an unfavorable whistle. || Merchant still selling, refs not buying. || Hopefully this is a preview of his playoff whistle.

It‚Äôs pretty subjective and why it‚Äôs so debated all the time. || They fail to account that Giannis is playing with Doc and Ham as his coach and assistant coach. That should elevate him to #1 tbh || Tatum is a 6‚Äô10 point guard who guards the center. Haters in shambles || Tatum is about to make yet another 1st team and is fresh off a ring, primed to get another one. He belongs somewhere in the top 4, if anything Luka doesn‚Äôt || What‚Äôs wrong with this? I agree with his Tatum take. I need my PF to be a floor spacer and Tatum is the better playmaker and more versatile scorer

There‚Äôs more to the game than just raw box score and Tatums shooting creates opportunities that aren‚Äôt there for Giannis teammates because the floor is so spread || What's his beef with Giannis? || Bucks haven‚Äôt won a playoff series in 3 years and they probably won‚Äôt again this year || This is a fine list?

5th would be Giannis and honestly, after Jokic 1, you can just put any of them any order and it's fine || It was only a matter of time SGA became hated. 

Sincerely,

Joel Embiid Fan || Any argument for Tatum over Shai and Luka is also the same argument for Giannis. Giannis better be 5th at least. || The Shai bots are not gonna be happy || Facts, Jeff Teague knows what's up || Luka over SGA right now is absurd || paid by boston || I‚Äôd have Tatum at 1.

Only other player this century to do it is Embiid in 22-23. || Friendly reminder that this man was traded in a package for Paul George || Yup he is the closest thing we have to Michael Jordan.

Shai last 3 seasons: 31.4/5.2/6.0 with 2.8 stocks a game, 52.2/36.0/89.4 (63.4% TS, 110 TS+)

It makes me think, and it's usually been true, that if you adjusted the combination slightly (what about 40 30-point games?  or x number of 35 point games, etc) the narrative gets a lot weaker

So for context with just these two players he's being compared to:

|Consecutive seasons with‚Ä¶|SGA|Jordan|Wilt|

|25 40-point games|0|7|7|

2025-01-12,[Stein] This Summer Shai Gilgeous-Alexander will be eligible for a four-year supermax extension worth nearly $300 million that would set him up for the first $80 million salary in NBA history in 2030-31.,"Source: https://open.substack.com/pub/marcstein/p/sunday-best-all-the-latest-trade?r=nuq3a&utm_medium=ios

SGA, remember, is eligible for a four-year supermax extension this coming offseason worth nearly $300 million that would set him up for the first $80 million salary in NBA history in 2030-31. It will be Gilgeous-Alexander's call whether to grab that deal immediately or hold off on an extension until the summer of 2026 to make it a five-year deal.

""I can only speak for myself,"" Gilgeous-Alexander told reporters in Cleveland. ""I love Oklahoma City and I can't see a world where I'm not in Oklahoma City.""

More SGA: ""I‚Äôm comfortable where I am. I like where I am. I love the people in the organization, love the people around me, and those are the things that matter. I go to work every day with a smile on my face. Me personally ‚Ä¶ the market doesn't matter. The money doesn't matter to a certain extent. But as long as I enjoy what I'm doing at a very high level, I love the people that I'm around doing it.""","Klay Thompson‚Äôs ***total salary*** through the first 8 years of his career (aka the entirety of his career before his injuries), which included 3 championships, 5 All-Star appearances, 2 All-NBA Third teams, an All-Defensive Second team, and an All-Rookie First team - $78,671,930   

NBA salary inflation over the last decade has been WILD üò≠ || How much longer are the Thunder going to be able to pay all these dudes? || It's crazy the nba salary cap was 70 million in 2015-2016. Shai will be making 10 million more in a year. || Why can't this type of inflation occur in everyday jobs lol.

Edit - i understand why they make millions from the start, it was just a comment for the rate of growth when rest of the world is going in the crapper lol. || if OKC can have their canadian superstar it's only fair we get to draft an American superstar next summer. || Weird that salaries are still exploding, while all the headlines this year are how viewership is tanking. Doesn't seem sustainable.

Wasn't long ago at all that $20M per year was BIG money for the NBA || Wemby is really gonna be the first to crack $100 mill/ yr huh || Luka is also eligible for the same contract, FWIW.¬† || NBA players get paid a lot thanks to all the ads we have to watch on TV. || Why‚Äôd you capitalize summer üòÜ || NBA salary growth is at a point where I‚Äôm no longer ‚Äòhappy‚Äô for them anymore. The nba product is so fucking greedy now. These tv contracts. Spam ads. Soft reffing to protect players from any sort of physical play. The coddling. Watching a game in person is ridiculous. Why does it cost as much to watch a regular season game as it does to go watch Coldplay or Bruno mars. And half the time the regular season game isn‚Äôt taken as seriously. For the prices we‚Äôre paying we need to see like playoff level intensity and tension to have it be actually worth it || 80 million to play with balls, fuckn stupid || NBA inflation is crazy || Yet they can't find a way to let us stream all the games easily, or keep ticket prices in check, or lower stadium food costs.. || What‚Äôs OKCs contract situation like with their role players? Do they risk losing any of them soon? || We traded him and our future for Paul George


What the fuck || 80 million per year is INSANE. 

Like I know we used to these numbers but still. || I think it's time that we as a society have an honest conversation with ourselves as to how much money is pointlessly wasted into what is ultimately a set of games. Others are echoing a similar sentiment but the naysayers are missing the point: Let me be clear we are not blaming the players for these egregious salaries (and $80 million is absolutely egregious lol). We get that it's a result of the insane amount of revenue generated, and owners are making even more of a killing. But this begs the question, why? We have always spent a lot of time, interest, passion, emotions, etc into these sports because of the camaraderie and joy we would receive as fans. 

But in an era where the wealth disparities between the super rich and the average person is ever-widening, with your average American struggling to even own a house and even more can barely make their rent, when inflation is out of control, when homelessness is increasing, when healthcare costs are outrageous, when the overall cost and quality of living is becoming unsustainable, why are we then feeding into this madness? Before it was stated that ""religion is the opium of the masses"", but in modern times it feels that sports/entertainment has filled that role. || These contracts get worse and worse as viewership declines. This is really out of hand. || I think one of the problems the league has comes from the top end salaries.  Stars making 60-70 mil a year and then ticket costs being so high make it hard for a Dad to want to take a family to the game.  I wish they would cap the max at like 25% of the cap.  It would allow more guys on teams to make more and I think allow teams to out together more talent.",2025-01-12
