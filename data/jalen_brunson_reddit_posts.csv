"[Wojnarowski] In a largely unprecedented financial concession to give roster flexibility to a contender, New York Knicks star Jalen Brunson has agreed on a four-year, $156.5 million extension, his agent Sam Rose of CAA tells ESPN --- $113M less guaranteed than he‚Äôs eligible to receive in one year.",,"That is insane. || The best contract in the league has become once again the best contract in the league. || This gotta be the best contract in the league right? || Breaking - Rick Brunson gets a 20 million a year bonus. He plans to give it to his son as a Christmas gift every year || Nova dudes better buy this guy dinners for the next 4 years. Including Chipotle. || That‚Äôs insane, Brunson REALLY wants a ring || What the actual fuck.

Never seen a player take *that* much less than they'd get || King of New York || Replace the Statue of Liberty with a Jalen Brunson bust holy shit || Power of friendship is insane lmao || Build the statue || If he wins a championship he's going to be regarded alongside the highest regarded NY athletes of all time. || This guy is such a fucking legend || This is why we overpaid for Mikal. We make our stars happy and we get rewarded. || Man really just wants to play with his friends || Build him a fuckin statue right now.

King of the York!!! || Brunson will probably go down as one of the most beloved Knicks of all time haha || Nah this gotta be some Morey-Harden deal || Wow one of the few dudes who is genuinely all about winning || Guy is all in on winning",2024-07-12
"Jalen Brunson was looking for his ex teammate postgame but Julius Randle walked off the court , you could see JB mouth to the Knicks lady ‚Äúhe left?‚Äù ",,"Nah, he actually looks really sad tho üòî || Oh man that really hurts üò¢ || Honestly I was a bit surprised that neither Randle or Donte didnt seem to say hi to any of the knicks before the game. Like everyone on the T-wolves it felt like went to KAT to dap him up and say hi before the game while the ex knicks didn‚Äôt really seem to talk to any of their ex teammates at all. || Probably just unfortunate timing. However, Randle got traded and the guy they replaced him has been much better and beat him. 

I can see why he didn‚Äôt want to talk if it was intentional. || JB is always a real one || I've done a full 180 on Brunson. I like him very much. || KAT was looking too, he only got a hug from Gobert || I feel a bit bad for Randle. Knicks fans are happy he‚Äôs off the team for KAT, and Wolves fans aren‚Äôt happy they traded for him.

On top of that, in what initially looked like his revenge game he got overshadowed by KAT, and blown out. He also got booed by the fans at home.

None if that is Brunsons fault of course, but it‚Äôs not hard to see why Randle is salty. || I mean, Randle was the guy who essentially started the Knicks developing into a contender again, and they traded him away while trading for Brunson‚Äôs friend in the same offseason. I wouldn‚Äôt blame him for feeling some type of way. (Not that it‚Äôs Brunson‚Äôs fault or anything)

But also he may not have known Brunson was looking for him. || I think he just got his ass thoroughly whooped and wasn‚Äôt in a mood for pleasantries more than anything. Most of the Wolves other than Rudy walked off in frustration too. || Jalen seems like a really good dude. Great leader. || So glad this man is our captain || Some of yall are toxic as fuck. It's OK to have feelings. It's OK to express your feelings. You've never missed a friend? Damn lol || So many times JB fronted the media after one of Ju's ""off-nights"" where he so easily could've thrown him under the bus, instead he always went to bat for him and talked him up, or even tried to take the blame himself.

At some poit Randle needs to look in the mirror, hopefully before it's too late because there's no reason someone as talented as him should have such a shitty reputation. || [removed] || Well maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have beat us by 30 then GOD || Pretty sure he left after the first quarter. || Damn, that sucks. I know that feeling. || Wasn‚Äôt he sick? || ngl im crying in the club rn",2024-12-20
"[Begley] Jalen Brunson asked about Trae Young standing over NYK logo at half court, blowing on/rolling dice and picking up money like he was on Vegas craps table at end of game: ‚ÄúWe should win the game if we don‚Äôt want him to do that.‚Äù",,"It‚Äôs the right answer. Always sucks to get clowned, we‚Äôve all been there as fans, but to the victor goes the spoils. Good on him for not taking the bait. || I remember Mike Wilbon bringing this up a few times in reference to baseball players that act all high and mighty about other teams celebrating. 


""You wanna talk about disrespect? Hanging an 88mph fastball over the middle of the plate to Jose Bautista, THAT'S disrespectful"" || Media: dammit he didn‚Äôt bite || Nah he should have push some legislation to make it a felony || You can tell Jalen's a good locker room leader. || He's right. || ‚ÄúVegas craps table‚Äù more like New York City corner üòÇ || See, that's the right answer. No salty excuses, no podcast backhandedness, just manning up and saying they need to win to keep Trae from his antics. || Hell yeah this is the correct answer || Gangster response || Finally, an athlete who actually says it. || Respect to Brun. No crying and bitching. If you don't want Ice ""Brrrrre"" Trey to hoe you on your home court, maybe win the game. || You mean New York isn't going to try and pass a law banning celebrating on the teams logo like Ohio State? || Hilarious that people actually take this logo shit personally. Celtics fans throwing a bitch fit over that Kyrie Irving shit with the leprechaun was peak comedy. Pathetic crybabies. || Respect || Who cares. We looked like pathetic losers tonight. I had championship aspirations for this team and we look like a first round exit. Mikal is not worth the 5 picks if his defense is mediocre. We need an injury prone center in Mitch in order to fix the defense. There are so many warning signs. Hopefully this loss wakes the team up. || Good answer || That's my captain || a real man‚Äôs answer || take notes Ohio State",2024-12-11

In this quote, Josh Hart is humorously recounting how Jalen Brunson expressed his desire to attack Gradey Dick, a player from the Raptors, during the second half of the game. The phrasing adds a playful tone to the post-game commentary.

He's had more foul calls this series vs the Knicks then ALL OF THE NUGGETS AND LAKERS COMBINED in Game 3 when both teams got more foul calls than either of them had during any other game this series.

It should be a technical foul to deliberately engineer a foul call. That should be included in a flop. If you take unnatural or extraneous and atypical motion in order to create a foul against you, that should be a flop. || The Brunson Embiid thing is reaching hilarious whattaboutism levels. 

One guy is 6‚Äô0‚Äù 190lbs,  consistently guarded by 6‚Äô5‚Äù-6‚Äô7‚Äù wings and giving up 25-50lbs, drives and takes contact. Cant argue that he embellishes calls. The other guy is 7‚Äô0‚Äù 280lbs and topples over like he‚Äôs made of match sticks whenever someone gets near him. 

The two things are not equivalent. If Jalen Brunson is a FT merchant Embiid is the whole damn FT market || I genuinely want to know why ‚Äòmarginal contact‚Äô has stopped applying to embiid in the last 2 seasons it‚Äôs become egregious. || Embiid mocking Brunson for looking for a call is crazy. || For any objective fan interested in watching a game of passably objectively officiated basketball, knowing and expecting that refs will def mess up a few calls, watching Embiid fall, grab airborn players, hipcheck, knee, kick, fully extend and push off his way around the court, and somehow Not get ejected, and make his way to 50pts on 20FTA, that was a troll / jerk masterclass by him and the refs WWE Style.

"[Begley] Asked about the 2-minute report, Tom Thibodeau says he‚Äôs more concerned about ‚Äòthe 46-minute report.‚Äù Says that he knew refs couldn‚Äôt call fouls there because of the way they officiated Jalen Brunson during Game 2.",,"NBA should make a 48 minute report fully available to the public. Really deliver betters and fans a comprehensive amount of stats and information to evaluate the impact of the refs on a particular game. || Basketball is just really hard to officiate, there will be dozens of missed calls every single game until the NBA empowers the replay center to take a much bigger role in officiating. Just as an example, it's insane that we have to deal with incorrect out of bounds calls when someone in a replay center can correct it in literally 5 seconds. || Some teams have decided to foul like hell and call it defense. They know refs can‚Äôt/wont call all. 

Unfortunately players need to be aggressive on offense to counter this. || i think part of the reason the game is officiated inconsistently is the slippery slope of basically greenlighting carrying on every single dribble possession

the ballhandler gets so much mobility and freedom of movement being able to carry the ball, which forces the defender into a compromised position that requires more contact in order to defend effectively

because of this, the refs knowing that they're overlooking the carries maybe intentionally and/or subconciously allow more contact. then this sets a precedent within the game. but towards the end of the game they see that either the carries or the contact become too egregious to ignore. carry hard and blow past the defender but get hit with contact? tough shit make your shot. on the flipside, just beat the defender with skill/speed and get a 50/50 touch foul, here are your freethrows good sir.

IMO if they clamp down on carries (and travels, but they're fairly OK for those and they don't give as much advantage) the games will be reffed more consistently and fairly in a domino effect || I'm not a Thibs fan but 46 minute report is a bar || In the 4th quarter Batum was literally hugging Brunson while guarding him off ball.

There were also several other instances where Batum and Oubre were tugging on Brunson‚Äôs jersey with no fouls being called.

I just hope certain Sixers fans and NBA fans in general can come to realize that the two minute report does not accurately reflect with what the refs had been calling all game. That‚Äôs all. || Reality is games aren‚Äôt decided solely in the final 2 minutes. Magic outscored the Cavs from the 2nd quarter onwards in game 2 and still lost because of the first 12 minutes.

Intrestingely he has left Luka out, his argument being that the Mavs are fighting for 5th seed. Nothing to say about the fact that Mavs record is better than Knicks in a much tougher conference regardless.

(Context : this is right after Ja lost 1-4 to the jazz, the same jazz that lost in 6 games to the Kawhiless clippers and Luka and the mavs just took the kawhi clippers to 7 games.)

This year while talking to Ant about the best players in the league he didn't mention Luka, he tried to brush past Luka's name when Ant mentioned it, but props to Ant he again brought Luka's name up and SAS had to acknowledge it.

I guess that's how much it hurts SAS, Year after year  he picks one person, desperately hoping they are better than Luka, first it was Ayton, Trae,  Ja , Ant and now it's Shai and each year Luka comes out on top. || He was pretending Tatum was the favorite for a month or so up until just two weeks ago lol Now he's not even in his top five. || Not having Luka in the ballot should disqualify you for the next season one. || It would be funny until you realize he actually votes.

No one will benefit more from the KAT/Randle trade than Jalen Brunson,"Here is the [how far, on average, the other team's rim protector stood from the basket when each team attempted a shot last season](https://imgur.com/a/Wuhv7UQ)


As you can see the Celtics are by far #1, with an average distance of 11'4. And the Knicks are **dead last** at 7'8.


The Knicks are replacing complete non shooters like Mitchell Robinson/Isaiah Hartenstein for the best shooting center of all time. Jalen Brunson is about to feast in the paint. When Brunson was in Dallas he was statisitically one of the best guard finishers in the entire league (he shot 75% inside of 3 feet his final 2 seasons there). But his numbers have been down in New York, and I think with KAT being here he can get his efficiency back up.","Is anyone talking about the inherent benefit of having the ball handler and roller having opposite strong hands in the pnr? That way the ball handler and roller are both driving into their stronger finishing hand. So now Ant (right) and Randle (left) and Brunson (left) and Kat (right) all can pnr into strong hand strong hand. || Losing donte is a bigger deal than most are acknowledging. He wasn‚Äôt just a 40% 3 pt shooter on major volume, he was also 99th percentile in deep 3 point shotmaking. You needed to defend donte up to 30 ft out. That makes a big difference in spacing, even when compared to good 3 point shooters who can‚Äôt extend past the arc. It‚Äôs not a death sentence but all the same they need to find a better shooter than hart to play at the 2 || Idk i feel like both teams decided who their star was.

For the Knicks it‚Äôs Jalen and for the Wolves it‚Äôs Ant. Pressure is going to be on Ant this season, officially his team now. 
I just can‚Äôt believe the team built on friendship was built on liessss lmao || This is a we shall see trade || Honestly I‚Äôm surprised more ppl aren‚Äôt higher on this for the Knicks. Losing Randle for the regular season might suck but it‚Äôs not as if KAT is terrible for that either, and I frankly think KAT has been a better playoff performer despite the low bar. 

Donte is the main loss, but they have plenty of guys who can replicate his role. || Also this bodes well for Kolek as well || The other half of the coin is he is going to have to handle the ball literally all the time and is going to get ran to the ground in the playoffs  again || Minnesota was way too reliant on KAT‚Äôs success in the playoffs. They will be happy they made this trade, Donte will have a huge impact. More depth and having Ant as your clear guy is the move. This will expand his window a bit more 

NY lost a couple good guys but they brought in Bridges already and the best shooting big in the league. 

It‚Äôs a win for both but both fanbases will have to get over their heartbreak || losing randle is amazing for the knicks given he is way too ball dominate and historically seen pouting when things didn't go his way. then you hear donte having issues with not having a bigger role, it all makes sense for the knicks. better talent and culture? huge win. || Ehh, sure but unless Josh hart improves his 3 point percentage, good teams will always help off him. || I‚Äôve seen this chart thrones around many times but I think this highlights the identity strength of Knicks basketball (and Magic to a lesser extent)  or their weakness. I don‚Äôt know if more spacing helps Brunson‚Äôs game more than offensive board and screens from Hartenstein for Brunson is a master at creating a separation and finding an angle in a tight space and Hartenstein is one of league‚Äôs most protocol screener. Losing Donte, like you said,, who just had a career shooting season, is also a big factor. || It‚Äôs crazy. A few months ago this sub thought Randle was the worst player in the league. Now, we‚Äôre not too sure if KAT is any better than him. Strange || Tbh its more for Bridges . Now he will be 3rd option so he can focus on defense . Him, OG and Hart is nice throw against Brown and Tatum. Its like how Wolves was built to beat Nuggets. || Knicks starting lineup is probably top 2 in the league. But the bench is very thin now.

A lot of players avoid NY because of the media scrutiny and the fickle fans.

However, NYC is truly a place where a player can be almost deified if they perform like this. There's no other place in the country where fans will behave like this enmasse. Brunson is even getting VIP chants in opponents' stadiums from all the NY transplants, and the frequency and volume is increasing... || Jalen not answering the first question was him not trying to pull an Ant Edwards.

He's the most beloved Knick since Ewing. We love an underdog that just wants to be here and win. This team is so loved it's incredible. || Happy for this man. Happy for Knicks fans.

Then on the other end of the spectrum, you have Brunson driving hard to the cup all night and doesn't get any calls, which has been happening all season for him.

The NBA needs to shift the balance to reward defenders plus fix these terrible calls or you'll end up with games like tonight where referees are either extremely one-sided and inconsistent, or both.

[The Roommates Show] Jalen Brunson & Josh Hart discuss whether Rudy Gobert deserved the DPOY & the hate Rudy gets around the league,,"I know this comment will come off in a bad way because I'm a Bucks fan and it sounds like sour grapes when Bucks fans critique Jrue. But Jrue is my guy, all love to him, he's a terrific defender.

That said, it's kinda wild to say Rudy can't be dpoy because he gets ISOd and scored on in the playoffs. Then turn around and say Jrue should win it, when Jrue got torched by Brown and Tatum in 2022 and got lit up by Jimmy Butler in 2023. Hell even in his wonderful 2021 run, it wasn't like he was locking up/the main defender on Kevin Durant in the Nets series.

There is not a single player in the league who can lock up literally anyone 1v1 in the league for an entire playoff series. The game is too offensively focused for that. || Jrue is the ""best defensive player in the league"" despite what Jimmy did to him last year, but Gobert can't be because  he couldn't stop Luka in an end of the game iso || a 6'6 person can't put a 7'1 person in a headlock from behind? || Its fair to criticize Rudy for having bad/awful defensive moments and games. Whats dumb is that players/media turn a blind eye when it happens to someone else. Jimmy Butler averages like 35ppg on dumb good efficiency against Jrue and its like ""what is he suppossed to do"", AD gets hunted on a switch by Jamal Murray (who is way worse than Luka btw) to hit a game winner and no one says hes getting exposed defensively and that he cant win DPOY. Its just a lot of double standards.

Is Gobert flawless? Absolutely not, does he deserve criticism specially for his series against the Mavs? Of course he does. But if hes so bad, why is it that the Wolves had one of the best defenses since the 08 Celtics and were able to win 2 playoff rounds against 2 high power offenses. If it was so easy, why didnt KD or Booker or Murray kill Gobert in our series'. || The host has the most bandwagonny narrative driven talking points. Literally every single one. || Josh Hart clearly doesn't like Rudy. He called him an idiot and then clowned him for getting into a headlock. Also said he has no business being in the dpoty race ever again. All this while saying Rudy gets criticized too much so he doesn't seem like a hater. This is what he'll say publicly. I can't imagine what these guys say off the mic. || As a Rudy Gobert fan the trick is to not get on twitter, not get on Reddit, don‚Äôt watch nba media, and don‚Äôt discus ball with friends and it‚Äôs an easy life tbh. || ive never seen a player so generally not respected by other players as Gobert lol Hart calls him goofy and says he shouldnt be considered for DPOY anymoreüòÇ cant genuinely think of anyone that has come even remotely close || Jrue is starting to get overrated as a defender. He‚Äôs great but c‚Äômon Jimmy cooked him last year. Bam is more effective guarding 1-5 and anchoring an elite playoff defense. And Wemby about to make everyone obsolete. || Luka would have also put Dikembe Mutombo on skates, and Ben Wallace too.  

does that mean they shouldn't be 4x DPOYs?  Or is judging an elite interior defender on their ability to guard someone 30 feet from the basket maybe a little silly? || The host dude seems horrible all that stupid talk about exposed, ""Jaden Hardy calls iso on you blah blah"", the Wolves had the best defense in the reg season if Gobert was so exploitable then why not every team do it.

Jaden got cooked, Kyle got cooked, Ant got cooked, Luka gonna cook everyone.
NBA discourse has been so dumbed down only reactionary hot takes.
People clowning Gobert and AD for Luka and Murray hitting a shot on them is some next level bullshit. || 1v1 iso defense against guards just isn‚Äôt his defensive strong suit. that‚Äôd be like a guard winning dpoy and complaining that he doesn‚Äôt shut down big post players || I think its interesting how players and fans have radically different opinions about things like this. Neither are strictly wrong, but it does seem kinda weird that as... casual basketball watchers (lets be real most redditors are casual) that they're trying to make the argument that players are flat out wrong for feeling how they feel regarding things they have to do.

  
I think JB and Hart are right in that Rudy does get too much hate, and that its an impossible task to do things like guarding Luka/Kyrie for an entire series. 

  
However on the flip side the game of basketball has evolved to the point that I don't think DPOY should be JUST the best defensive big on the best defensive team. I think someone in that lane can and should win in future years, but it has to actually be the conversation of ""Is his impact in this aspect of defense enough to outweigh players that may not be as paint dominant, but can shut down entire possessions regardless of who gets switched on him"". || Kyrie and Luka, two of the most iso focused guys in the entire NBA, got hot and torched our defense. How many tough jumpers did they hit over McDaniels/Ant/NAW/Anderson? Just because he‚Äôs not a lockdown guard defender at 7 foot plus doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not the best rim protector in the league and the key to our defense. He did a good job contesting the Luka game winner as well, Luka just balled out this series no matter who was on him. || I've seen Jrue be absolutely torched by Luka on so many occasions. How can you say Rudy doesn't deserve DPOY b/c he got torched by an all time great point guard as a 7'1 big man while Jrue deserves it despite being torched in a similar fashion? || Might get alot of downvotes but I think Rudy is in a no  win situation but it‚Äôs not his fault. A lot of the problems rudy has in terms of ‚Äúswitching‚Äù you can say the same for majority of the 5s. I think alot of it stems from rudy being overpaid ( like I said before that‚Äôs not his fault). Rudy protects the paint, he does his job extremely well. Rudy deserves criticism for not adding anything to his offensive game in 10 years . People blaming Rudy is wack and repetitive because at this point we know what he is as a player.Timberwolves got outplayed and out coached this series.  Awards are watered down, they haven‚Äôt meant much to me sense drose got mvp over bron and then Marc got dpoty over him. || good takes but this host is ass lol. not sure hes even listening to what theyre saying || This is getting old. Players and Media hates Gobert for their own reasons so they will continue clowning him until he wins a ring or whatever. Every player can get torched 1v1. || Players hate Rudy Yogurt so asking them if he should win dpoy is pretty useless. Advanced stats love him so hell always get a shit ton of votes but players dont ""feel"" his impact when theyre playing him || I feel like the discussion around Rudy is just too absolute in both directions. 

He is a GENERATIONAL rim protector and that aspect of him as a player is heavily underrated at this point. He is a free ticket to a top 5 defense.

On the flip side of the token, EVERY. SINGLE. YEAR. He gets taken out to the perimeter in the playoffs and gets absolutely torched. You can argue it‚Äôs a scheme thing and his team shouldn‚Äôt be forcing him to switch in those situations, but if you are the ‚Äúdefender of a generation‚Äù in modern NBA basketball, you need to defend the perimeter at MINIMUM at a serviceable level.

I think when you combine this with the fact that he is on a max deal and is completely inept on offense (that turnaround on Jokic was the fakest shot in NBA history), you can understand the criticism of Rudy.",2024-06-01

Carmelo Anthony says he wouldn't have taken a pay cut like Jalen Brunson did,,"We know melo || Carmelo ""if you have cap space left to pay others, then you haven't paid me enough"" Anthony || No shit Melo, that‚Äôs why you never won anything in the NBA and no one wanted/needed you on their squad for the last ~5 years of your career || I mean we know, if memory serves me well enough he used Chicago and Houston as leverage in his negotiations on the Knicks in the summer of 13 or 14. Knicks never made the playoffs again after that with Melo || We know you care about a paycheck and putting up stats more than winning Melo

But also Brunson‚Äôs decision wasn‚Äôt all selfless. He guaranteed himself a big payday now and is gonna be up for a supermax in 3 years || We know. || I think melo represents everything you don‚Äôt want from your franchise player. Always seemed like he was more interested in his stats and being a celebrity than winning games. || And that‚Äôs why Brunson will be contending for a title and you didn‚Äôt Melo. || Yes we know, you also didn't care about winning until your career was basically over. Imagine if he bought into being a role player 4 seasons earlier || You mean to say the guy that forced a trade to the Knicks that gutted the team's depth just so he can sign thr max extention there wouldn't have taken a pay cut?  I'm shocked.

Brunson's contract wasn't exactly a pay cut either.  This is his max extension but he would've been eligible for more if he waited next year.  However this positions him for a supermax earlier at 31 years old rather than 34.  It's a win win deal for both sides. || And that's why you're you and never became anything more... literally halted the franchise's growth because he was worried about a new CBA coming and forced a trade instead of waiting until FA.  This MFer was all about the money. || Yeah that‚Äôs why you went to the knicks instead of Miami || No shit Melo. || We know brother || This guy is such a loser I remember in his knicks days he was crying about losing then said something along the lines of ""if I need to take a paycut to make this team better I will"" and Phil said ""bet I'll hold you to that"" he ended up taking the max anyways that summer || He literally destroyed half of the team he demanded to be traded to instead of waiting half a season more || ""I don't know the logic behind the reason""

The money ain't the #1 Priority. I'm not going to act like I know Jalen, but he seems to have his head on his shoulders and is prioritizing family and winning with his boys. I wasn't surprised to learn he married his HS sweetheart, the money and the fame seems secondary to him. He's already secured generational wealth. 

I loved the Melo Knicks era but let's not forget he actively hampered the team by pushing for a midseason trade instead of signing on as a FA. I don't think Melo really ever thought two steps ahead for us (albeit: the FO was dumb as hell) || lol no shit, everyone knows you can‚Äôt spell Melo without ‚Äúme‚Äù || 99% of the NBA past and present wouldn't have taken a pay cut like Brunson || Melo is allergic to winning basketball. one of the most talented players of this century too.",2024-07-25
"[Hoop Collective] Windhorst: ""I looked at stats today that monitored how high off the ground Jalen Brunson's elbow is when he shoots.

My mind is blown at some of the data collected || 2.5 inches is a massive difference in shooting form || This is insane data collection. I knew they were tracking tons of crazy stuff, but this is insane. 

I don't think we'll know the deal with his foot until the postseason. Says he's fine and he's not on the injury report, but it's clear he has no lift. That type of drop isn't just from being tired. || 2.5 inches is huge. My wife assures me of this fact at least twice per year. || We can get data on elbow height on jumpers within a day of a game being played but don‚Äôt have the technology, manpower, or camera angles to quickly find out if a shot is a goaltend or if a kicked ball actually goes off someone‚Äôs foot? || i am still curious how they collect this data.

and calculate the vertical difference... of a dude's elbow || He's been denying the foot has been a problem and Thibs backed him up on that.  I think it's just fatigue.  He hasn't just had to carry the Knicks in the playoffs, he's been doing it since **February**.  He's a great player but still a normal human with limits at some point. || They're trying to stop people from betting on him dropping 50 next game on ESPN Bet. Don't fall for it. || This is something Knicks fans have been pointing out the last couple games but some people really think the refs not blowing the whistle for Brunson is the reason why he went from dropping 40+ ppg in the playoffs to barely getting 18 points last game. He was averaging the most ppg in the playoffs if you remove free throws from the equation. 

He‚Äôs been playing hurt and can‚Äôt use his foot work to beat the defender to drive or get an open shot. It‚Äôs cringe as fuck to see when the team is already down multiple key players. You could make a starting lineup of all the Knicks which are injured/out; Half of Brunson, Bojan, OG, Randle, and Mitch. 

Our team has been a sinking ship since Randle got hurt but at this point it feels like they‚Äôre playing underwater hoping for the best. The bench also automatically suffers because the guys who are supposed to come off the bench (Hart, Deuce, Precious) are forced to be in the starting lineup. Hartenstein who‚Äôs also probably playing hurt is playing more minutes than he should because there is no Mitch Robinson to come off the bench for him. || this fuckin blows. Knicks have been by far the most exciting team to watch and it looks like they're slowly starting to shrivel from injuries and fatigue || This is probably more the foot than fatigue, but it‚Äôs also clear that Nesmith is better at guarding him than Nemby. || how do you even quantify this do they just monitor release angles? || Lol this the sort of thing that screws someone over the next game.


Id bet money brunson starts missing shots long now as he'll consciously try to correct his elbow || Yeah I think Luka has been working on shooting his 3s a little further cause he‚Äôs been bricking off the rim too. No elevation on his 3pt rn || I measured windhorst‚Äôs elbow while eating a turkey leg.  It is 1.3‚Äù higher during the playoffs. || All I'm gonna say is that playing guys 44-48 minutes a game might not have positive effects on their physical health || This is one of the things that Brunson would look at and go ""this is the stupidest thing I've ever read"" || Get the man some help || duh...he's hurt || I want the stats on Jaylen Brown's left hand dribbles.",2024-05-13

Both guys won 1 playoff series during these stretches (Melo actually only ever won 1 series in NY period). Has he surpassed Melo? If not, if Brunson has another good playoffs and wins another series, does he surpass Melo as the Knicks best player this century?","I think if he wins a playoff series then 100% || Jeremy Lin erasure || The funny part of this thread is people arguing whether the East was more trash then or now (yes). || [deleted] || I feel like everyone in this thread is 14. || Individually no, Carmelo is still a better player than brunson which says alot because brunson is a bonafide 30-7 a night.

The difference between them is the knicks learned from melo and were able to hire a competent front office and surround brunson with talent and a good coach so we can consistently get wins. || I don‚Äôt think so. Melo made 6 All Star teams with the Knicks alone - Brunson is up to 1 so far. He‚Äôll need more sustained success or a playoff run to get there. 

I‚Äôd also argue that Melo had a higher peak even if the stats don‚Äôt show it - he finished 3rd in MVP which Brunson won‚Äôt come close to. || not yet, but more accolades and a deep push in the playoffs as a knick could strengthen his case. he still has more left in his tank. eventually, he will surpass him. || Melo is notoriously hated in this sub, so you won't find great answers here.

But for my answer, Brunson hasn't been there long enough to surpass Melo yet. So the answer is no. || He got two good years || 6 all stars and a scoring title, so no, but it would be fair to say that he probably will. || This is wild. This thread is full of people blaming Melo for the Knicks' front office incompetence. I didn't even like Melo, but to say Brunson is better is crazy. The Knicks kept giving away all their useful players for aging, injured ex-stars, instead of surrounding him with useful role players. They had awful coaches and GMs, and no clue how to draft.¬†¬†


Now, if your question is, is Brunson's legacy with the Knicks better than Melo's, you have a discussion. Should we already consider him a better player? No. Not yet. He needs to do it¬† longer before we have that discussion. || Not yet, per pace numbers aren't a perfect measure, the league scores a lot more now per possession than the era prime Carmelo played in on the knicks. 


Melo was all nba from 2011 to 2014 (I believe), and I think 2013 Melo is clearly better than current Brunson, but I do believe Brunson will eventually surpass him as someone else mentioned how they've won the same amount of playoff series, and its only the 2nd year of Brunson's Knicks tenure. But yea, Melo is still my choice but it could be an argument as soon as this year. || Guys, you should erase Melo from your history, too.  It's fun. || I can't believe how unanimously everybody agrees that Brunson has surpassed Melo already. Melo had the damn scoring title and was considered one of the best in the league. Without me thinking of the list of players, I feel like Brunson is barely top 5 for back court players alone this season.

This is no hate to Brunson, he's a star. But no way has he surpassed Melo. Come on. || Brunson will never be as big of a celebrity that Melo was, but a ECF is really all it takes to surpass him as the Knicks player.

A lot of Knicks fans already relinquished holding Melo in any sort of high esteem. || My main takeaway from this thread is that Melo's last 4-5 years in the league must've really fucked up how he's perceived by younger fans. I was always lukewarm at best with Melo and I enjoy watching Jalen play much, much more, but it's still a clear 'no'. Melo is a 10-time all-star and legit a top 10-15 scorer of all time. Jalen has had two very good seasons. I'd say Jalen is one the best scorers in the NBA rn and probably the most underrated, but that's still just one great season.

If you're talking in terms of who's done more for the organization I think a trip to the ECF puts it in Jalen's favor, but if you're straight up comparing them as who's the better player it's not even almost close. || What's the urge to comparing the 2 instead of just appreciating how amazing brunson has been? || No || Too soon",2024-04-11
