The classic one is to pump fake, defender jumps to block the shot, then the shooter jumps into their body for the foul.  Or when the defender sticks their arm out towards the offensive player, then the shooter intentionally rips through their arms to get the foul call.  Harden was a master at foul baiting, but I think his flopping was somewhat mediocre.

No one will benefit more from the KAT/Randle trade than Jalen Brunson,"Here is the [how far, on average, the other team's rim protector stood from the basket when each team attempted a shot last season](https://imgur.com/a/Wuhv7UQ)


As you can see the Celtics are by far #1, with an average distance of 11'4. And the Knicks are **dead last** at 7'8.


The Knicks are replacing complete non shooters like Mitchell Robinson/Isaiah Hartenstein for the best shooting center of all time. Jalen Brunson is about to feast in the paint. When Brunson was in Dallas he was statisitically one of the best guard finishers in the entire league (he shot 75% inside of 3 feet his final 2 seasons there). But his numbers have been down in New York, and I think with KAT being here he can get his efficiency back up.","['Is anyone talking about the inherent benefit of having the ball handler and roller having opposite strong hands in the pnr? That way the ball handler and roller are both driving into their stronger finishing hand. So now Ant (right) and Randle (left) and Brunson (left) and Kat (right) all can pnr into strong hand strong hand.', 'Losing donte is a bigger deal than most are acknowledging. He wasn‚Äôt just a 40% 3 pt shooter on major volume, he was also 99th percentile in deep 3 point shotmaking. You needed to defend donte up to 30 ft out. That makes a big difference in spacing, even when compared to good 3 point shooters who can‚Äôt extend past the arc. It‚Äôs not a death sentence but all the same they need to find a better shooter than hart to play at the 2', 'Idk i feel like both teams decided who their star was.\n\nFor the Knicks it‚Äôs Jalen and for the Wolves it‚Äôs Ant. Pressure is going to be on Ant this season, officially his team now. \nI just can‚Äôt believe the team built on friendship was built on liessss lmao', 'This is a we shall see trade', 'Honestly I‚Äôm surprised more ppl aren‚Äôt higher on this for the Knicks. Losing Randle for the regular season might suck but it‚Äôs not as if KAT is terrible for that either, and I frankly think KAT has been a better playoff performer despite the low bar. \n\nDonte is the main loss, but they have plenty of guys who can replicate his role.', 'Also this bodes well for Kolek as well', 'The other half of the coin is he is going to have to handle the ball literally all the time and is going to get ran to the ground in the playoffs  again', 'Minnesota was way too reliant on KAT‚Äôs success in the playoffs.

I don‚Äôt know if more spacing helps Brunson‚Äôs game more than offensive board and screens from Hartenstein for Brunson is a master at creating a separation and finding an angle in a tight space and Hartenstein is one of league‚Äôs most protocol screener. Losing Donte, like you said,, who just had a career shooting season, is also a big factor.', 'It‚Äôs crazy. A few months ago this sub thought Randle was the worst player in the league. Now, we‚Äôre not too sure if KAT is any better than him. Strange', 'Tbh its more for Bridges . Now he will be 3rd option so he can focus on defense . Him, OG and Hart is nice throw against Brown and Tatum. Its like how Wolves was built to beat Nuggets.', 'Knicks starting lineup is probably top 2 in the league. But the bench is very thin now.

He always wants to audible and ad lib. \n\nHe was exposed when playing for Thibs as someone who was just far too much in his head and wanting to make up for mistakes and overcompensate.\n\nI wish you all the best, especially KAT.\n\nI think both teams improved, with the wolves in the long term getting off KAT's albatross of a contract. \n\nKnicks are all in or bust, so a lot more pressure for KAT and the knicks to perform, and he will be the first to blame because he is basically your only big at the moment."", ""KAT won't help with spacing as much as you think.

I mean y‚Äôall still gotta see us and I just think Gianni and Dame got something crazy in em this year. But I‚Äôd be so hype if I was a born and bred Knicks fan.

I‚Äôd be curious to see this chart from season before without Dame.\xa0', ""Can somewhat see the reasoning here.   But also, Brunson is going to likely see a whole lot of Kat penetrating the paint too.  KAT had made that such a massive part of his game over recent years it has seemed difficult to get him to back off the drives to rim.  As in the last two seasons with Gobert it would have been even greater times had KAT found a way to keep himself out on the perimeter more and just launch his 3s more often.  But at the first sign of a couple early misses in a row, he would turn it all against the rim.  Definitely if he missed 3 to 4.   Would hesitate to shoot even over shorter guards and instead would burn that one defending guard and attempt to drive in past two to three other defenders.  Offensive foul magnet moments.\n\nIn Minnesota,. all guards short of maybe Derrick Rose and lately Edwards were basically taken out of the point of attack roles.  Their roles were all shifted to be more like 2 guard and wings after peddling the ball early to KAT.  Even with Edwards at times KAT just had to back out of the offense in order to let Edwards shine more onball.  It was a bit of the old take your turn bit from multiple star talents.    So, I'm interested in how this pans this time with someone so clearly competitive, strong willed, and with massive game IQ like Brunson.   I have a feeling that a new team, new surroundings, will have KAT trying to fit in, not trying to take the lead so often.  If so, then I think the OP's points might stand.  If KAT doesn't let Brunson lead as much as he has, then it could go the other way at times."", 'KAT will benefit even more tbh.

This led him to rank #14 in the league in EPM and #2 in DEPM. Good defense also helps create easy baskets on the other end, and the same is true for his excellent offensive rebounding.   \nIf that's not enough, none of the Knicks' additions are strong passers, and Hartenstein would be the best passer on the roster. In fact, he assisted Brunson far more than Brunson assisted him, all while having the lowest usage rate on the team.   \n  \nThe Knicks were an iso-ball team that relied heavily on a high volume of bad shots and offensive rebounds.
