I laughed my ass off after that last one over the double team. ||  That was the most disgusting heat check I’ve ever seen || That sky fucker did it again || I actually can’t believe I watched that live || Is this what being a warriors fan is like || That last one was a war crime || Curry hit them French with his signature night night || I literally screamed at the last three against the double  || Steph broke the Reddit server || Beyond legendary || Outscored France 12-8 by himself over the final 2:48

ABSOLUTE GOD || He would get 400 electoral votes if he ran right now || That was fucking ridiculous. Even for Steph that was fucking ridiculous. || I was wondering why he didn’t do his celebration after the third one, turns out he had a plan || Goddamn I'm gonna miss this man so much when he retires || Nah that 3 he pulled with 36 seconds left and 2 defenders in his face with Kevin fucking Durant and Lebron fucking James wide open next to him is just obscene || Best shooter of all time || steph curry and making 3s that have absolutely no business of going in

name a better duo || Can you even imagine feeling like that in that moment",2024-08-10
I love Stephen Curry,"I love Stephen Curry. Any slander I’ve ever had for him or his team, I was wrong. Any comments I’ve ever made about him being washed, I was wrong. Any doubt I’ve ever had on him during this game whenever he gave a turnover, I was wrong. I love curry. He is my GOAT","Is this how GSW fans felt all those years?

I love having Curry on the team I'm rooting for lmao bro is a cheat code || 4 3s in like that short amount of time is crazy. The last 3 was a crazy crazy shot. I thought he was being a bit selfish on that last 3 but it still went in. Absolutely crazy || The fact we got to see Steph do the “nighty night” in the gold medal game was everything || It was like watching 2016 Steph all over again. || That last 3… wtf || Literally styling on them kids, illegal to field him at this rate holy moly || Like what the fuck was that last shot 💀💀 || dude i used to hate Steph Curry, NOW i get it! || France hasn’t been bombarded like that since the 1940s || [deleted] || Im done hating on him. He’s cooked my team for too long but I can’t hate on his game. Beautiful monster keep cooking || Get in line || He’s the most demoralizing player I’ve ever witnessed.  When he gets hot you can see the other teams body language change.  Incredible last two games for Chef. || Warriors fans knew he was hitting that shit as soon as he got the ball back and hit the crossover. Double teamed and didn't give a single fuck || skyfucker was in the building today || The man should get a second gold for the shooting based off of that || Probably saved us last game too vs serbia || THE BEST PG EVER IN BASKETBALL HISTORY || G O D || He’s killed the Rockets time and time again in the playoffs, but watching him bomb those 3s down the stretch (especially that last one over the double team) was SO satisfying. Truly one of one, we’ll never see someone like him again",2024-08-10

Most people don't realize that Curry is one of their best players. || Fake news, I saw an edit of him in a Lakers jersey just yesterday || Wait, this isn’t a trade for the Lakers’ two first round picks and Austin Reaves wtf || they have been for a while but these numbers are getting insane || So much fucking money and its still prolly an underpay lmao || My glorious king is going to retire a warrior || I remember when LeBron signed a deal for just over $20M/year and I was blown away by it. 

Now we’re in the $62M range. 

By 2035, there will be at least 20 NBA stars on track to be billionaires between NBA salary and endorsements. || I wonder how much this dude is gonna get in endorsements. Probably the same amount. || Franchise GOAT. Well deserved. || [deleted] || Underpaid || warriors FO saw the bleacher report trade too || Roughly 763k per game if he plays 82 games


1.2 million a week

I cant fanthom nba contracts anymore || Delusional Lakers fans in shambles",2024-08-29

>""Lookin like a 10 year old out there n shit"" || Warriors fans have been so spoiled with this guy lmao || Like this man or not, when the clock is winding down at the end of a quarter you can always expect Curry to try to pull some showmanship out of his pocket. This is what the NBA needs more of, not players deliberately holding until the buzzer to shoot their hail maries because they're afraid to hurt their FG%. || what the fuck || in-game horse shot goat || I love that KD dapped him || Suns needed a few more defenders there || Look at Curry man || It's gonna be a weird NBA without Steph. || I get why warriors fans say he’s the goat. I’m not agreeing but, if we got a dude that got us 4 championships. He’s better than mj. || Steph is insane going to miss him when he retires || When people bitch about the NBA promoting Steph and Lebron instead of the younger stars this is why || Bro really just throwing shit up like “yea the rims up there somewhere” || Dear lord that’s disgusting || He's a wizard || Why not simply run that play every time",2024-12-28

Steph holy fuck || That last one was just insane. I said no way he gets a 4th one like that.

"Barack Obama's Starting 5: Stephen Curry, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Hakeem Olajuwon","Barack Obama, executive producer of the new Netflix series Starting 5, starring Jimmy Butler and Domantas Sabonis, was asked to name his Starting 5. 

[https://x.com/BarackObama/status/1845503860296778159](https://x.com/BarackObama/status/1845503860296778159)

Barack Obama's squad is:

**PG -** Stephen Curry  
**SG -** Michael Jordan  
**SF -** LeBron James  
**PF -** Kevin Durant  
**C -**   Hakeem Olajuwon

This is a very strong starting 5 and it's hard to argue with what he did with the 1-4 spots, as Curry/Kevin Durant are just the perfect superstars to fit around more ball dominant players, while being creative with the ball themselves.

The only potentially controversial spot on the team is the center position. Obama may have underrated the value he could get by going small ball with a power forward like Tim Duncan at the center spot, the pure dominance of prime Shaq, or using Nikola Jokic as an offensive facilitator and three point threat himself. ","Better question:

If Obama were to name a starting five of US Presidents which would he pick?

Lincoln at center || For this team I'd rather have Hakeem over Shaq || Shaq is for sure voting for Trump now. || >Obama may have underrated the value he could get by going small ball with a power forward like Tim Duncan at the center spot

Tim Duncan already played center for most of his career. A 7 foot player at center is NOT small ball. || Obama knows ball || lol thats my exact 5. Hakeem over Shaq/Kareem may be controversial but its not like they need more scoring. best defender of all time next to Miami Bron and Goat MJ is 2-way excellence. || Hakeem is the right choice. I'd take prime Hakeem over all the dudes you mentioned. He was a very versatile center and could play modern positionless ball as well as anyone. || What starting 5 all time beats this one? || People listing their five and not having bron is bonkers.  || I love any starting 5 that doesn't force Kobe onto the SF position in order to get Kobe/Jordan on the same team. || Trump’s starting 5: Stockton, Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, Karl Malone, Bill Laimbeer  || Obama knows ball || Hakeem is a fine choice. Forget about his offense his defense is legendary || Arguably the perfect 5. It's wild that among that group, KD and Steph actually played together.   || >starring Jimmy Butler and Domantas Sabonis

I don't know why but that gave me a chuckle. || Shaq fell to his knees at a Papa John's when he read this || Accolades aside, Hakeem can give it to anyone and is probably the best alongside Bill Russell as the greatest defenders of their positions. || Wait a minute…. He cooked here. I’d go Bird over KD for the rebounding and all around game but the stretch 4 with Hakeem and then Steph MJ Bron is my go to build. || Ball knower || Alright Barry. I see you",2024-10-13

"[Poole] Even after four NBA championships, Stephen Curry yearns for a fifth ring. “Honestly, it’s the only thing I’m really playing for at this point.

He really wants to break the 3 pointers made record even further? || riveting journalism || Often I sit.. and yearn. || Trade yourself to Denver and play off Jokic. It will work. || seeing Curry get a 5th ring by himself would be fucking crazy. || Professional athlete wants to win championships, more at 11. || Winning another without Durant cemented him into the next tier. I’m not sure winning a 5th is an equal jump, but would likely put him securely above Kobe and Shaq, which would be pretty cool. 

Honestly, him winning a 5th will mostly just sting Klay, in a perverse way. || He gotta tell the front office this tbh. Because we still got no true big and 2nd scoring option and it’s been like 3 years now || Imagine Steph retiring with more rings than LeBron.


Edit: and in less Finals appearances too lmao || [nba player] to wants to [win accolade] fuck me a room full of monkeys with type writers could come up with this || Makes sense lol || NBA stakes need to be higher. The team that wins the championship should be able to take the salaries of the worst team. || If he not playing for money then take the league minimum and sign a superstar. || If Curry wins that 5th chip we better see him in those top 10 talks. Tired of ppl placing him in 11th and 12th 🤦‍♂️ || A KINGDOM FOR A HORSE!!! || Fuck off man save some for everybody else || oh Jordan Poole interviewed him || 4 aint enough?

"[Charania] Olympic Last Dance together: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant lead USA to Gold – completing commitment they made to each other, Team USA and the country exactly one year ago.",,"it's crazy how dominant all three look on a team full of all-nba players || This entire tournament was such a beautiful ode to the LeBron/Curry/Durant era. A perfect swan song || You know Kerr got serious when they started spamming KD/Curry pick and rolls. || It must be demoralising to play so well on defence just for Curry to throw it in the air and score multiple consecutive threes || Lost in Steph masterclass, AD unbelievable defense changed the game. This was a fucking spiritual experience to watch. || They're all still so fucking good.

Which makes it all the more depressing that they're all gonna be contending for the play in next year. || I pray that they had a documentary crew this whole Olympics. Need my kids to grow up on a documentary of Bron, Curry, and Kd last dance || The avengers avenged us || This was this eras Bird, Magic & Jordan || The documentary gonna be crazy || Send the entire footage of this olympic run to the HOF || The one and only Big Three

Retired the moniker like Obama retired the thanks Obama meme. || that's all folks 🥲 || Can we field these guys competitive NBA teams.. good lord they still have it let's see it in the playoffs || Ayesha please go crazy tonight || This is above the Redeem Team, for me.  Seeing these three play together was magical and, finally, being on the right side of Curry's magic is something I will never forget.  I really hope this invigorates love for the Olympics with the NBA for a long time. || It really felt like a movie, no scene cuts needed.  From Sudan, to Lebron, to Curry struggles, to Durant 8 for 8 to Curry saving the day.  Greatest team ever, best Olympics I've watched! || Put the Eiffel Tower in front of Curry, and he will still find a way to get the ball in. || Is it wild to anyone else that LeBron’s lasted long enough to feel naturally in the Steph/durant generation?

"[Wojnarowski] ESPN Story with @RamonaShelburne: Over a 24-hour window prior to trade deadline that included owner to owner conversations, the Warriors made an unsuccessful bid to convince the Lakers and LeBron James to consider a trade to pair him with Stephen Curry.",,"This is one of the most “you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take” things ever in the NBA || This sub would have gone into defcon 1 || Gotta shoot your shot 🤷🏻 || Draymond when he's teamed up with both is gonna be beyond insufferable lol || Also sixers called

Dunleavy Jr. was the second team executive call to Pelinka on a possible James trade, sources said. After seeing James' murky social media post of an hour-glass a week before the trade deadline, Philadelphia 76ers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey called Pelinka to probe on a James trade and was immediately told that James wasn't available. In fact, Pelinka responded by asking Morey if Joel Embiid was available, sources said || look i hate this as much as everyone but i would also have loved this so much. || The fucking Warriors really tried to do it again lmaooo  || That “LeBron trade request” and Rich Paul clarification didn’t come out of nowhere lol || This is like me shooting my shot with Sydney Sweeney for a Valentines date tonight || Born going to the warriors this offseason. We can’t stop it || The Warriors were eager to present a deal package to LA, but neither the Lakers nor James were ultimately willing to explore a potential blockbuster. Even at 39 years old, James is still playing at an All-NBA level that stirred the Warriors imagination about his ability to extend the window of the franchise's fading dynasty.

the Lakers ever wanted a temperature check on James' commitment, here was his chance to tell them. In the end, that answer for the Warriors and Lakers returned resoundingly on the eve of the trade deadline: Rich Paul told Lacob and Warriors GM Mike Dunleavy Jr., that James had no interest in a trade and wanted to remain a Laker, sources said. When Dunleavy Jr., reached out to Lakers GM Rob Pelinka in those pre-trade deadline hours, Dunleavy Jr., had been told the same: the Lakers wanted to keep James, sources said. || Draymond is beside himself. Driving around downtown San Francisco begging (thru text) || Extremely unsurprising that they called, that the talks were not *just* (although mostly) perfunctory, and that they got rebuffed.

LeBron at his age and stature might be the hardest player to value in the league: no one playing is more proven in the playoffs and he might win you the title year one. He also might pull a hammy and retire over the summer! 

Feel like at this point unless you're a legit cusp team any young players with true star upside aren't worth moving for him, which seems insane. || The meltdown that would have ensued on here if this happened.. || Lebron in a warriors jersey would break my feeble bronsexual mind || nah lmao geriatric steph and lebron would cook like fuck if the warriors somehow pulled it off || Numbers not enough, they should've tried to include FO members + janitorial staff to raise their chances. || The funniest timeline is these two becoming teammates || Lebron and Steph is a combo I’ve always wanted to see.

"[Slater] It’s been a layered 5-yr path to this divorce finalizing in the last couple weeks, where among conversations Klay had, league sources said — was a request of Stephen Curry not to exert his significant organizational influence & up the temperature with management to ensure Thompson’s return","[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5605834/2024/07/02/klay-thompson-warriors-split/)

&nbsp;

> It’s been a layered five-year path to this divorce, splintering last season, sprouting earlier and finalizing in the last couple weeks, where —among the conversations Thompson had, league sources said — was a request of Stephen Curry not to exert his significant organizational influence and up the temperature with management to ensure Thompson’s return. Curry’s measured voice, even if it altered the outcome, wouldn’t change the genuineness of Joe Lacob and the front office’s true desire to have Thompson back.

&nbsp;

> Controlling owner Joe Lacob led a front-office effort to take a cold, mostly uncommunicative approach to Thompson’s next contract in his three summers of extension eligibility, team sources said, which isn’t separate from their norm. Lacob has done similar in the past with Curry, Kerr, Bob Myers, Andre Iguodala and Green, using dwindling time as a weapon but ultimately paying up (he put a substantial offer on the table for Myers) after a staring contest.

> Thompson operates on his own wavelength. The Warriors’ decision-makers were warned that a drawn-out negotiation into July during this free-agent cycle wouldn’t be met the same way. He wasn’t trying to leverage his way back until the bitter end. 

&nbsp;

> But his decision, as one source put it, became easy when the Warriors kicked him down the summer pecking order.

> There was little communication between Thompson, the Warriors and Thompson’s agent, Greg Lawrence, and ultimately no offer in this cycle. Warriors sources maintained a plan to eventually make a competitive offer in relation to his market once other business was settled. But they never had the chance. Many league sources said Thompson’s decision to depart was unofficially made weeks ago.","love that Perk yesterday was scorching Steph for not using his power on the Klay situation when apparently he was specifically asked by Klay not to do that.

What the hell does the title even mean?

What is he even trying to say? || I think its perfectly defensible that the warriors were trying to make a big move to add a true #2 guy, and that they'd come back to Klay after they figured out what was viable. || Although klay played really well during his stretch on the bench, it was pretty evident he did not want to come off the bench.

Still sad to see him go, incredible to watch when he’s on || I remember when journalists could write a proper sentence. || This article was painful to read through and understand || Seems like the Warriors essentially had two paths (the ""flexibility"" that dumping Poole for CP3 granted them):

1. Trade CP3. That would mean they'd be over the tax line, so re-signing Klay wouldn't cost them anything but money.

2. Waive CP3. That puts them below the tax line, and re-signing Klay would hinder their ability to add other players (for example, using the NTMLE).

The Warriors were waiting to see how that unfolded before approaching Klay, and Klay (reasonably) didn't like that he was more of an afterthought than a priority. || It's always so overdramatic. It's always the same:

Player want keep playing for same amount or more money. Team no want that || It was a layered five-year path to read that headline too. || This is horribly written || Honestly,

Kinda curious as to why Mitchell has been left off so many top 10 current player lists.

Also surprised Shai is so low, but I'm biased, so ignore that. || The Nuggets looking like absolute ass while Jokic is on paternity leave was enough to keep him at the top lol || I actually hope Tatum elevates and wins it.
