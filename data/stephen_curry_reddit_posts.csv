"Barack Obama's Starting 5: Stephen Curry, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Hakeem Olajuwon","Barack Obama, executive producer of the new Netflix series Starting 5, starring Jimmy Butler and Domantas Sabonis, was asked to name his Starting 5.

Barack Obama's squad is:

**PG -** Stephen Curry  
**SG -** Michael Jordan  
**SF -** LeBron James  
**PF -** Kevin Durant  
**C -**   Hakeem Olajuwon

This is a very strong starting 5 and it's hard to argue with what he did with the 1-4 spots, as Curry/Kevin Durant are just the perfect superstars to fit around more ball dominant players, while being creative with the ball themselves.

The only potentially controversial spot on the team is the center position.

&nbsp;

> It‚Äôs been a layered five-year path to this divorce, splintering last season, sprouting earlier and finalizing in the last couple weeks, where ‚Äîamong the conversations Thompson had, league sources said ‚Äî was a request of Stephen Curry not to exert his significant organizational influence and up the temperature with management to ensure Thompson‚Äôs return. Curry‚Äôs measured voice, even if it altered the outcome, wouldn‚Äôt change the genuineness of Joe Lacob and the front office‚Äôs true desire to have Thompson back.

&nbsp;

> Controlling owner Joe Lacob led a front-office effort to take a cold, mostly uncommunicative approach to Thompson‚Äôs next contract in his three summers of extension eligibility, team sources said, which isn‚Äôt separate from their norm. Lacob has done similar in the past with Curry, Kerr, Bob Myers, Andre Iguodala and Green, using dwindling time as a weapon but ultimately paying up (he put a substantial offer on the table for Myers) after a staring contest.

> Thompson operates on his own wavelength. The Warriors‚Äô decision-makers were warned that a drawn-out negotiation into July during this free-agent cycle wouldn‚Äôt be met the same way. He wasn‚Äôt trying to leverage his way back until the bitter end. 

&nbsp;

> But his decision, as one source put it, became easy when the Warriors kicked him down the summer pecking order.

> There was little communication between Thompson, the Warriors and Thompson‚Äôs agent, Greg Lawrence, and ultimately no offer in this cycle. Warriors sources maintained a plan to eventually make a competitive offer in relation to his market once other business was settled. But they never had the chance. Many league sources said Thompson‚Äôs decision to depart was unofficially made weeks ago.","['love that Perk yesterday was scorching Steph for not using his power on the Klay situation when apparently he was specifically asked by Klay not to do that.  It makes sense.  Klay wanted the Warriors to prove they wanted him for him, not because Steph told them to.', 'Slater is a wonderful reporter, but he needs an editor lmao.

I know it‚Äôs tough to deal with two major injuries back to back but dude has taken no accountability for his play/literally losing them regular season and playoff games. Still sad to see him go, incredible to watch when he‚Äôs on', 'I remember when journalists could write a proper sentence.', 'This article was painful to read through and understand', 'Seems like the Warriors essentially had two paths (the ""flexibility"" that dumping Poole for CP3 granted them):\n\n1. Trade CP3. That would mean they\'d be over the tax line, so re-signing Klay wouldn\'t cost them anything but money.\n\n2. Waive CP3. That puts them below the tax line, and re-signing Klay would hinder their ability to add other players (for example, using the NTMLE).\n\nThe Warriors were waiting to see how that unfolded before approaching Klay, and Klay (reasonably) didn\'t like that he was more of an afterthought than a priority.', ""It's always so overdramatic.

God damn.', 'Article makes it seem like Klay leaving wasn‚Äôt really a sudden change of mind thing even as it mentions the fact that the Warriors didn‚Äôt Klay a contract during the mandatory cycle where teams get to negotiate with their own free agents before any other team. \n\nHonestly that sounds about right. It sucks, but what‚Äôs most clear is that Klay just wasn‚Äôt good at dictating leverage at all and it was amplified through a combination of missed opportunities and plain bad luck. \n\nWell I mean, shit. Best of luck to him.', 'Man this is an AI written headline if I‚Äôve ever seen one', 'That first paragraph sounds like something I wrote in high school to make sure I got to the length requirement of an essay.', 'But did they try kidnapping him?', ""This writing is BEYOND atrocious lol.

What a little bitch.', ""Aside from that headline-- which, *oof*-- my main takeaway from this entire scenario is that if Golden State hadn't enjoyed unprecedented success with the Curry/Thompson/Green trio over the years, Thompson would've left a while back. He's just a different person and maybe didn't feel like he was always the greatest fit there in an interpersonal way, and that's totally okay. It doesn't take anything from his accomplishments or the success they had, and now he gets to experience a different sort of environment in Dallas.

Dude doesn‚Äôt realise he isn‚Äôt even in Pippen to Jordan, McHale to Bird, Wade to LeBron territory. Klay was a great supporting player, but never a superstar level with Curry, and maybe not even a star player without Curry. The amount of gravity that Curry gave Klay allowed him to shoot so many good shots. Maybe when it‚Äôs all done he can reflect on his experiences and not left it make him bitter and hateful like Pippen.', 'Steph: I wasn‚Äôt planning to bruh. Dunt need your 0-10 ass staying around.', 'Jesus Christ someone just give me a TLDR of literally the title', 'So basically the warriors had zero communication with klays agent this offseason and last season‚Äôs offer may not be as concrete as we think.\n\nI don‚Äôt really blame klay for leaving and I‚Äôm not sure why he‚Äôs getting so much hate. He just left in free agency lol what‚Äôs wrong with that', ""The Earth's ability to support humanity is dying and this guy is spouting fuckin soliloquies about a millionaire crybaby"", 'Good read.', ""**Tldr;** Joe Lacob likes to play staring contests that usually backfire, and they had 3 summers to extend Klay.
