*In my defense I was typing with one hand","Same points as Bronny vs Okc || Butler needs to score more and be more aggressive  if teams are defending curry like that. || It puts LeBron not scoring under 10 since bush was president in to perspective || Holy shit lmao || Haters were waiting for this || First Houston locked up Duke and now my man Curry üò≠üò≠ || Amen Thompson saved this franchise üôèüèº || Bronny James scoring numbers lol || One of the greatest hate watches of the season man. Ime is one hell of a defensive minded coach because curry was getting covered everywhere on the perimeter. || Bronny scored just as much || Also got cooked by Jalen green on the last two possessions that still mattered in the 4th || Really puts into perspective how crazy it is LeBron hasn‚Äôt scored in single digits since ‚Äò07 || Man when Steph is bad he is really really bad lol. || Bro turned into Klay || lebron gets this stat line its top all time on this sub || Someone needs to make a compilation on Amens defense tonight. 

Athletic, sure, but he is an absolute relentless dawg. 1st team all defense. || Tbf he was getting double teamed all game, wasn't just Amen || Rockets defence had him in prison, Jalen Green had him on islands on offence. 

Just an all around bad night for Curry. || his first name is Wardell || Well, it happens, terrific defense, bad shooting night etc. But I can't imagine if this happened to LeBron.",2025-04-06

I'm sorry but this needs to be said even though I believe any basketball fan already knows this but Steph got a worse whistle than a fucking 10 day player. 

Like there were actual moments in the game where you could see Grizzlies were trying to foul him intentionally and refs just kept watching. 

Now I know I know, illegal screens, he only shoots 3, doesn't drive argument people will come as they always do but if you watched this match and still deny or say it equates to how he's grabbed like a doll in every possession, then you have the right to your opinion. 

That's all, just felt like saying it, especially after watching this game. || If Steph had Shai's whistle Scottie Pippen Jr would have fouled out in the first quarter || SKY IS FUCKED TONIGHT || Scotty Pippen Jr ends with 2 personal fouls btw. || For anyone that didn't watch that was one of the worst one sided officiating I've ever watched and the warriors still won. Starting from the second quarter they were letting memphis do everything to steph and giving memphis all the calls when JJJ and Edey were in the paint. It was insanely blatant. || Anyone see Ja put up finger guns and the commentators refusing to comment on it? lol || This game was a referee masterclass.

2025-03-03,Insane LeBron stat: the difference between his and Stephen Curry‚Äôs total minutes (Reg. + Playoffs) is greater than the difference between Curry‚Äôs and Anthony Edward‚Äôs total minutes. Curry is 36 and Ant is 23.,"LeBron has played 70,332 total minutes.

They wanted to expand the competition to include Caitlin Clark, and Klay Thompson ‚Äî but when Clark declined it all but doomed it","[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6129842/2025/02/13/stephen-curry-sabrina-ionescu-3-point-contest-all-star-weekend-off?source=user-shared-article)

>It appears there will be no Stephen Curry-Sabrina Ionescu rematch after all.

>Curry and Ionescu stole All-Star Saturday night in Indianapolis last year with a first-of-its-kind, 3-point shootout between them, narrowly won by Curry, but the two will not run it back during this weekend‚Äôs festivities in San Francisco, league sources told The Athletic.



> The NBA‚Äôs front office did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation, but sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations said Curry and Ionescu were not interested in a simple rematch. They wanted to expand the competition to include WNBA superstar Caitlin Clark, and potentially Curry‚Äôs former teammate Klay Thompson ‚Äî but when Clark, through a statement issued by her sports agency in January, declined to participate, saying she ‚Äúwants her first 3-point contest to be at WNBA All-Star in Indianapolis this summer,‚Äù it all but doomed the men-against-women shooting contest.

>League officials attempted to resurrect the Curry-Ionescu competition in some form as late as Wednesday, multiple league sources said, but couldn‚Äôt convince both parties to sign on for a rematch. There was even talk of pushing the competition to Sunday during a break in the reformatted All-Star game, but that didn‚Äôt pick up steam.","Do it during the WNBA all star week. They need the ratings bump more. || Honestly I don‚Äôt blame Clark. She went from college senior year instantly into the WNBA. She got no break, she‚Äôs probably just enjoying her first offseason in a minute. || Ionescu lighting it up at the all star games last year is what made me get into the WNBA and become a Liberty fan. Hope that it wasn‚Äôt just a one off thing. || Wonder if they aren‚Äôt interested in putting someone like Ogunbowale or Plum. Maybe not enough star power. || Clark has too much to lose by participating. With the way social media is now, if she had an MVP season in the W but didn‚Äôt do well in the three point contest the latter is what a lot of people would be talking about

There‚Äôs also a decent chance she would underwhelm, because despite the hype her three point accuracy isn‚Äôt her greatest strength - I‚Äôd assume Ionescu would perform better || Clark is still recouping from her Whirlwind 2024.

Looking forward to May, but not holding my breath || Bummer for us but I get it. Could bring a lot of views to the WNBA all star game. || Angel Reese vs Draymond Green rebound contest instead || Get Kayla McBride, she's the best shooter in the league right now || She wants to do the WNBA contest first & I commend her. Weird loaded reporting. || Ionescu had surgery on her thumb in December, so I have a feeling that must've played a part in her decision. Also, it benefits the women to do it during the W All Star break because they'll be mid-season, so much much sharper - I'm sure that was considered, as well.

All this said though and I think they should expand the contest to include more players. Kayla McBride in particular is probably the best 3pt shooter in the W right now - it'd be a mistake not have her partake || Aren't there other women's players they could invite? It doesn't have to be limited to Ionescu and Clark. || > Clark, through a statement issued by her sports agency in January, declined to participate, saying she ‚Äúwants her first 3-point contest to be at WNBA All-Star in Indianapolis this summer,‚Äù

Makes sense.  If you want to see her in a 3 point contest, she wants you to watch the WNBA All-Star event. || If the NBA isn‚Äôt paying Clark, then she should pass. She doesn‚Äôt need more exposure whereas the NBA needs a reason for people to watch the meh all star weekend.

Makes a lot more sense for them to go to the WNBA all star weekend and do this than the NBA so that their ratings would see a huge boost. || Think that‚Äôs fair enough. Just do it next year after Clark has done her first WNBA one || Didn't they used to have a 3pt shootout with the teams being made up of an NBA player, WNBA player, and a retired player?

It could be fun to do something like that again. Still go with the 2 on 2 contest but pair the best NBA shooter with the 2nd best WNBA and vice versa or as the WNBA expands, have teams of two from the NBA-WNBA teams in the same region.

Have it be an event at both the NBA All-Star and WNBA All-Star events. || Would be fun if they did a ‚Äúhome and home‚Äù series each year, with game 1 during the NBA all star game, and the rematch at the WNBA all star game. || Man we went from players ducking the dunk contest to stars duckigg the 3 pt contest || We can add more confusing elements to skills challenge every year or have G League guys run the dunk contest but god forbid you put another wnba shooter in Clark's place.

Klay and Steph teaming up or facing off in GS would be the selling point of the night. Sabrina/Steph continues until you get Clark next year. You help the W out. Just throwing away an easy fun event. 

Watch us get a stupid segment of like Curry vs Kevin Hart instead || Why klay? I get they are the splash brothers but those days are loooong gone. They ain't even on the same team anymore....

> At some point in the last several days, Stephen Curry had a conversation with Kevin Durant that convinced him a reunion was extremely unlikely, no matter how much the Golden State Warriors ownership group and front office collectively ‚Äúunderestimated‚Äù Durant‚Äôs coldness toward a return, as one team source put it.
> 
> 
> Eventually the decision-makers accepted the inevitable and pivoted their NBA trade deadline plans to Jimmy Butler. Bradley Beal‚Äôs no-trade clause locked the Phoenix Suns out of the Butler sweepstakes.

> Butler and the Warriors can be viewed as backup plans for each other, a marriage of circumstance between two sides who desired ‚Äî and probably still do desire ‚Äî others. But they‚Äôre here now. The Warriors used their leverage as the Miami Heat‚Äôs best leftover suitor to flip Andrew Wiggins, Dennis Schr√∂der, Kyle Anderson and a 2025 top-10 protected first-rounder for Butler, in what they believe is a modest outgoing package for the Curry co-star they so desperately craved.","Regardless of Draymond being involved in a trade or not for KD

I think he just didn't want to go back to the Warriors || He didn‚Äôt feel like taking the hardest road twice || ""Sincerely fuck off""

-Kevin Durant || Ultimately I think the roasting KD got for going to the Warriors and how a lot of people have dismissed his titles made him realize that going back there meant he could never really escape the ‚Äúoh you just had to go back to Steph and the Warriors‚Äù to try to win. And that‚Äôs on top of his well documented issues with Draymond, and even Kerr.

With Phoenix he isn‚Äôt winning but honestly he‚Äôs not getting a ton of media scrutiny either. The spotlight would be back on him in Golden State and probably not in a good way either. Eventually he‚Äôll probably find his way off of Phoenix for a final run but it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for it to be Golden State. || Chopping it up with old coworkers and they ask if you wanna come back.

That is the loudest narrative against him and is the biggest contextual reason for why Draymond blew up at him to begin with. KD was already one foot out the door. Durant cares about the perception of himself and his career way more than he let's on. He wants to be a bus driver because that's what most people convinced him was the right thing to do. 

Him and Draymond have made up with that beef long ago. Draymond was wrong then, wrong now, and will be wrong tomorrow but he's not the reason KD doesn't want to come back. He wants to prove to people that he's a top 10 player of all time and to do that he needs to win outside golden state. At least that's the narrative people hold against him. Its just like how everyone held not winning a finals mvp against Steph || dumbasses keep talking about DEI but it's nepotism that gets unqualified people like Kirk Lacob in positions || I still don‚Äôt quite understand this.

We had a 30 pts lead by the end of the 3rd quarter || OKC the entire 4th q: ""THE DEVIL NAMED STEPH CURRY IS HURTING US!"" || Bro. I've been watching Shai actively try to get fouled all season. Just play like last season because if your own fans are noticing it you need to chill. || It's 2030 and 42 years-old Stephen Curry would still be shooting 3-pointers to end other teams || Shai 24 points on 14 FTA is fucking nasty work || I did not expect the Warriors and the Thunder to have identical records at *any* point of the season. I thought the Warriors were a play-in team again at best. Now they're 8-2 with wins over Boston and OKC back to back? What is happening? || I miss the olympics when Steph wasn't doing this against my team || GG warriors, hopefully Chet is not out for long because playing small ball 48 minutes a game will not be fun || Curry outplayed Shai, and that was honestly the difference that decided this game || I never want to see the Warriors get another 30 point lead in my life.

Wtf? || You *cannot* take the foot off the gas against this Thunder team, their defense was absolutely stifling. Without Steph's clutch 3s I think Thunder complete the comeback. || Crazy that Steph needed to come back into the game to finish it. Those okc bench guys can all play. 



I'm salty about Shai's whistle man, rivals prime Harden's. Most stars can get away with the pushoff but his is like completely throwing the defender. I feel like his game doesn't need to foul bait that often to be effective. || Watching the Niners, Warriors and Cal win but blow large leads signals that‚Äôs enough sports for one weekend || SGA was literally shoving defenders off their legal guarding positions and getting free throws... || OKC has 3 injured centers so we‚Äôre just OK now :( || This Warriors team is legit for the regular season. Not sure this deep rotation will stand up in the play-offs, 1 piece away from a run? || Death taxes and Steph curry torching the thunder are all things that are guaranteed in life . Really hope Chet is okay || getting outscored by 17 in the fourth, just normal warriors things || Steph: 36pts, 4 freethrows (1 off a take foul and 3 in garbage time)

SGA: 24pts, 14 freethrows

EDIT: OKC lost Chet like 3 minutes into the game and fought back from down 28pts. I'm just petty because SGA always writes corny ahh captions on Insta when the Thunder beat the Warriors",2024-11-10
2024-11-06,"Stephen Curry in win vs Celtics: 27 PTS (8-17 FG) (4-9 3P) (7-7 FT), 7 REB, 9 AST, 4 STL, 1 BLK",,"His defense has been so good, I hope history remembers how he improved at it later in his career || GSW has anti Celtics aura. Steph is crazy man || TD Steph hits different || Classic || Does that say 7 FTA for Steph? || I LOVE YOU STEPHEN WARDELL CURRY || Celtic fans let the hate out your heart regarding Steve Kerr and his Olympic rotation lol.

I believe I heard Steve Kerr suck chant lol like seriouly || That‚Äôs my clutch player of the year. || Steph ""DPOY"" Curry || I LOVE STEPH CURRY || Surgical!! || WE ARE SO FUCKING BACK || Best player in the world || they kept trying to get him on the mismatch and gave up || Steph is just hitting his prime || Give Steph An AD, Siakam, Beal, Booker, Kyrie as a second‚Ä¶ || MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN || I loved Tatum leaving him wide open for that 3 lol || Imagine thinking he‚Äôs worse than tatum || Is it too early to say The Warriors are better without Klay?",2024-11-06
