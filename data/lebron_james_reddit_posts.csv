(@DanWoikeSports)","Damn Lebrun gonna drop 28/8/8 at bronnys retirement game at this point || ‚ÄúIf I wanted to, this fuckery could go on‚Äù

-LeBron James || The main question is if he‚Äôs willing to take a pay cut. || How many more years? Not 1, not 2, not 3... || I hope we all don‚Äôt over exaggerate. By high level I doubt he means number 1 or 2 option. This sounds like he‚Äôs saying he thinks he could be a solid role player in another 5 to 7 years if he was still in the league then. || If high level is 25mpg, I believe him || As long as Ben Simmons can still get playing time, LeBron can still son many youngins. || Probably could but would probably miss more games every season. 

Wasn't it Jalen Rose that said the skills and IQ will still be there. It's the ability to recover that really makes one retire. || [removed] || People act like this is a joke but forget wilt was in crazy shape in his later years. Elite athletes are elite for a reason. Genetics, discipline, drive all just on another level. || This man‚Äôs gonna play until he can also force Bryce onto the Lakers and he‚Äôll play with both Bronny and Bryce at the same time. || I believe him. I watched Tom Brady play til he was 45 and LeBron invests just as much if not not more in his body and preparation. || Not four, not five, not six...


Estimating has never been his strong suit. || No one lives forever, no one. But with advances in modern science and my high level income, it's not crazy to think I can live to be 245, maybe 300. Heck, I just read in the newspaper that they put a pig heart in some guy from Russia. Do you know what that means? || ""to be honest, if I really wanted to I could win 2-3 more rings, if I wanted to. But I'm not gonna do that."" || LeBron is a funny ass dude tbh. He keeps telling himself that he wants to retire and once he's done he's done, but dude is the real life bronsexual. He's obsessed with basketball. His love for the game is actually second to none.

If the Lakers weren't so ass, of if LeBron James Jr. was 5 inches taller he'd prolly fuck around and play til his early 50s. || ""We're all told at some point in time that we can no longer play the children's game, we just don't... don't know when that's gonna be.

/s || Lebron is still playing like a TOP 15 player in the league. Sometimes even top 10.

My Hot Take is Steph and KD will also still be a 
Top 15 player in the league. When they reach 40.

Idk why.

But there is something about these 3 that makes themselves still All Nba Second or Third team level players even if they are 40 or reaching it.

Cp3, Harden, Russ, and Even Kawhi (to some extent) got washed or damaged now. 

Yet, Lebron, KD, Steph are still All Nba Level Players. || I can‚Äôt believe I watched LeBron go from avg middy but elite driving game, to point guard to a centre and he causally having is best season as a 3pt shooter‚Ä¶ bro wtf

"[McMenamin] LeBron James, when asked about changes to the NBA All-Star Game format, touched on more issues with the league: ‚ÄúOur game, there‚Äôs a lot of f‚Äîing 3s being shot. So it‚Äôs a bigger conversation than just the All-Star Game‚Äù",,"LeFedUp || The NBA has been around for 80 years

Can we make it where when the offensive player jumps into a defender that it‚Äôs an offensive foul? || Okc fan here, can confirm || MLB is truly the model to follow here but judging by Silvers comments he thinks the game is fine.

Baseball was too slow: they introduced the pitch clock.

Analytics said stolen bases was ineffective: they made the bases larger to encourage stealing and make it more valuable.

Excessive shifts took away excitement from the game: they removed it.

NBA has made so many rule changes to benefit the offense but almost 0 in years to benefit the defense. I think you can keep the 3 pointer and add the ability for defenders to defend and then iterate and go from there. || The low post game is almost non existence and it makes me sad. || It's extremely easy to fix the rampant 3's. Just call moving screens and travels, which give insane advantages to perimeter players.

They're free to come off of screens at 100mph, fully knowing that they can take 3 steps after catching a pass to get to their spot, stabilize, choose whichever pivot they want as they set their feet up for a shot, while the refs swallow their whistles. I mean, for real, high school refs would be blowing out lung tissue in their eagerness to call something like [this](https://streamable.com/rdi1rl). NBA refs just let people do whatever, so plays like that one happen 50 times per game.

Call the game appropriately, let defenders count on the rulebook to work with them instead of against them, and that will inevitably lead to greater diversity of play, instead of a competition of who can build the better 5-out offense. || They optimized the fun out of the game || Doesn't help that the new generational stars have either out right dismissed it like Shai and Ant or give 0 shits in game like Jokic and Luka. Not singling them out as the only culprits but doesn't help. || Its not the 3 point shooting. Its the officiating. The biggest issue is the offensive players purposely creating contact to draw fouls, and then that not being called consistently unless you are a super star. 

And start calling moving screens and stop letting guys take one dribble past half court and get a layup. Its ridiculous. || Is this quote taken out of context or does this answer have nothing to do with the question?

I'm also pretty sick of seeing this take everywhere. Offensive players getting to get away with virtually anything making defense impossible is much more of a bigger issue with the game today || These players can‚Äôt shoot 3 without traveling, carrying and illegal screen.  Just look at how many players can make 3s without changing their pivot foot from catching non ideal pass. || The game is not in a good spot and no that‚Äôs not old head talk. Even less than 10 years ago you had variety in offenses. It‚Äôs not a fun product to watch || Analytics mathematized the game of basketball || They should reintroduce hand checking and actually enforce the rules against flopping. || I keep seeing fingers being pointed at the 3 pointer making the game less fun. I guess. I‚Äôll argue it‚Äôs the fuck‚Äôn foul line killing the game. They‚Äôre taking too many foul shots, and they‚Äôre spending too much time at the line while they‚Äôre up there. 

Stop calling touch fouls, *actually* regulate flopping out of the game, and stop allowing shooters to lean into defenders to initiate contact and draw the foul. At the line, ban high fives and handshakes in between shots. Add a god damn pitch clock, and enforce it. Not ten seconds to shoot each shot. You have 20(?) seconds to get both shots off. Shoot the ball and keep your feet planted because the ball is coming back at you. Giannis taking 90 seconds, or whatever, to get 2 foul shots off 8 times a game is unwatchable.

As for maybe regulating the three. Enforce moving screen violations. Maybe loosen the hand- checking rules at the perimeter. And again, not allowing the shooter to lean into a defender to initiate contact and draw a foul could help. || Let them handcheck and let defenders decide lay defense. Stop rewarding guys like embiid and SGA. Do some rule changes to stop flopping. No one wants to see 100 stoppages during a game. || Yall were hating on Shaq for saying this and calling him an out of touch oldhead. Seeing teams shoot 50 3s per game is bad for basketball, the product looks no different than your rec league at the local lifetime fitness || Steph, Klay, Dame, and even Harden really made the whole world think they could shoot the three || allow hand checking from 3pt line to 3pt line. call moving screens, offensive players jumping into the defense, carries, and travels || Fiba games are much better to watch than Nba games.¬† Maybe they should look into that",2024-12-19

Johnny is an NHL player for the Blue Jackets.","Some additional context:

Johnny Gaudreau (aka Johnny Hockey) was an exceptionally talented and flashy hockey player well-known throughout the NHL. An All-Rookie, All-NHL first teamer, World Juniors gold medalist, seven-time All-Star and a mainstay of the NHL Skills Competition, you could perhaps liken him from a talent/significance perspective to a Kyrie Irving or Damian Lillard. Additionally, he was one of the few US-born superstars in the NHL and probably would have been a very significant part of Team USA at the NHL's much-anticipated return to the Olympics.

Johnny and his brother Matthew (himself a talented college hockey player who teamed with Johnny in Boston) were in town to be groomsmen at their sister's wedding, which was to take place today (Friday).

The two brothers were out riding their bicycles together, minutes from their home, around 8:30 PM last night, when an SUV driving near them moved closer to the middle of the two-lane road to create space from them. A Jeep that had been following then recklessly attempted to overtake the SUV and, in the process,  struck and killed both brothers. The driver of the Jeep was intoxicated.

39 years old and turns 40 in a month and a half btw.

LIVE.LAUGH.LOVE #striveforgreatnessüöÄ #thekidfromakronüëë #jamesgangüëë #bronknows || Thank god this fuckery won‚Äôt continue much longer || He's in his 5th prime. 

1st prime was uber athletic wonder kid Cavs LeBron. Not much of a shooter or post player, not as good of a playmaker, but a cyborg who plays 48 mins a game and dominates through sheer athleticism. Puts dudes in posters nightly, makes a stupendously athletic play at least once per quarter. Aside from a blip year in 2006-07, he was also a consistent free throw shooter. The 48 Special LeBron who scored 29 of the last 30 points and killed the 00s Pistons. The LeBron who averaged a whopping 38-8-8 in a losing effort against Dwight's Magic in the 09 ECF.

2nd prime was Miami LeBron, still with otherworldly athleticism but combined with maturity, efficiency, and smarts molded from years of playoff heartbreaks. Becomes a defensive juggernaut with vastly improved outside shooting and post-play. Develops into a fearsome crunchtime performer, shedding the unclutch reputation by transcending the usual definition of clutch. Probably the best prime in terms of stats, efficiency, and free throw shooting. Game 6 Boston killer LeBron. Villain masked LeBron and first sighting of headband-less LeBron. Killed the hopes and dreams of PG13 (then PG24) Pacers, Big 3 Celtics, and D-Rose Bulls.

3rd prime was LeDad LeBron of the Cavs. Athleticism, defense, efficiency, and shooting all drop a little, becomes someone who picks spots. Headband has been shed. LeCoast during the regular season in full swing, LeFlipping the Switch becomes a thing. But all of this made up by the fact that he has become the league's most intelligent player, controlling the flow of the game offensively and defensively and still having the athletic gifts to make it happen. By this time he has become the league's premier 4th quarter player, in supreme control of anything that happens on the court during crunchtime. Saves up his best performances in the playoffs. Has become ass in the charity stripe, unfortunately. Vintage LeBron free throw: clank the first, hit the second. The LeBron who becomes the first player in history to lead all players in the 5 major statistical categories in a playoff series (doing it in the Finals). 2018 Playoffs Legend who dragged the Cleveland LeBrons to the Finals. Dawn of the LeBronto. The Nightmare of the Trash Brothers Raptors and Spurs East Hawks. Triggered the birth of arguably the most stacked team in NBA history.

4th prime is LeBron ""Magic Johnson"" James. Athleticism again drops a bit, more load management and more LeCoast. But has evolved to a playmaking savant, becoming Prime Magic of Showtime 2.0. Still with the chops to dominate a game during crunch time. Once in a blue moon still puts a guy on a poster but more often than not, goes for a simple lay-up or least physically-stressing move. Picks his spots even more and chooses the best time to dominate. LeCloser. LeMickey Mouse Champion.

5th prime is LeOld Man Strength LeBron. Post-pandemic all-time scoring LeGOAT has adapted into a refined, masterful floor general who uses IQ over athleticism. He‚Äôs all about efficiency now, shooting more from deep and picking his spots to go all out. Less dunks, more step-back threes and crafty footwork in the post. When he does turn it on, he still flashes that prime 2012 Bron dominance, reminding everyone that he‚Äôs still here, still a threat, and still shaping the game. LeMentor to AD and the younger guys, LeBron‚Äôs balanced approach is extending his career, making him both the steady leader and occasional game-changer his team needs. || We should not be hesitant to trade picks. 

The West is relatively open and LeBron and AD are both playing like Top 10 players.

"Barack Obama's Starting 5: Stephen Curry, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Hakeem Olajuwon","Barack Obama, executive producer of the new Netflix series Starting 5, starring Jimmy Butler and Domantas Sabonis, was asked to name his Starting 5. 

[https://x.com/BarackObama/status/1845503860296778159](https://x.com/BarackObama/status/1845503860296778159)

Barack Obama's squad is:

**PG -** Stephen Curry  
**SG -** Michael Jordan  
**SF -** LeBron James  
**PF -** Kevin Durant  
**C -**   Hakeem Olajuwon

This is a very strong starting 5 and it's hard to argue with what he did with the 1-4 spots, as Curry/Kevin Durant are just the perfect superstars to fit around more ball dominant players, while being creative with the ball themselves.

The only potentially controversial spot on the team is the center position. Obama may have underrated the value he could get by going small ball with a power forward like Tim Duncan at the center spot, the pure dominance of prime Shaq, or using Nikola Jokic as an offensive facilitator and three point threat himself. ","Better question:

If Obama were to name a starting five of US Presidents which would he pick?

Lincoln at center || For this team I'd rather have Hakeem over Shaq || Shaq is for sure voting for Trump now. || >Obama may have underrated the value he could get by going small ball with a power forward like Tim Duncan at the center spot

Tim Duncan already played center for most of his career. A 7 foot player at center is NOT small ball. || Obama knows ball || lol thats my exact 5. Hakeem over Shaq/Kareem may be controversial but its not like they need more scoring. best defender of all time next to Miami Bron and Goat MJ is 2-way excellence. || Hakeem is the right choice. I'd take prime Hakeem over all the dudes you mentioned. He was a very versatile center and could play modern positionless ball as well as anyone. || What starting 5 all time beats this one? || People listing their five and not having bron is bonkers.¬† || I love any starting 5 that doesn't force Kobe onto the SF position in order to get Kobe/Jordan on the same team. || Trump‚Äôs starting 5: Stockton, Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, Karl Malone, Bill Laimbeer¬† || Obama knows ball || Hakeem is a fine choice. Forget about his offense his defense is legendary || Arguably the perfect 5. It's wild that among that group, KD and Steph actually played together.¬†¬† || >starring Jimmy Butler and Domantas Sabonis

I don't know why but that gave me a chuckle. || Shaq fell to his knees at a Papa John's when he read this || Accolades aside, Hakeem can give it to anyone and is probably the best alongside Bill Russell as the greatest defenders of their positions. || Wait a minute‚Ä¶.

Edit:Bill Simmons article about it at the time
https://grantland.com/features/the-consequences-caring/ || Probably a little biased talking about his son here, but not crazy talk. I go back and forth between the last 3 Miami years and the second Cleveland stint as his absolute peak. Just exerted control over every facet of the game, it was incredibly special to watch. || Miami was his physical peak but the second Cleveland stint was when his cerebral dominance became undeniable. He damn near beat the young Warriors dynasty on his own that first year, and was the only reason for the last 2 matchups.      
     
Though the most impressive bit of his career is what the Lakers run has shown us, the absurd longevity. || I think 2016 Finals LeBron and 2018 Playoffs LeBron are arguably also his best versions. || LeBron definitely would have won a DPOY during his Miami stint if he played before the rise of advanced stats.

That's not to say he wouldn't have deserved it, but at some point it became impossible for anyone other then a defense first player to win that award. || I say this exact same thing. I watched every Heat game during that time. I dont understand how there could be a better player than he was during that time. He was able to do anything on the floor at an all star level except shoot free throws.¬† || That could well be true. LeBron‚Äôs offensive height was probably later after he returned to the Cavs, especially in around 17-18 or so, but the Heat is when he married stupidly elite offense to what was probably the best perimeter D in the game, right before the rise of Kawhi. He was also definitely at his athletic peak then. 

(Most of) Miami Heat LeBron was probably the filthiest all-around player we‚Äôve ever seen when you take into account every aspect of the game. Not only zero holes on both ends of the court, but virtually all strengths, even 3s to some extent. || Peak lebron is 2013, his best overall is 2018

Peak Jordan is 90-92, his best overall is 97

Their peaks was when they could do everything athletic and they was physically dominant enough to overpower the opposition. Their best was when maybe the lost a bit of a step but they was so mentally ahead there was nothing the opponent could do (okay GS fine you got me).

The best way i out is Floyd peak/prime is prettyboy so late 90s early 2000s but his best performance was against Canelo in my view || Considering how old Greg Oden is, I thought he'd be a George Mikan guy || üòÇA lot of us agreeü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è just wish Greg career wasn‚Äôt hindered with injuries hell of a talent || Then he's not a Michael Jordan guy lmao || Is that Johnny Manziel? || Lebron was better on the Cavs after the Heat.

Case closed. || Dirk and the boys beat a goat at the height of his career. Got it. || Personally I disagree, but it's a fair argument. Miami LeBron wasn't as strong a shooter as he is now, but imo that's still the best version of LeBron.

LeBron James was already becoming well known in 2002. In 2024 he is still a top player in the world. How much does his longevity distort the reception of NBA players in general?,"If you were 8 years old in 2003, You have no real world perception of time, especially in terms of what time does to an athlete. For all you know, LeBron James has *always* been in the NBA. 

Of course you learn these things as you get older, but now you're almost 30, you may have an 8 year old of your own, and he also becomes a fan of the NBA and LeBron James. 

LeBron isn't coming off the bench to play a few minutes in a swan song season the way most players his age do. And most of the truly great players retire a couple years earlier because they don't want to be seen as anything less than great. They don't want to fade away. Either that or they are physically unable to continue playing. 

There are parent and child duos watching LeBron James be the best player on the floor where that has been the case for as long as the parent can remember. Read that again. Has that *ever* happened for the NBA before? Does MJ count? He was no where near as effective in his wizards years, and his return, while interesting, had an ""Old Man coming back to give it one more go"" vibe. While LeBron is Old, he's still as effective as he's ever been, and voted the best player on the best team in the world. 

There's an entire generation of people who know logically, because people can't shut up about it (including myself, clearly), how rare this is. But it distorts the reality of what people are capable of and I think that will have a lasting affect on people's perception of NBA players for years to come.","The only thing he has left to do is get the elusive *27-7-7* || We don't treat Steph, KD, CP3 (until last year) as old men because of Lebron || What‚Äôs crazy to me is LeBron James is unanimously agreed to be on the ‚Äúdecline‚Äù where he is now only a top 5-10 player in the league. 

That‚Äôs a DECLINE for this man. What the actual hell || LeBron distorts everything because he single-handedly obliterates the peak vs longevity argument which is huge in every sport.

What even is his ‚Äúpeak‚Äù? The fucker has like three separate primes. And his longevity is beyond insane, how many ‚Äúyoungest to‚Äù *and* ‚Äúoldest to‚Äù records does he hold? Last season at 39 he averaged 26/7/8 on a comical 63% TS, basically better than his already ridiculous career averages. At 39. 

I‚Äôm not gonna delve into the endless GOAT debate but Bron, at the risk of stating the obvious, sure as fuck has a lot going for him. || There‚Äôs NBA players who have never lived in a world where LeBron is not in the NBA. And in the top 5% of the league the entire time on top of that. Mostly #1

It‚Äôs pretty wild. || It's crazy how great he still is.

Al Horford is seen as the old veteran.  ""Can you believe he's still playing??""  and ""He's been out there a long time!"" and now they have to rest him, alternate games so he doesn't get overtired, and every year he still plays, people say ""wow, one more year for Old Man Horford!!""

He's a year younger than LeBron. || In terms of longevity, the closest thing we have in the NBA is Kareem who was a top 5 MVP finisher 15 years apart. || My cousin went to jail for attempted murder in 07 and he recently got out and told me that one of the only things that has remained the same in the last SEVENTEEN YEARS was that lebron was still really good || Have to embrace what is happening as this is once in a lifetime where a player like LeBron is able to sustain the bump and grind of NBA. || The hype surrounding LeBron was truly incredible given this was pre-youtube and pre-social media. Bootleg highlight videos were shared on P2P networks like limewire and he was sorta considered a myth. Then his high school games started airing on ESPN. 



By the time he was drafted the Jordan level expectations were there and he somehow lived up the hype. Just unreal, and this is from someone who hasn't really been a fan of his after he left Cleveland in 2010.


Edit: typo || How crazy is KDs longevity? What about Steph? People don't even register that because of the bonkers LeBron moving the goalpost as they are doing it. || LeBron is the golden standard for basketball hands down. Nobody has accomplished longevity like him, hes had no off court issues, he's a great father, and you can tell his peers respect him.

He's a great guy who exceeded the biggest expectations any player has ever had. || People think Blake Griffin is a bum, but that guy has been consistently good for 8 years (2011-2019)

8 years and people will still forget you.

LBJ has been doing this since Chris Evans is the Human Torch. || We haven‚Äôt seen anything yet. Wait until after LeBron retires and see how we distort history to prop him up and or put him down. 

I saw a wacky thread on Sunday where someone wanted to argue that Jordan played against modern day defenses back in the 80‚Äôs. 

The same will happen in due time for some of the current day greats. Especially LeBron. || It‚Äôs the greatest longevity i‚Äôve seen in such a demanding sport. Who comes close, maybe Gretzky?

Just a once in a lifetime combination + his hard work, it'll never be done again. And as an old head who watched Jordan, we can sit here picking nits about who had the higher peak, but LeBron is just unquestionably the most talented, most dominant human being who's ever played basketball, and now he has the greatest, most dominant career of all time. It'll never be done again. I can't imagine what his accolades would look like if he had been drafted by a competent team and he/Klutch kept their noses out of front office business.

LeBron James is only 6 field goals away from having the most career misses in NBA history,"To be clear, this isn't a hate post. It's honestly a testament to how long and successful of a career LeBron has had to even have the opportunity to attempt this many shots in the first place. 

Of course, given the LeBron hate train and how much haters like to twist the narrative, I'm shocked this has flown under the radar. According to Statmuse:

1. Kobe Bryant - 14,481 FG Misses
2. LeBron James - 14,476 FG Misses
3. John Havlicek - 13,417 FG Misses

He'll likely get there in next season's opener. Who knows how long this record will last if he keeps playing at this level...

For context, LeBron has played 146 more regular season games than Kobe (1492 vs 1346) and has taken 3,113 more FG attempts than Kobe (29,313 vs. 26,200).

Gotta be really damn good to accrue the most of a negative stat! And yes I know that‚Äôs what you are going for OP, just wanted to reiterate your point. || Kobe set the record in just 1,252 games. LeBron still hasn‚Äôt done it in 1,492 games. Shows the difference in their scoring accuracy and efficiency. || So for a period of time, the record for both the most and fewest misses in NBA history will be held (or tied) by a LeBron James || Kobe being number 1 in this list is such a Kobe thing. || He has a career TS% of 58.9%. That's really good! || LeBrick, Jordan would never. || Lebron once went 120/329 in a month. 36%
Havlicek once went 127/357 in a month. 35%
Kobe once went 70/225 in a month. 31% || I hope they pause the game to celebrate it || Kareem not being in that top 3 is wild. As is Kobe not having been passed by LeBron yet. || People aren't bringing it up because he's never going to miss a shot again || Isn‚Äôt he only 6 MISSED field goals away? || Damn it took him 20 years that‚Äôs mad impressive. The one thing people forget to consider about lebron career is that he has been hella efficient throughout his career. || Scared money don‚Äôt make none || He's gonna only dunk it from here on out || And he has over 7000 more total points. || He gonna take no FGs going forward.  This season he will average 0p/17r/35a || You never make 100 percent of the shots you take the most",2024-07-09
"LeBron ""Father Time"" James tonight in loss to Suns: 11 PTS on 3-14 FG, 5 REB, 8 AST",,"[deleted] || ""Swing swing mf""

Rui probably || This is probably more of an issue playing 3 games in 4 nights to start the year || He looked old tonight. Bad on both ends and no hustle during crucial clutch moments || Bron plays bad: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs 40 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äù

Bron plays good: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs 40 ü§©‚Äù

I can‚Äôt lose || worst game i‚Äôve seen him play live tbh but he‚Äôll be okay || Oldest player ever to have 11 points on October 28th or some shit. || Father Time won today || at least he kept the streak alive || Where tf was this Saturday? || Somebody get this man a blood boy. || Used up his energy last game lmfao || The last free throw was funny as shit. || Bro was so ass tonight || Time is Lebron James father || LeLoss. || LeOld James. || You light my fire

I feel alive with you, baby

You blow my mind

I‚Äôm satisfied || Dunngeon || Hit the clutch 3 to save his double digit streak tho lol",2024-10-29
"LeBron James: ""I believe in 08 or 09 or whenever that light-skinned fucker came into the league in Golden State, he changed the narrative. He single-handedly changed the 'no lead is safe'. Steph & Allen Iverson are the 2 biggest influential guys in our game since I've been watching & covering it""",,"LeReporter been covering the NBA way before woj || Man, this show looks so good. They're running great promo with these clips, I can't wait for the full eps. || He‚Äôs right about the AI & Steph thing. All the kids want/wanted to play just like them growing up. || Y'all buried the lead.  Can we talk about how LeBron washes his tiny sip of wine down with a giant swig of water? || God, LeBron and Steph just need to kiss already || He's right, I think people can see the greatness in MJ and LeBron, but people want to be Steph and Allen Iverson. It's mainly the height, more relatable, and simply feels like they're defying the odds at times because of it. ||  Skyfucker || Lebron and Steph need to team up already just so we can see how good they are despite being old and imagine them in their primes together¬† || That was the single most likable 5 minutes of LeBron I've ever watched. I hated it. || What a privilege it was to watch the Steph Curry era. || In another universe Lebron joined Golden State in 2014 and 10 years later is the consensus greatest player of all time. || The humility for Lebron James to say another player has been more impactful to the game is saying something.. || AI was a rookie when I saw him in Indy. He got 3 guards in foul trouble in the first half with about 2 minutes to go.

I was wondering who was going to take him and the next thing I know, Reggie is squared up near halfcourt.

The place started to laugh and couldn't wait to see how many bones Reggie would break on the first crossover.

You could not stay in front of him. || ""6'3"", small of stature""

I'm sobbing while I stretch to reach the top cabinet || I knew Lebron was a basketball genius but this episode really showed how he processes at a different level || For sure || He covers it now too? || Only 2 players since the old old days changed the way the other teams played against them solely because they were so good at their job. Shaq and steph. They really do deserve a special spot in the hall. || So many comments about AI‚Äôs influence‚Ä¶.Some talking about basketball some talking about non-basketball influence. So many overlooking his biggest influence on the game: his crossover. || Everybody back in the day on the playground thought they had a crossover like Allen iverson ü§£",2024-03-19
"[Post Game Thread] The United States hold on and narrowly defeat South Sudan, 101-100 behind LeBron James' 23 pts",[Box score](https://www.usab.com/gamecast/1875) (should update soon),"This game far exceeded expectations on entertainment value || Nobody will ever take away from me the Carlik Jones game || USA: ‚ÄúYou were magnificent South Sudan. I‚Äôll never forget you for as long as I live‚Äù || South Sudan I apologize, I wasn't familiar with your game || You have to give all the credit in the world to Royal Ivey, Luol Deng and the entire South Sudanese team. Just an incredible performance going toe to toe with the US.

The state of the game on a global level is the best it‚Äôs ever been || I've seen Lebron go like that to the rim to end playoffs games 70 times... But South Sudan weren't ready.. || LeBron having to carry Team USA at 40 years old is wild stuff. || Give Carlik an NBA contract today || Jrue and Bron saved this game for em || Oh my sweet prince Wenyen, so close || Jones had Jrue beat and didn‚Äôt even graze rim. Then the weakside putback was disrupted because both guys jumped. What an ending, what a game. || How much flak would the team get for losing to South Sudan? Just curious lol. || I'm surprised a country with massive political turmoil managed to field an Olympic basketball team. And then there's South Sudan || Nice seeing all the love the players are showing each other after the game || Seeing lebron still do this after all this time just brings comfort to me lol. Everything else is rapidly changing, but for a couple hours every other day I can still sit down and watch Lebron cook like I was in grade 5 again. || L√®Bron!! || Stand proud South Sudan. You fought well || LeBron not beating the ""best player in the world"" allegations || That was fun as hell || That‚Äôs a guaranteed foul in the NBA. Love FIBA letting grown men play ball.
