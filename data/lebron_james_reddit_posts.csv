"LeBron James in 2017 on Charles Barkley: ""He's a hater. What makes what he says credible? Because he's on TV? I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that. I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas.""","Barkley & LeBron have had some history.

In 2016, after the Finals win over the 73-9 Warriors, Charles Barkley said James would ""never"" ascend to top-five status in NBA history over Michael Jordan, Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain. Also said that he hadn't surpassed Kobe and Duncan yet. [Source](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/10/20/lebron-james-charles-barkley-all-time-top-five) 

Then in 2017, LeBron controversially said publicly that the Cavaliers need to acquire another playmaker. Barkley didn't hold back in his response:

> ""Inappropriate. Whiny. All of the above,"" Barkley said of James last week. ""The Cleveland Cavaliers, they have given him everything he wanted. They have the highest payroll in NBA history. He wanted J.R. Smith last summer, they paid him. He wanted [Iman] Shumpert last summer. They brought in Kyle Korver. He's the best player in the world. Does he want all of the good players? He don't want to compete? He is an amazing player. They're the defending champs.""

LeBron was asked about these comments and boy, it seemed like he was waiting for a chance to let it out.

> He's a hater. What makes what he says credible? Because he's on TV?

> I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that. I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas. I never said, 'I'm not a role model.' I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying.

> All I've done for my entire career is represent the NBA the right way. Fourteen years, never got in trouble. Respected the game. Print that.

LeBron's friendships with other players in the league (namely Wade, Paul, Carmelo) were also called into question. He responded:

> Go watch the '93 Finals when John Paxson hit the shot. Barkley and Jordan were laughing and joking with each other during one of the games while somebody's shooting a free throw. In the Finals. But, oh, nobody were friends back then.

Finally, he issued a challenge to Chuck.

> And if this makes him want to talk to me, the schedule's out there. He knows every road arena I'll be in. Don't just come up to me at All-Star and shake my hand and smile.

In the Finals, they were going up against a Warriors team with 4 Hall of Famers. They needed all the help they could get. And fwiw, getting JR and Imam was a good move. I don‚Äôt know why Chuck feels the need to bring that up as if bringing them in reflects poorly on Lebron for requesting them.\n\nQuite frankly, it‚Äôs hard to describe Barkley‚Äôs behavior at that time as anything but hating.

>On Aug. 2, the Lakers can offer Doncic a four-year, $229 million extension. Doncic could also opt to sign a three-year, $165 million extension with a player option in 2028, according to ESPN NBA front office insider Bobby Marks, which would then allow him to sign a max deal in 2028 that would give him 35% of the salary cap for five seasons.

>Sources close to Doncic say he will take his time with his decision, even though he told ESPN's Malika Andrews before the playoffs that he wants to stay in Los Angeles.

>Doncic was publicly and privately heartbroken by the trade to the Lakers. He'd said he wanted to retire in Dallas. But there is a silver lining to be found, a balm to heal the wounds of a defeat that raises more questions than answers.

>""For Luka,"" a source close to Doncic told ESPN, ""he's kind of like, 'I'm wanted here.'""

>James made a concerted effort to empower Doncic since he arrived in L.A., sources said, and will not try to sway his teammate's decision.

>**""No, that ain't my job,"" James told ESPN. ""I think ... I don't think, I know, Luka knows how I feel about him. And ultimately, that trade happened for the future. That's not for me.
