LeBron James,LeBron James,2024-10-26,nbadiscussion,1gdieq7,[OC] Shot Selection & Efficiency in the Playoffs,"Playoff basketball in the NBA is a different beast. Teams face off repeatedly, allowing for instrumental coaching adjustments. Only the league's best teams play, leading to more competitive games. There are countless avenues to explore comparing playoff to regular season basketball. In this analysis, I’ll focus on just one: shot selection.

I've adapted this write-up from Substack and hopefully you can enjoy it as intended here. I don't make any money off of you visiting links, as it's purely for fun! Links to sections with image and sortable charts, not necessary but for those who are interested:

**Changes in Scoring due to Shot Location**

The two ways to improve shooting efficiency are to improve shooting percentage or take higher-quality shots. Improvements in shooting percentage are relatively easy to quantify. Assessing the quality of a shot is a bit trickier[1](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-1-150589896). In this analysis, I focus on the impact of shot selection[2](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-2-150589896) on points per shot.

Consider three different points-per-shot metrics:[3](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-3-150589896)

* Regular-Season (RS locations, RS Shooting %)
* Playoffs (Playoff locations, Playoff Shooting %)
* Expected Playoffs (Playoff locations, RS Shooting %)

Regular season and playoffs are true points-per-shot values. The expected playoffs metric shows what points per shot would be if players had maintained their regular season shooting percentages. By comparing the three metrics, you can calculate changes in points per shot due to shot location vs other factors (non-shot location).

When investigating the points per shot table, one thing stands out: change in scoring, due to shot location change, is very close to zero. At the median, different shot locations only account for 10% of the change in scoring. This supports the idea that most players are **not** taking a different mix of shots in the playoffs.

**Key Examples**

If shot location isn’t the driving factor for changes in playoff scoring, what is?

**Alec Burks (DET & NYK): +0.473 points per shot**

Alec Burks is a great example of both offensive scheme and volume. Last year, he played 43 games in Detroit, before being sent to the Knicks. In Detroit, Burks was a key contributor on offense[5](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-5-150589896). In New York, he was more of a role player, with less scoring responsibility.

In the playoffs with the Knicks, Burks took a shot every 2.4 minutes. This compares to the regular season where he took a shot every 2.1 minutes[6](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-6-150589896). Although this 20-second difference may not seem like a lot, Burks benefited in two major ways from playing with better teammates.

First, Burks could get more open looks on the Knicks due to his teammates garnering more defensive attention. Second, Burks’ role with the Knicks had less of a scoring focus. As a role player, he could focus on getting quality looks and let his talented teammates share the scoring burden. This might explain why he took fewer shots per minute.

**Jalen Suggs (ORL): -0.180 points per shot**

Suggs is a great example because although he shot from roughly the same locations, his points per shot decreased. This can be attributed to better defense or worse shooting percentage. I’m going to make the case that both are at play here.

Defense undoubtedly goes up a notch in the playoffs, with more talent and higher intensity. This might help explain Suggs’ dip in scoring efficiency.

The other prominent factor with Suggs is inexperience in the playoffs. 2024 was Suggs’ first-ever playoff series[7](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-7-150589896), and [playoff experience does matter](https://bestballstats.com/2024/02/19/predicting-nba-playoff-series-does-experience-matter/)[8](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-8-150589896). Be it nerves, unfamiliar pressure, or anything else, this may contribute to the slightly worse scoring efficiency.

**Changes in Shot Selection**

Next, I am interested in changes in shot selection from the regular season to the playoffs. To do this, I cluster[9](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-9-150589896) players based on shot location, irrespective of shot outcome. I cluster with three observations for each player:

* ***Regular season 1*** (all games)
* ***Regular season 2*** (against playoff teams)
* ***Playoffs***

I am interested in players who appear in the same cluster for Regular season 1 and Regular season 2, but in a different cluster for Playoffs. By including two regular season observations, I can control for defensive skill[10](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-10-150589896).

Shot distribution chart by location for each cluster are found at [this link for those who are interested](https://statsurge.substack.com/i/150589896/changes-in-shot-selection).

  
When investigating the above chart, some natural groupings appear. Think of these as areas of *general areas of focus* for a player, compared to their peers:

* Restricted area (Cluster 0)
* Above the break 3s (Cluster 1)
* Corner 3s (Cluster 2)
* Midrange & Paint (Cluster 3)

Out of the 86 players in the data, 18 (25%) were identified as having different shot locations in the playoffs[11](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-11-150589896) :

**Benefits of Changing Shot Selection**

In game theory, a common occurrence is a Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium (MSNE). MSNE is where players randomize their strategies, to maximize their payoff when playing against an opponent[12](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-12-150589896). I believe that in basketball, shot selection is an MSNE. Players are incentivized to take shots from different locations on the court. This keeps the defense guessing and maximizes the shooter’s expected payoff[13](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-13-150589896).

I also believe that the MSNE in the playoffs can change. To illustrate this, I’ll use the example of LeBron James. LeBron switched from a more perimeter-centric player to taking more shots in the restricted area in the playoffs. Why might LeBron drive to the basket more? Consider the benefits of each style of play.

Benefits of driving to the basket:

* Less reliance on an open look
* Higher chance of free throws awarded

Benefits of perimeter play:

* Lower level of physical exertion
* Lower injury risk

Even if the two approaches yielded the same points per shot, there are advantages to employing each.

In the playoffs, it might be harder to get an open three due to the improved defensive game plan and intensity[14](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-14-150589896). Even with the same points per shot, this may decrease shots attempted, which in turn may decrease scoring. When driving to the basket, there’s also a higher likelihood of being awarded free throws.

In the regular season, teams don’t play multiple times in a row, and there is less emphasis on a specific game plan. This might let LeBron get more open looks[15](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/shot-selection-and-efficiency-in#footnote-15-150589896), increasing shooting volume (and overall points scored). Mitigating injury risk and physical exertion may also be of higher priority in the regular season. Appearing in more regular season games could outweigh the extra benefit of getting to the free-throw line.

**Practical Applications & Next Steps**

The biggest benefit of this approach is the framework for understanding where changes in shooting are coming from. Using this framework, with a few additions, one could build a great model for predicting changes in shooting efficiency. This would be a great addition to any team’s player evaluation process.

Incorporating player tracking data is a clear next step. Quantifying close-outs, contests, defensive rotations, and defensive intensity would be great additions. Eventually, instead of just two terms (location and non-location), a model could include 4 or 5 terms with each including a specific cause for change. There could also be an error term. You could assess the quality of this model by comparing this error term to the player’s [volatility in shooting](https://statsurge.substack.com/p/the-most-consistent-3-point-shooters), and calibrate it accordingly.

I don't make any money off of this and it's purely for fun. If you have ideas for future projects I'd love to hear those too! || [deleted] || Overall I think teams look at their opponents in the regular season, and even if they have a scheme which they think will greatly hamper what the other team is doing offensively they don't employ it, at least not fully. This would be a smart approach because winning a regular season game is not close to the same value as a play off one, and if you need to maximize every game in the regular season to make the playoffs you don't have any playoff hope anyway. The other side of the floor is probably the same, ie a team might have a strategy to maximize offensive output by abusing a weakness in the opposing defensive scheme, but it's not going to be fully employed in regular season games.

The consequences of that is that the playoffs much more rewards offensive versatility, if your whole offensive game plan is centered around something which can be game planned against you'll struggle. We see this every year, I think it was very obvious in the west this year where there was a lot of upsets because vulnerabilities got exploited very hard. Bucks for example was also very impacted by this for a lot of seasons when they finished at the top of the east, yet couldn't get all the way in the playoffs, where teams made much more of an effort to take away Giannis access to the rim. It wasn't until Giannis become a much better passer they went all the way to punish such a strategy.

Haven't heard about MSNE before but I for sure agree about the premise, and that's true in both the regular season & playoffs, but gets magnified in the playoffs. It's the same in fighting games, which I think is pretty similar to bball on a strategical level. Essentially you put your opponent in a mixup where you have multiple choices of attack, in a fighting game that means one player has a frame advantage which puts the other in a defensive position, he has to guess which of the option the other player is going for. There's levels to it with different risk vs reward, and there's deep mind games where you try to get into each others head where you shouldn't always pick the best option due to it. In bball we see this all the time & high level offensive players with diverse games is essentially all about these mind games & mixups.

Take Luka for example, he has one of the most diverse set of tools in the league when coming off a screen at the top of the key, it's the bread & butter of the offense. The defense is put in a mixup when he goes through the screen, by forcing the defender to go either over or under he'll either have to give up an attempt at a 3 or giving up space to attack the rim, at which point he'll create more mixups, is he going to attack the rim, try to find the lob, or kick it out? Essentially he's forcing the defense to pick what they're willing to give up, which usually leads to a high percentage attempt. The huge difference between fighting games & bball however is that variance in makes from game to game. For example, if Luka in this case has a poor shooting night the defense can adapt to give up more attempts from 3 & suddenly his ability to impose his game on the opponents are significantly hampered. I think fans often fail to realize this when watching games, he's 1/5 from 3, why is he still shooting 3s? Pretty much because he has to, if he stops shooting he's giving up on that initial mixup & suddenly the defense can just start to take away his options of going to the basket from the screen. The opposite is also true, if he's 5/5 from 3 the defense might be inclined to try & take away the 3 instead, at which point his entire game going towards the rim becomes much easier.

It feels like in the playoffs analyzing all these mixups are a much larger thing, and it's played much harder into. The pressure on stars are much harder, the defense is playing harder on them, and if a star is hot they'll commit much more defensive resource to try & slow them down, and then it becomes much more about other players capitalizing on the space they're now given. || I wish I had something of substance to add but this was an excellent coffee read and I'll keep an eye out for more. Love learning new concepts like the MSNE. || Thats  precisely why it's a mixed strategy. 


Of course, you'd like every play to be a layup, but the more layup you do, and the better you are at them, the more the defense will adjust to deny the layup. 


But then, adjusting to deny the layup opens up the lob or the step back. ...which in turn puts the defense in a situation where they may not commit as hard to stopping the layup. 


This is the basis of, for example, Hardens iso bag. Where he starts a drive in the same way but either randomly decides to drive or step back or reacts to the defense to take the option that is most open.

 



So, even if you don't consciously think ""I'm going to use a mixed strategy"", it ends up bring mathematically well modeled by it. No human is a random number generator, and both the offense and defense are trying to read each other, but the offenses certainly are using analytics to try and determine the optimal rate of each play based on their efficiency and how it opens up the floor for other plays. || [deleted] || It's a mixed strategy *because* the defense attempts to funnel you where they want. If the defense didn't react to the offense you'd just spam your most efficient shot 100 times in a row. || [deleted] || NBA offenses run different plays, they don't just run the same play with different reads over and over again. || [deleted] || That's a heavy exaggeration. Pnr is common, but not even the majority of plays (last time I saw the stats)"
LeBron James,LeBron James,2024-11-04,nbadiscussion,1gkmo2s,How Rafael Stone’s Plan for Phase 1 of the Houston Rockets rebuild went from what fans deemed ‘an embarrassment’ to what some analysts now view as ‘The Model’ ,"\[Ed. note: This is (part 1 of?) a very long theory. A TL;DR: is at the end, but I recommend skimming **the bold sentences** as you scroll to it if you want to catch the gist and track where the details are.\]   

One of the more impressive turnarounds in the history of the NBA occurred last season, when the Houston Rockets entered Phase 2 of their rebuild. After 3 seasons of winning an average of 20 games, they nearly doubled their win total by posting 41 wins en route to a .500 season. **I’m not going to rehash all the most obvious moves that occurred throughout Phase 1**, like General Manager Rafael Stone’s unprecedented decision to eschew the return of a young prospect when trading away James Harden, opting for unprotected picks instead, or how he loaded 10 of those first round picks over a period of a few years to align the core players’ timelines. I won’t speculate as to how much good fortune had to come for those picks to yield Tari Eason, Reed Sheppard and a bevy of future unprotected Phoenix Suns picks, or how much of a misstep it may have been to take chances on damaged goods in the form of John Wall and Victor Oladipo, and to a different extent, Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Jr. 

The purpose here is to reveal elements of the rebuild that went largely unnoticed or ignored at the time that led to the surprising boost in wins when Houston popped the clutch in the summer of 2023. Not many people foresaw such a complete reversal of fortune occurring, with pre-season expectations for win totals typically hovering in the low 30s. Most fans had long since lost hope that there was any chance at a winning season, with many just wanting to avoid the continued embarrassment of finishing with one of the worst records in the league for a 4^(th) season in a row. 

Those people apparently did not pay attention to Andy Bailey’s calculation that veteran players would add an estimated 19 wins (he was exactly right), or recognize that Stone had designed the rebuild to create this huge leap in wins. Or perhaps they had just lost faith in his ability to do it because they thought he had been trying to win games throughout Phase 1. There is a large amount of confusion regarding what exactly Stone was trying to accomplish during Phase 1 of the rebuild, as many of the largest social media accounts have been questioning whether he had an actual plan,  lambasting him as bumbling cluelessly through the rebuild, making bad decision after bad decision, but somehow stumbling into a perfect confluence of coincidence.

**I’m going to explain the key components of what I believe was a well-executed Plan, a new and improved ‘Process’ for tanking that still allows promising young prospects to get developmental reps. I ask that you weigh it along with the consideration that under no circumstances could Rafael Stone admit to taking some of the extreme steps I’ll suggest he knowingly took, both because it would result in heavy penalties from the NBA and potentially a loss of trust with some of the players. After reading, ask yourself if this interpretation of the Rockets rebuild is truly less likely than the commonly accepted alternative narratives. I believe that Stone’s radical new tanking Plan is not only replicable, but has in fact already been copied by one of the most discerning front offices in the league**. 

Before going into the details of how I believe the Plan unfolded, **let’s establish a basic fact that was ignored or denied by many Rockets fans - that the team was intentionally tanking**. Most of the bloggers and largest accounts on Rockets Twitter subscribed to the belief that the team wasn’t trying to lose… they were just bad.

Of course, Rafael Stone cannot admit to tanking the same way Sam Hinkie openly asked Philly fans to “Trust the Process”. Ever since the 76ers damaged the public perception of the league’s competitiveness standards, Silver has made it clear that any intentional tanking will be punished harshly. The Mavericks caught hell for admitting to tanking a relatively meaningless game at the end of the season to keep their pick. How would Silver react to a team stating they had planned to lose as much as possible for three consecutive seasons? A 7-figure fine would just be a starting point. It could result in the loss of the pick or Stone’s job (*insert .gif of Hinkie nodding solemnly*). But without a smoking gun from the front office saying that the tank was on, many people simply refused to admit that losing enough games to finish with a bottom-three record was an intentional franchise goal.

While this goal was obvious to most folks who followed the NBA over the second half of the 2021 season (even before John Wall called it out the following season), many fans of the franchise did not realize that similar goals were in place for the next 2 years, as well. Perhaps the biggest reason for the lack of recognition was that nobody in the Rockets front office explicitly stated they were tanking in the way that Philadelphia did; so unlike Philly fans, who found a way to cope with the losing, a lot of Houston fans had loftier expectations for their club than a bottom-3 record, and they allowed their frustration at the repeated losing to be vented off with disgust over the product they were watching. This created an avalanche of ill-will towards every level of the franchise on the X platform (particularly in the ‘Spaces’) from fans who were disappointed in the losing and confused by the product they were watching. Make no mistake, **the “embarrassment” label that was emblazoned upon Phase 1 had emerged fully formed from the fanbase years before anyone in the national media smelled the blood in the water and joined into the frenzy**. 

Although Stone had touched vaguely upon his Plan in the summer of 2022 when he stated the expectations were to deliver a huge leap in wins in the 2024 season, **Tilman Fertitta set the record straight** once and for all the following year at the groundbreaking of the new Rockets practice facility (and again more recently following its opening). With the transition to Phase 2, the Rockets’ owner couldn’t help himself, cracking the door open to let fans know **that the “painful” previous 3-years had been planned for quite some time. We learned that the team viewed 30 wins as “basketball purgatory” and saw 20 wins as desirable for drafting high-caliber talent**. Fertitta is a gambler. He understands odds better than most. He had thick enough skin to embrace 3 straight years of being horrible with the knowledge that it gave him the best odds at building a Championship contender. He certainly understood that every percentage point in the odds of drafting Wembanyama was worth millions of dollars. 

Following this statement (admission?), many fans began to revise history, pretending they were aware of this all along, but anyone paying attention to social media throughout Phase 1 probably did not see many of these accounts reminding fans that the losses were to be expected. In fact, losses were often brought up as the primary factor in complaints about the team and coaching staff (feel free to search who used the team’s record against Stephen Silas in their desire to brand him “the worst coach ever” if you want proof they didn’t recognize that losing was an institutional goal). No moment encapsulates how out of touch most of social media was with the team’s goals than their response to a loss to Miami in mid-December of 2022. The team had been playing .500 ball for a month (and was on a pace to hit 30 wins and destroy their chances at a bottom 3 seed), when they lost a game in the final second of play due to a blown coverage by Daishen Nix. 

When Rockets fans are aware the team is actively tanking (or even perceive that tanking would be a good thing under the circumstances), they are very content with close, competitive losses. One could even say they generally root for the loss and not be too far off-base. This scenario typically arises at the end of a season, because that is the traditional time for teams to tank, however, as you’ll soon see, ***Houston had been in tank mode since the pre-season***. The mid-December loss to the Heat set Rockets Twitter ablaze with fury. They had already been disappointed with a lackluster 9-18 record (for what it’s worth, a record that was 5^(th)\-worst in the league at the time), and largely unwilling to acknowledge that the franchise was looking to secure the top draft odds for Victor Wembanyama.

Fans did not recognize how difficult it was to stay within reach of a bottom-3 seed and the top draft odds that came with it. It took extreme measures. Every odd choice coming from the front office and coaching staff was necessary just to stay in the bottom 5 teams. As teams like Utah and Portland can confirm, traditional, late-season turns to tanking are insufficient if a franchise wants to get the best draft odds possible. Even with 3 teams getting equal odds at the top pick, those bottom seeds tend to separate themselves from the many teams contending for the play-in tournament. If a team doesn’t stay within reach of the bottom, they will be unable to get there once they make a shift to true ‘tank lineups’ at the end of the season**. If a team wants to guarantee good odds for the next summer’s draft, they need to make an early commitment to losing before the bottom drops out too far beneath them to catch**. Sometimes that decision is made for a team with an extended losing streak, but occasionally that decision is made before the season even starts. And that appears to be the case in (at least the third year of) Houston’s Phase 1.

Tanking is not easy to do without tipping your hand, though. **A team needs plausible deniability to avoid punishment**. It is important to remember that every player in the NBA is always trying to win the game. Philadelphia went to roster-building extremes that made it clear to everyone watching that they had no intention of winning games by playing a lot of really sub-par players, but they also benefited from their best player being too injured to play. This is how other obvious tanks have been run, recent examples include the Warriors and Thunder losing Steph and SGA for extended stretches, allowing them to get the 2^(nd) overall pick. But you cannot rely upon your best players being injured. And trying to limit their playing time is complicated. There is only so much you can realistically do as a front office. Asking an incredibly talented player to fake an injury so the team can attempt to add another valuable prospect who will threaten his status as the best player on the team is absolutely out of the question. 

Securing the top odds for Wembanyama was going to require something beyond simply hoping Jalen Green, Jabari Smith and Alperen Segun would get injured. Besides, Stone very much needed these young players to be getting reps in the NBA. None of them were the ‘generational’ level of prospect who can step into the pros on day one and contribute to winning (in large part due to their age and body type), so developing them properly to be ready when the team flipped the switch to winning the next year was of critical importance. 

How can a team play their best young players and be relatively certain of losing games? This was the question that Rafael Stone needed an answer to, and I believe he had discovered it the year before when the team was actively tanking for one of Jabari Smith Jr, Chet Holmgren, or Paolo Banchero. **The secret to tanking while letting young stars play and grow is related to the players the team puts in support of the young stars.**

Throughout the 2022 season, Rockets fans bemoaned the fact that veteran players were in the active rotation alongside top picks Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun instead of giving heavy minutes to other rookies like Josh Christopher and Usman Garuba (yes, I realize Garuba spent most of this season injured, but that didn’t stop fans from blaming Silas for not giving him enough playing time). 

While fans hopefully recognize the immense value veterans provide after adding them for Phase 2, many fans were begging to see Josh Christopher play in place of Eric Gordon during Phase 1. What these fans did not realize at the time was how important it is to have good role models on the floor who know how to play the game. The veteran players helped keep games from becoming absolute blowouts in the 2022 season. Blowout losses do not offer the same valuable learning opportunities that closer games do, because when the other team is playing 3^(rd) string players for the 2^(nd) half after their starters easily coast to a big lead, the game no longer represents standard NBA competitiveness, and consequently provides less of a true ‘learning’ experience - they are wasted minutes more representative of a G-League game than an NBA game.

Yes, **veteran players are critical in a young player’s development, but they also have a strong impact on a team's ability to win games.** However the majority of Rockets fans on Twitter felt their presence served no purpose whatsoever. That may be why they didn’t notice when the veteran players started getting systematically removed from the lineup once the team started playing well and had a stretch of games on the schedule against other bad teams to whom it would be beneficial to lose. Since they were so happy to see the young players get minutes, and wildly overrated their impact on winning NBA games, **many fans ignored the loss of value the vets provided once they were no longer in the rotation**. As the product on the court got increasingly worse, fans blamed the coach instead of recognizing that the lost value the veterans had been providing was the larger culprit.

Margins between winning and losing are thinner than ever in the NBA; particularly in this current age of parity when an immense amount of talent exists in the league. **A team does not need to go to the extreme that the Sixers did to greatly increase their odds of losing games. It isn’t critical to play entire lineups of G-Leaguers - simply having one or two developmental players in the active rotation can be enough to cripple one’s odds of winning**.

It’s no secret that one great player on a roster can have a major impact on the game. The most casual fan knows this to be true of superstars, but even a high-level rookie can have a massive impact (*insert .gif of Chet flexing*). With the current depth in the league allowing teams to put an entire rotation of quality players on the court, what has been less noticed by fans is how impactful a really bad player can be. Chris Vernon calls the idea, **“Don’t play guys that suck”**, and for as simplistic as it sounds… it’s true. **Playing bad players for serious minutes tends to result in losses**. There are exceptions to the rule, like Harden winning a ton of games when the Rockets were frequently giving minutes to G-Leaguers. But that superstar level of play is what it takes to overcome a sub-par rotation and reliably win games. Anyone who follows the league should recognize that teenagers don’t typically play like superstars consistently, but that was what the young Rockets prospects were required to do to win games with their misfit supporting cast.

Typically, when a team undergoes a rebuild, they maintain a veteran presence in the locker room to help mentor the younger players. These veterans also serve as an extension of the coach on the floor, providing accountability and a level of structure and reliability on the court that can translate to a better environment for ‘winning basketball’ than a rotation full of 1^(st) and 2^(nd) year players. Occasionally, one of these supporting veteran role players can even have a hot night and play a big part in delivering a win. 

But what if a team has no interest in winning games? **I strongly feel that Stone’s expulsion of veteran guidance was extreme, targeted, and for the express purpose of losing.** One example of this, John Wall, is well-known. It would seem obvious that removing a former multi-time All-Star and replacing him with a troubled kid carrying emotional baggage and a well-documented history of selfishness wouldn’t be a ‘win-now’ move. But after an off-night from Jrue Holiday in the dog days of the 2021 season resulted in a flukey 51-point outburst from Kevin Porter Jr., the Rockets fanbase somehow convinced themselves that it was an upgrade. The same delusion existed the following year when Christian Wood was dismissed to make room for a teenage draft pick. But even if someone wants to squint very hard and pretend these moves were ‘addition by subtraction’, it’s hard to make the same argument when the players being inserted into the rotation are late-round draft picks or undrafted players from the G-League. And yet Rockets fans, thinking Josh Christopher was Jrue Holiday 2.0, still **found a way to ignore when vets like Daniel Theis and DJ Augustin were taken out of the rotation weeks before the 2022 trade deadline with no injuries to excuse their absence**.

These were quality veteran role players who did their job just a little too well, Theis managed to keep the worst defense in the league just below average while he was playing at the beginning of the 2022 season, and Augustin provided very competent play as a backup point guard, winning a game against Atlanta practically single handedly. **It’s odd to me that Silas would choose to play rookies over these veterans if he were primarily interested in winning games, as the narratives pushed by Rockets social media professed. I feel it’s far more likely that he and Stone were working together to handicap the roster. I’ve frequently equated it to trying to dunk in Timberlands, or swimming with a medicine ball… the team’s potential upside was shackled with a sub-par level of support that dragged down the young stars’ performances**. It’s no different from the standard ‘developmental’ lineups teams traditionally run at the end of the season, removing veterans for G-Leaguers, expanding the rotation to 11 or 12 men… heck, they even tried to bench their best player. Unfortunately, Rockets fans thought the G-Leaguers were budding stars, so they couldn’t recognize the tank was on. Even with Silas proclaiming the rotations were “experimental” and temporary. Which they were. By March, 2023 (coincidentally right after Charlotte went on a 5-game winning streak that locked up a bottom-3 record for Houston), the Rockets finally started running consistent, 9-man rotations for the first time. They went 9-11 over the last 20 games, including big wins over both Finals teams (and no, neither Denver and Boston were taking it easy, both teams were healthy and in tight seeding battles). I suspect this is much closer to what the team would have looked like had Silas used normal rotations all season long, resulting in 30-something wins; a range we now know was considered “purgatory” by management. 

**It seems clear to me that Silas was almost certainly making lineup decisions based on the front office’s wishes**. In a local radio interview following Chris Mannix’s foray into questioning why John Wall wasn’t playing, Silas revealed that it was Stone who wanted KPJ to play point guard and that Fertitta had paid John to go away so the young guards learn by making mistakes (please remember this, there will be more on this point to come when we talk about development). Fans long felt that Silas played KPJ because he was enamored by him, but this interview revealed how incorrect that assumption was. As much potential as Kevin Porter Jr. may have displayed, Silas surely recognized there was no precedent for him running the point. Quite the opposite, he had a reputation as a renowned black hole. Why would a front office with a plan to lose games want a guy like this to run the offense instead of a veteran or one of their young draft picks? It honestly seems so obvious that it’s hard to believe someone couldn’t see the likely truth - that **KPJ was a hand-selected tank commander**. However, thanks to their irrational confidence in him, a huge portion of Rockets fans embraced the idea that KPJ was the face of the franchise alongside Jalen. Of course, there is zero chance that the Rockets front office is going to publicly correct this line of thought. They will never come out and say, “We don’t think Kevin is our starting point guard of the future, but we’re going to give him the ball.” There is no benefit in saying it, and a boatload of potential harm from admitting it. So when a large number of fans embraced KPJ, it provided the perfect cover to continue putting the keys to the offense in the hands of one of the least-qualified players to run it. Additionally, it allowed Stone the chance to try to polish an uncut diamond in the rough with the hopes of turning a top-55 protected second-round pick into an actual, rotation-caliber player if things went well (*sidenote: KPJ’s transformation was actually pretty remarkable, in my opinion. As someone who never expected much out of him, I do think he grew into a decent rotation player, as I suspect we will see this season in LA*). 

**As soon as Phase 2 began, it became clear that the Plan had almost certainly never been to give KPJ the keys to the franchise when it was winning time, as he was replaced with a veteran point guard immediately following the start of free agency**. We now know that the years-long rumor of Stone pursuing a reunion with James Harden was true. Udoka may have chosen Fred VanVleet over Harden, but the underlying play was the same – spend big money in free agency to upgrade the point guard position. Remember how much of an effect one player can have on the game? Well, that effect is amplified if that player has the most important role in the offense… running the point.

From a front office standpoint, I have to believe that **not only did Stone recognize the importance of the point guard on the offense, but that he had chosen to short this position in order to weaken the overall product**. Point guard is arguably the deepest position in the NBA, and there are always decent players available (*insert .gif of Tyus Jones clapping enthusiastically*). It would have been exceedingly easy to get a competent veteran point guard to sit on the bench in lieu of Boban (*Side note: Maintaining good vibes throughout Phase 1 was obviously a big concern for Stone, and despite fans’ attempts to tear the locker room apart with their body language policing, it’s been very apparent in hindsight that the team chemistry was top-notch, something Stone strongly defends. While he may not have provided much practical advice, Boban certainly helped keep spirits high despite the losing. Silas was another aspect of these good vibes. His easy-going demeanor was a far better choice than getting an ‘accountability’ coach to scream at guys about playing losing basketball when the entire plan was literally to play losing basketball.*); even something as simple as bringing back Schroder or Augustin provided a huge upgrade to the team’s odds of winning games.  

But a tank cannot be allowed to be derailed by a veteran with an axe to grind. Not when Daishen Nix exists. Stone raised eyebrows when he said he thought of Nix as a ‘lottery-level talent’. While some fans eagerly heightened their expectations for the team with the hope that Nix was going to be a quality addition, **I feel it is fair to question if Stone really believed that the primary backup point guard had game-changing talent** (at least, of the positive variety). If he did believe that, it certainly doesn’t explain why Nix was unceremoniously dismissed as soon as Phase 1 ended. If he wasn’t in the future plans, Nix could have been waived at any point in time during the 2023 season. Unless, of course, **Stone** ***wanted*** **Nix to be playing the backup point guard minutes**. It’s very interesting to me that the ‘mandatory Nix minutes’ ceased immediately following Silas’s emotional breakdown that led to his only ejection during his tenure. At that same moment he stopped running 3-centers (opening up more playing time for his best player) as his lineups reverted from the experimental 11 or 12-man platoons back to the standard 9 or 10-man rotations that basically every coach has run for time immemorial, including Silas himself when he first came to Houston. With Silas blaming fan pressure as one of the factors in his nervous breakdown, I can’t help but wonder if Stone finally took the handcuffs off as he took pity on the mental state these “experimental” lineups had left his good friend in.

It is well-documented that Stone and Silas spoke on a daily basis, with Stone giving advice to both his coach and players. Is it really easier to believe that Silas stubbornly ignored all of Stone’s advice and was “experimenting” with 11-man rotations because he was trying hard to win and had apparently had the revelation that playing more rookies and G-Leaguers was the best path to wins, ***or*** that Silas was trying to make his boss and friend happy by running lineups that helped to achieve the institutional goal of winning closer to 20 games than 30? It doesn’t even require a direct order from Stone to make this a likely option. Simply commenting about how much it would help to expand the rotation and play more than the top 7 or 8 guys (*wink-wink, nudge-nudge, know what I mean?*) would be more than enough to explain why Silas would do something that is clearly anathema to putting the most competitive rotation possible on the court. Anyone who has ever been in a successful relationship recognizes the importance of keeping one’s partner happy, and Stone and Silas were clearly partners in choosing how the team would look and play. To me it was obvious that the team had embarked upon a path of preemptive tanking in order to avoid starting the season hot and then being unable to land in the bottom 3 teams, or in other words, what happened to the Jazz. What should have tipped fans off was when Alperen Sengun got benched for Bruno Fernando right after he dismantled the Spurs in the first preseason game. 

Earlier in the summer, Silas had declared Sengun the starting center, speaking of how much he loved the playmaking AlP brought to the position. There was no reason for Silas to reverse course on his statement and bench Sengun after his success against the Spurs if his primary goal was winning. The Rockets have one of the best advanced stats departments in the association, one which would have surely alerted Stone and Silas of AlP’s positive impact if their eyes had somehow fallen out of their heads and they completely missed it, the way fans often pretend. The front office seemed to be well aware of how important he was at the end of the 2022 season, when they held him out of two must-lose games against Sacramento. **But Rockets fans did not recognize that benching the Alperen Sengun for Bruno Fernando was likely a tanking move, because they did not recognize Sengun was by far the most positively impactful player on the team, and thus the player most in need of having his minutes and role limited**. Almost nobody in the Rockets fanbase believed Sengun was a cornerstone player prior to the 2023 draft. I know this because I begged them to consider him as such, yet got almost nobody to cosign the idea. Fans felt that Silas hated AlP because he held Sengun accountable for his lack of defense and seemed annoyed when questioned about it. My theory is that AlP needed to improve his defense anyway, so it was a good year to develop those skills (which he did, to the point that everyone on the team raved about his improvement in March 2023), and that Silas’s visible annoyance was not due to AlP, with whom he had a good relationship, but from repeatedly getting questions about something that was so obviously a tanking move, but that he was unable to openly confirm. 

A vocal portion of fans felt Silas hated Sengun and didn’t want to run the offense through him. AlP quashed those narratives in an interview for Turkish TV in which he said he had a great relationship with Silas, who he felt was misunderstood by fans, and that Silas had trained him to run the point. This should have been obvious to fans in 2021, had they not been solely focused on why Silas wasn’t staggering KPJ and Jalen. The answer was obvious. The young guards froze Sengun out of the offense when they shared the floor. Not staggering them was the only way to get AlP reps running the bench units. Many fans seem to think Silas hated Sengun and refused to play through him because of a slavish devotion to a specific guard-centric style of play. These fans clearly had blocked the Christian Wood experience from their minds. When Wood was available, offense frequently ran through him. 

Silas’s ‘random offense’ asked the players to read the defense and react to it. Dubbed “Everybody eats” by the team, it was a version of the Warriors offense, ideal for the modern NBA. The problem being that such an offense requires a lot of experience, BBIQ and chemistry for teams to run it effectively, and the young Rockets had none of that. Developing the young talent was Silas’s primary goal, so what better way than getting a head start on learning an optimal offense for a group composed of multiple guys who could be top options? Running specific plays to feature one guy doesn’t help develop everyone on the team and actually doesn’t even really develop that player. It just makes him look good. Learning how to spam one skill is not as useful as learning when to do what for oneself without being instructed. Many of the largest accounts on Rockets Twitter refused to understand this. They complained incessantly that guys were not being put in optimal positions by running ideal plays, not recognizing that the chaos they were watching was actually not only better for development, but also aiding the team in delivering the losses they didn’t believe were the goal of Phase 1. 

**Asking guys to just play their games and giving them the freedom to make decisions in the moment will frequently result in mistakes, but the internalized, organic learning that comes from that is an optimal way to increase the players’ overall feel for the game.** Richard Jefferson defended Silas’s methods as being a great way to increase a player’s BBIQ, something that Jabari Smith Jr. and KJ Martin both pointed to as personal areas of growth under Silas. Jabari was also grateful for the support and confidence Silas gave him when he was suffering through a horrific shooting slump. That freedom to make mistakes without getting benched allowed Jabari the necessary reps to get right. Over the last quarter of the 2023 season he actually had better stats than he did in year one under Udoka, which is when most people believe he made a ‘leap’; but the truth is that the improvement had been incremental and on full display throughout his rookie season. 

\[*Ed. note: This piece is evolving into a defense of Silas and his methods. While the rebuild and its coach are inextricably linked, that is not the purpose here and would require several thousand more words, a timeline of relevant details, and a significant amount of statistical supporting evidence to show exactly how well the young core developed under Silas. As this is getting quite long already, such a defense is better saved for a later installment. But there is good reason to point out one more major point in the defense of the developmental methods that Silas used, and it’s not that these methods were good enough for LeBron James, Steph Curry, and Luka Doncic, but instead reflects upon how one of the greatest coaching figures in the game viewed SIlas’s methods.*\]

When **Gregg Popovich** was questioned about Houston’s process, he praised it, and **admired Silas’s patience and refusal to skip steps**. “Patience” is an interesting word for Pop to use. He seems to have found it commendable that Silas *wasn’t* tearing into the young players when they screwed up. This makes sense to anyone who has worked with a learning-via-mistakes system. When embracing mistakes as learning opportunities, a strict structure of accountability is not practical. Why would someone punish a learner for making the mistakes that are literally the basis of their education? Most of the time, a guy already recognizes when he has screwed up, and being disciplined in front of millions of viewers may not be the most effective strategy for getting all teenagers to do better. A primary concern for learners is demotivation, and getting consistently yelled at while losing may provide a quick path to accomplishing those unfortunate ends. Especially when it is obvious to everyone that the team has not been built to prioritize winning, it seems odd to focus on delivering accountability for not playing ‘winning basketball’. For an infamous disciplinarian like Popovich, it seems strange to think he might not look for every opportunity to yell at a player!    

But the greatest praise would come the following year when Pop’s 2024 season had many media members and fans questioning if he had gone soft and lost a step in his old age. 

There is a saying that “imitation is the sincerest form of flattery…”

Remember at the start of this tome when I stated I believed Stone’s Plan had already been copied by another team? Enter the San Antonio Spurs. I do not follow that team with the same level of intensity with which I watch Rockets games and media coverage, but I absolutely noticed the parallels as **the Spurs appeared to run Stone’s Plan in their rebuilding process**. The Spurs’ season began with wonky rotations that often ran much deeper than expected and featured developmental players and guys playing out of position. Wembanyama’s minutes were limited and his best skill (rim defense) was not properly utilized. The offense was run by Jeremy Sochan, a wing who had never played the point before, prompting Bill SImmons to say the whole situation felt a little “stealth-tanky”. Fans saw the chaos and lack of accountability and assumed Pop had lost a lot of his bark as well as his bite as the Spurs struggled mightily out of the gate, helping to stake an early claim as one of the worst teams in the league. But as the season progressed, all these ‘flaws’ were systematically repaired and the team ended the season on a much stronger note, more representative of their actual position in the league’s hierarchy. This late-season success provided a great amount of positive vibes heading into an offseason in which key veterans were added. The Spurs, with arguably the best coach of all time, the best prospect of all time, and a supporting cast significantly better than the Rockets had in 2023, managed to scratch out the same 22 wins that Houston had produced the year before, securing a high-quality Robin for their Batman. Do not be surprised if all the national media members who feel Pop is washed (looking at you, Nate Duncan) get a rude awakening this season as he returns to running more practical rotations and plays and showing a general interest in winning games that he had clearly softened his stance on last season. The Spurs are a lock to win 35 games in my opinion, and could potentially push this number into the 40s if they get the same quality of play from CP3 and Barnes that Houston got from FVV and Brooks (I don’t honestly expect this to happen, though, although they are better players, they are also significantly older and unlikely to hold up to a similar minutes load)

So let’s try to wrap this up for now with a **TL;DR:**

**I believe Rafael Stone designed a new method of 'preemptive tanking', designed around running bad lineups at the beginning of the season rather than the end to assure good draft odds while still allowing the team to finish the season on a strong note, bringing positive vibes into the offseason. By removing the veterans and competent point guard play, he knew that the only way the team he built would win was if the young stars turned in superstar level performances. The acceptance of mistakes was a part of the process, and not something to be punished, because those mistakes were both learning opportunities and important for the end goal of getting a high draft pick. The Spurs noticed this process and copied it because it is effective at developing young players while losing games.**

Closing commentary:

Phase 1 of the Rockets rebuild was deemed embarrassing by fans who didn’t recognize the team was actively tanking for draft odds and who complained about not seeing development in particular areas (most specifically team defense and accountability) while willfully ignoring obvious improvements in other areas. But the actual process of Phase 1 successfully resulted in attaining the team’s primary objectives… getting the best draft odds possible while preparing the squad to play ‘winning ball’ as soon as veterans were added for Phase 2.

TIlman Fertitta confirmed the Rockets planned to tank for 3 years. Rafael Stone benched John Wall for Jae’Sean Tate so Kevin Porter Jr could learn to run an NBA offense by making mistakes (It’s also worth acknowledging that Wall was dismissed from the team facilities right after delivering a healthy dose of accountability to the young guards). These are facts about Stone’s Plan that Rockets Twitter refused to recognize. Had they understood the assignment, they may have viewed the product differently.

Their current narrative would have you believe that Stone built a team with the intent to win 30ish games in the year the best prospect since LeBron was entering the draft. Stone saw that his good friend was making numerous questionable decisions for over 2 years, and instead of correcting those choices, chose to ride it out because if the team’s poor shooting continued, it might help them achieve better draft odds. Furthermore, instead of internally promoting G-League-Championship-winning coach, Mahmoud Abdelfattah, who was famous for his strong voice and accountability (literally the top 2 qualities ownership sought in the new coach hire), Stone kept Silas in the head coach role for the entire season because nobody wanted to fire him after his dad died… even though Silas had been running rotations for months prior to that which indicated he had forgotten everything he had ever learned about basketball… were he actually trying his hardest to win games (because of course he was; there was zero chance he was aware of any plan to tank for Wembanyama or willing to aid his boss in achieving it). 

I submit as an alternative theory that Rafael Stone identified that removing vocal veteran players from the team and the ‘accountability’ they inherently provide, and running expanded rotations featuring multiple developmental players and sub-par point guards in an environment where very young players were free to explore their games without being punished for playing ‘losing basketball’ would sufficiently handicap the team as to where they could stealthily tank their way to a bad record. And that he was well aware that one could easily add veterans, game management, quality point guard play and accountability once winning became a priority, resulting in the huge leap in wins in 2024 that he had announced as a franchise goal in the summer of 2022.",104,33,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1gkmo2s/how_rafael_stones_plan_for_phase_1_of_the_houston/,2024-11-05 20:09:23,"I don't intend to read all that though I'm sure it is good.

I just don't see how it was ever considered an embarrassment by anyone other than casual fans and the media for casual fans?

They got a good return on russ that was washed, good return on harden, good return on basically every player they've dealt. Really only the oladipo move was a negative one.

Despite Jalen Greens struggles they got Sengun in that class, Jabari hasn't been great but they got Tari Eason, last year they got 2 players who were considered top 5 talents as well.

Part of it is they have certainly had luck keeping their picks and jumping in the lottery but it has always been a well run rebuild. Certainly there were moments where Jalen was struggling and mobley looked like a generational player where it looked like they made the wrong pick at 2, but their decisions have all been B+ or better aside from him really.

I mean they got fucked by Lopez but it didn't really cost them any material assets either. They have loads of expendable salary and none of it bad should they want to make a trade || Ok so is your argument they basically figured a way to tank that seemed less obvious?  Cause I feel like it still was obvious. Just plausible deniability?

And at the end of the day, in my mind, they still don’t have a single all star.  Possibly Sengun, but isn’t he Sabonis at best?  A nice player but flawed & inevitably the best player on a play-in team?

I guess i don’t see the profundity here.  A little less obvious tank but they fucked it up because they still don’t have top end talent.  And let me add a caveat because i do not know much about this year’s draft class. || Suppose that instead of KPJ, Jalen was the featured focal point of the offense. How do you think this would have impacted his development, team success in years 2021-2024, and overall odds at getting good draft picks used to draft Jabari, Amen, and most recently Reed Shepard? || what a brilliant piece of writing and analysis, tysm for the education on a team I hadn't paid attention to in some time

Me neither. But Rockets Twitter is hypothetically full of non-casuals, and if you paid attention to it during the rebuild, you would have seen very few accounts acknowledging that Phase 1 was going well. Even the largest accounts (who one would presume have a healthy amount of knowledge about basketball) were expecting more ""winning basketball"" and furious over the product they were viewing.

>they have certainly had luck keeping their picks and jumping in the lottery

Minor point of order, that Houston's pick never actually jumped in the lottery (only the BKN pick did). A lot of fans bemoaned Houston's lottery luck. || That said I do agree with your take on surrounding young talent with vets.  As a Wolves fan I do think that its a big difference on why KAT never developed (and to a lesser extent Wiggins, tho i doubt anyone was fixing his motor) and why Ant is developing so fast. 

Ultimately tho they bet on the wrong young guys imo. || >Cause I feel like it still was obvious

You and me both. Trust me when I say the BlogBois in the Rockets fanbase did not see it and have built an entire narrative around 'alternative facts' (often proven incorrect over time) that the team was trying its hardest to win. The primary purpose of this document is to provide what I believe to be a more accurate accounting of the actual steps taken in the rebuild.

>they fucked it up because they still don’t have top end talent.

I think it's too soon to say this. Other than Amen Thompson and Tari Eason (both of whom look like they have All-Defense talent), all their picks were amongst the youngest in their draft classes. They came into the league scrawny, but are visibly improving as they add muscle to their frames. AlP is tracking to be better than Sabonis by the metrics. Even if he is the best prospect long-term (I don't believe he is), an All-Star surrounded by multiple All-Defense talent and shooters who aren't negatives on defense is a contender in today's league. The NBA has changed, making depth of top-end talent incredibly important. Teams like CLE & NYK are showing paths to winning without a superstar, while teams like DEN, MIL & LAL are proving that just having the best player on the floor isn't necessarily sufficient anymore.

But the more important point to make here is that they haven't tasked their young talent with the workload or responsibility of a superstar, yet, which I believe is the primary reason folks who don't follow the team closely don't recognize just how talented some of the guys are.

The over-reliance on KPJ (and now FVV) hasnt given their true talent the raw touches required to show how much they are capable of. || Reed Sheppard's status would obviously have been unaffected as he was a result of the Nets trade.

But I do believe that Jalen Green is a better player than KPJ, and that giving him the ball more often would have yielded better results. || Jalen was a close 2nd in USG% on the Rockets in his Rookie year, and outright 1st in USG% in his 2nd and 3rd seasons. He's pretty much been the focal point of the offense, for better or worse, since he came into the league. || Thank you for the kind words! || I forgot to link this when I wrote the post...

It's not in-depth analysis, I was just trying to reach the many, many Rockets fans on X who claimed Houston wasn't tanking by design... That they were just a bad team.

But if you know who the Beastie Boys are, you may get a kick out of it. || Sam Presti's model for this recent rebuild was to take advantage of new, desperate owners.

I'm not sure how sustainable that is. Taking advantage of a new owner's impatience can only happen in certain circumstances.

He did also get lucky to have his best player get injured at the right time (not to mention moving up in the lottery, something Houston's pick never did, fwiw), and while one can argue that is more replicable... Is it really? You can force a guy to sit out, but not all of them will willingly acquiesce without hard feelings that could impact the team's future relationship with that player. || We removed your comment for being low effort whining. || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || Yet in hindsight, we know that they were developing fine by being given that agency to make their own decisions. Only Jalen's lack of defensive intensity had serious legs as an issue of concern (and that's not exactly uncommonly in young players), but it didn't take long for him to start trying on that end once Fred & Dillon were on the court barking at him. || Yes casuals || I'm not a rockets fan but I know a bunch and most of then had been thinking it's going well even before this. If you know Paulo Alves from the Lager Line, we speak a decent amount on discord and he's always been positive about the direction of the rebuild, even when moves have seemed questionable at the time he's usually come up with a positive spin within a couple of days. || I've been a Wolves fan ever since they acquired Cassell, so I agree with this. 

Plus, they fumbled the Butler situation horribly.

Management & ownership have been issues until recently. || I still think you need All-Stars to win a title. And I don’t feel those guys are on that trajectory.  And granted these days that is a pretty damn high bar.

Idk those guys have pretty bad efficiency and typically when your workload increases, your efficiency decreases. But i mostly have been boxscore scouting and only really watching them when they play the Wolves so will admit Im missing there. || You clearly have a good basketball mind. Would be interesting to hear your thoughts on the OK rebuild too! || Jalen, Sengun, Tari and Tate are the only ones on the Rockets roster now who played under Silas. I wouldn't say their development was helped at all by their time under his coaching. || Funny that you mention Prod by name. He and Don Knock's 'Safe Spaces' on Twitter is where the vitriol began way back in October of 2021. Paulo would start each space off raging against Silas's coaching and begging for him to be fired as early as a dozen games into Jalen's career. When I went against his views and tried to explain the pedagogical value behind Silas's 'learn-by-mistakes' methods to calm the fanbase, Paulo and Don (and later Will) literally banned me from talking about that information, claiming the venue was inappropriate for such discussion. Then, when I held my own Space to try to explain what was happening, they spread lies about what I was saying and personally attacked me as ""delusional"", ""jealous"", ""a fascist"" (even called me a Nazi 😂), and ""a pussy"" amongst other things.

So, no. He and other large accounts were not only **not** ""positive about the direction of the rebuild"", they were literally leading their 'Fire Silas' agenda by throwing gasoline on the fans' flames and censoring views that could portray it in a positive light. || You're missing Jabari from that list. A guy who literally praised Silas for the things I brought up in the post.

And as already mentioned, everyone on the team agrees that AlP's defense improved greatly under him, and SengÜn credited Silas for training him to run point (even if it rarely happens in the current offensive schemes). || Well yes silas also definitely needed to be fired though

He was terrible, I know that FVV and Brooks helped make the rockets more competent, but the rockets offensive process was pretty horrific under silas and the defensive effort was terrible. Two things that are largely determined by coaching.

If ProdiG called you a nazi then you probably said some shit, he doesn't say stuff like that for no reason. || His podcast partner, Don Knock, was actually the one who called me a Nazi. He claimed I was trying to tell fans how to react because I said ""You have to have patience with young players"". Paulo was pushing the narrative that I'm just a jealous crazy guy who fans should ignore.

Hard disagree on the idea Silas needed to be fired for reasons that I went into in the original post (as well as a number of others which would form the basis of the continuation to this post that I didn't have time or room for here... and which also seemed irrelevant to the basic premise that most of that was happening was intentional with the belief that these were switches that could be easily flipped heading into Phase 2)"
LeBron James,LeBron James,2024-11-08,nbadiscussion,1gmkls7,Bradley Beal is playing the best defense of his life,"Have you ever thought about how rechargeable batteries work?

Like most people, I assume, I never gave them much thought. You plug one into an outlet, and portable electricity just sort of piles up inside, like filling up a champagne flute with Miller High Life, right?

That, of course, isn’t quite accurate. As you use a battery, electrons flow from the negative end to the positive end. When equilibrium is established, flow ceases, and the battery dies. To charge the battery, you have to put in energy to reverse the flow and force electrons back to the negative side.

Apologies to any engineers out there for the gross oversimplification, but I was thinking about the flow of electrons from one end to the other when considering Bradley Beal’s career arc. Few players have had as many ups (relatively) and downs (absolutely) as Beal. He’s had multiple seasons with a [Defensive Estimated Plus/Minus ](https://dunksandthrees.com/player/203078)in the bottom decile!

*\[As always with these posts, I've collected a bunch of clips and graphs to illustrate my points. They* [*can be viewed in one place in-context here*](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)*. Thanks for reading!\]* 

Of course, in each of those years, Beal was an elite offensive player, generally making up for his porous defense. However, since his trade to Phoenix last season, Beal has understood his assignment better than most. By almost any measure, he’s playing at or near career-best defensive levels, forcing electrons from one side of his battery to the other.

To wit, here is a chart I made with his D-EPM percentiles by year: \[[chart here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

Most players don’t have the peaks and valleys we see above, and it’s even rarer to see someone reach new heights in their 13th season. To further my case, here is his Defensive DARKO chart, another all-in-one defensive metric: \[[chart here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

You and I don’t need to know exactly what goes into those models to understand what they’re saying: the defensive battery is fully recharged!

If you’re not into alphabet soups, Beal’s newfound defensive prowess is borne out in more easily digestible ways, too. Beal is averaging the most steals and blocks of his career so far (which, naturally, means he sports [the highest Defensive Box Plus/Minus](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bealbr01.html) of his life by a mile). Phoenix lineups with Beal [only give up 111.3 points per 100 possessions](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/231/lineups#tab-four_factors), a well above-average mark.

NBA players do not usually see a massive defensive upswing in their 30s; defense is a younger man’s game, reliant upon quick-twitch athleticism and endurance. But Beal’s defense is far from a numbers-driven narrative. Coach Mike Budenholzer has deployed him as the starters’ point-of-attack pitbull. [NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203078/head-to-head) says his primary defensive matchups have included Tyrese Maxey, Anfernee Simons, and LeBron James (perhaps somewhat of James’ choosing, but they haven’t been eaten up in those minutes!), and BBall-Index says that Beal has had the toughest defensive assignments of any Suns starter by a mile.

Now, he’s hardly perfect. I’m not trying to pull an [Anna Sorokin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Sorokin) here; Beal won’t be making anybody’s All-Defensive teams. As a small-ish guard, he can only do so much against bigger players. He occasionally gets caught going under screens when he should go over, and bizarrely, at least twice, I’ve seen him tying his shoe in the middle of the defensive action: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

But shoelace issues aside, the effort level is consistently there. He’s putting in the energy to reverse the flow. How often have we seen a player go from max-contract, first-option status to grit-and-grinder almost overnight? How many undersized former 30-point scorers add the ability late in their career to destroy a 3-on-1 fastbreak like a miniature Draymond Green? \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

Although he’s been around seemingly forever, Beal is just 31 years old, and he still has excellent lateral agility and a 6’7” wingspan. He has some good (though not great) physical tools, and as the charts above show, he’s unleashed them in a way we haven’t seen in years. He’s playing hard, like when he fights through two screens to contest a Tyrese Maxey triple here: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

Or here, where he effortlessly flits past two more screens again and harasses Tyler Herro into a slip: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

I hear you harrumphing. Rock-solid screen navigation, but not precisely highlight-worthy, right? That’s sort of the point. This is what Beal looks like all the time: *workmanlike*. You can go pretty far with a coherent defensive scheme and effort in the NBA.

“I’m very excited about taking on the task of guarding guys,” [Beal said a few days ago.](https://arizonasports.com/story/3563061/suns-defense-bradley-beal-improve/) “I just think that’s another level I can tap into.”

And that’s a level that the entire Suns *team* has tapped into. It’s true that Phoenix has faced a slate of opposing offenses more crippled than me after my forthcoming meniscus repair — two games against the Clippers without Kawhi plus a match against an Embiid-less 76ers team — but they’ve maintained a level of focus and intensity we haven’t seen from the Durant-era Suns in the past.

The Suns switch less than they used to, and Budenholzer has challenged his players to get over screens and stay attached to the ballhandler’s hip. Coach Bud’s teams are almost always elite defensively, and he has a strict ethos passed down from his days on Spurs coach Gregg Popovich’s staff: [never, ever foul](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/which-new-nba-head-coach-is-best).

For a guy oft-criticized in the past for being too rigid, Budenholzer has changed his defensive philosophy in important ways (besides the no-fouls mandate). For example, his old Bucks teams used to allow opposing teams to shoot as many threes as they wanted, as long as those shots came from suboptimal shooters. Teams have gotten so good at shooting over the last few seasons, however, that this strategy is no longer tenable. His final Milwaukee season [saw the Bucks rank fourth in three-point attempt rate](https://thef5.substack.com/p/pushing-buttons) allowed after being bottom-five in the previous four seasons. So far, the Suns have[ been top-10 in disallowing threes](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/24/team#tab-shooting_defense_frequency) (including third in preventing corner threes) and 11th in opposing free-throw rate (a number I expect to improve over time with fewer games against the freebie-tastic Lakers).

The Suns rarely force turnovers (another Bud trademark), preferring to stay disciplined in their approach, but they clean the defensive glass at an elite mark. Add it all up, and you have a defensive identity that is both clear and (so far, at least) effective.

It’s tempting to say Phoenix’s defense is more than the sum of its parts, but that’s doing the parts a discourtesy. Jusuf Nurkic is an excellent drop defender with surprisingly quick hands, even if he can struggle with more mobile matchups (see his benching against AD). He doesn’t get nearly the love he deserves for his long-time defensive prowess.

Royce O’Neale is the consummate 3-and-D professional (and a vastly underrated playmaker, but I digress) who has been a change-of-pace small-ball five throughout the season. Rookie Ryan Dunn is already the best defender on the team, a grizzly bear mirroring footsteps like a particularly toothy shadow. He’s the situational break-glass player for when the Suns need some bigger perimeter help. Devin Booker has been his customary solid self, and Kevin Durant has been more than solid. Grayson Allen, Mason Plumlee, and Tyus Jones are not gifted individual defenders, but they know the gameplan, and they execute.

When it all comes together, Phoenix can string together some gorgeous sequences: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best)\]

It’s a long season. A lot can go wrong for both the injury-prone Beal (already nursing an elbow injury) and his squad. The Suns are a rickety bunch at the best of times, and we don’t know how they will hold up when they go against more dangerous offenses.

But it’s hard to point to what the Suns should be doing better, given their competition so far, and it starts with their third-wheel star embracing his new role as a high-energy stopper. Beal’s battery is full, and if it can keep a charge through the playoffs, Phoenix’s 7-1 start will prove no fluke.",135,12,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1gmkls7/bradley_beal_is_playing_the_best_defense_of_his/,2024-11-08 10:04:57,"> NBA players do not usually see a massive defensive upswing in their 30s; defense is a younger man’s game, reliant upon quick-twitch athleticism and endurance. 

Not necessarily ""massive"", but I think so much of defense is also BBIQ and effort that I see a lot of guys get better later even though they don't quite have the same agility and reflexes as before. Seems especially common for big scorers, possibly because earlier in their career they don't put the same effort into defense because they are younger hotshots who only care about their offense, or maybe they get better at conserving energy on offense while still being effective scorers, so that even though they are older they now have more energy for defense?

Curry for example started out as a defensive liability but by his late 20s had improved to average-to-good and mostly just appeared weak because he was surrounded by even better defenders. Durant made a big defensive leap in the middle of his career. Karl Malone (POS though he was) was always a decent defender but he got better in his mid 30s somehow. It's not just superstars though - Michael Finley is one guy who came to mind as never being thought of as a defender but then became one of the best Dirk-slower-downer options because he knew he wasn't a big-time scorer any more so he rededicated his defensive effort. Late-career Richard Jefferson seems to have had a similar revelation when his scoring ability declined.

Obviously you have some guys who go the other way, like Kobe who was a quality defender in his 20s and then got really lazy in his 30s other than a few big highlight games per year.  

Then you have some guys who just change their defense as they get older to fit their game. E.g. young Jason Kidd was a really good defender, and old Jason Kidd couldn't quite stay in front of smaller quicker guards like he used to - so instead he'd often switch onto bigger wings and use his strength and positioning against them. || Thanks for reading! You can find all [the clips and charts located in-context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/bradley-beal-is-playing-the-best).

I find the Suns' early start to be one of the most interesting storylines in the league so far, and I'm excited to see what they do as they face stiffer competition. They were a better-than-expected defense last year, so who knows? || You lost me by prefacing the post by ranting about batteries for quite some time, but just going by your title, yes - it's refreshing to see a 31-year old play the best defense of his career. Especially a former elite scorer, since those guys often have a hard time accepting their role towards the end of their career. || Bro, I read this as a youtube video with the beginning starting off with battery talk and you linking it to Bradley Beal, this was brilliant  || I admittedly haven't watched much Suns ball this year beyond highlights (which rarely show team defense), but I thought they had a masterful offseason in addressing their deficiencies, and them drafting Dunn was probably my favorite team fit pick in the entire draft. Getting improved defensive effort from their core seems like icing on the cake. Also appreciate the changes that Budenholzer has made to his defensive schemes over time.

I am curious about what stats you're using for disallowing corner 3s though, I think you're talking about the number of corner 3s attempted. I think it is worth noting they give up an extremely high percentage on corner 3s and are 11th-worst in terms of opponent makes. I get that it's early season and so you can't read too much into the percentages, but the same is true for attempts... they've had four total games against the LA teams, who are both bottom-5 in corner three-point attempts, so it might be premature to read too much into being 9th best in terms of opponent corner 3s attempted.

This set of stats is a subject I've been digging into a bit regarding my Raptors lately, because they're one of the best in the league in terms of limiting above-the-break threes (in all of makes, attempts, and percentage) as the result of really great point of attack defense (mostly because with several starters out we've got increased minutes for Davion Mitchell, Shead, and Agbaji, all of whom have been fantastic individually at the PoA). But the Raptors, like the Suns, are around 10th best in terms of opponent corner 3s taken, but both teams have allowed a really high percentage of makes on those. The eye-test for me for the Raptors suggests that what corner 3s are given up are usually late in plays and the result of good initial defense and then a missed rotation, scramble mode, and an eventual wide-open look, hence the high percentages... so I do think that despite the small sample size, the high percentage is telling of where their weaknesses are. Do you think with the Suns the high percentage allowed on corner 3s is just statistical noise there and will come down?

(Personally I liked the battery metaphor and this was a really good read, but my eyes started to glaze over at first, then I scrolled down and found the external link and enjoyed the article reading it there. Part of it I think is that on reddit, when there's a huge wall of text and it starts with a metaphor that isn't clear, it can be a bit daunting and feel like someone's wasting your time; but on a different platform where I'm prepared to just sit and read, it's great. I realize that there's likely subreddit rules preventing you from linking to that at the top of the article.) || cover command cows murky escape silky tease nine wide edge

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* || You have some good points. I think that a lot of the guys you cite who became better defenders still guarded relatively weaker opponents. Beal both playing well *and* playing well against the other team's best guards is unusual, and that's generally borne out by the data. But there are plenty of exceptions, as you note. || Truthfully, that metaphor would have had more juice, I promise, but I had to take a sick kid to the ER at 230am last night (he's totally fine now) -- didn't have the energy this morning to really bring it together ha. || Refreshing but not sustainable, you can't be paying a smaller below elite athletic guard who has just started playing defence at 31 max money.

He simply can't be as good defensively to make up for the lack of depth they have due partially to his salary. || Thank you very much! I put out stuff like this 2-3x at [www.basketballpoetry.com](http://www.basketballpoetry.com), so check that out if you're so inclined.

I've thought about actual Youtube videos for years, but I don't know much about video editing and it feels daunting ha. I think I'll stick to words for now. || Thanks for the feedback, and I'm glad at least someone enjoyed the battery thing (it was not a popular introduction haha). Yeah, the reading experience on my external site is so superior, but I've run into self-promo issues before, so I do my best to abide by the sub rules. 

Regarding corner threes, you make some great points about the Lakers in particular, but I'm optimistic this Suns team will continue to prevent corner threes because A) you can see it's a focus on film, and B) Bud's last Milwuakee team was literally the league's best at preventing them, per Cleaning the Glass. It's just a thing he's become laser-focused on. So I think that's sticky.

As for corner accuracy, that's a contentious thing in analytical circles, as you probably know. Basically, the current mode of thinking is that you can control whether an opponent *attempts* a three, but you can't control whether or not they *make* it. I don't want to believe that, but I and others have looked at a lot of data around this over the years, and basically it seems to hold true. Even teams with elite closeout guys and length everywhere can sometimes give up very high 3-point percentages for a year. The Pelicans are hte most notable counter-example, having been at the top of the league in allowed 3P% for two straight years, but this year they're 25th. So I can't say what will happen in terms of shooting %s allowed for the Raptors or Suns.

Shead, I think, is a perfect example of this. He's so good on-ball at getting into dribbler's bodies and disrupting them that often they can't even get a shot off. But I've also seen guys like LaMelo just completely ignore him when he's coming out to them because he's too small for his contests to matter once the space to attempt a shot has already been established; then, it's just ""does the shooter make it or miss it."" Once a shooter decides that he has the space to get up the shot, it really doesn't matter who the closer-outter is, as far as I can tell, even if that's counter to what I want to believe about defense. || we still would have had to read it all..."

Make sure that scoring record will never be broken lmao || It is absolutely bonkers that a guy is averaging 23/8/9 on 59% TS and we’re talking about retirement for him. Like I get all the context around it, but just imagine if he truly just wanted to keep playing until he literally wasn’t worth a rotation spot on a team. I stg he might be able to do that at 
50. || 23-8-9 at 51% shooting is still all-star level. 

that’s a regression for Lebron.

that’s how fucking good he is. || I think this largely depends on what he wants to do in retirement.  But I’d love to see him acknowledge that he’s entered his final years and retire in Cleveland. Come off the bench and/or play limited minutes with the understanding that his role is to mentor and mold their young stars into one final ring. Then work his way into ownership or basketball operations and attempt to create a dynasty with the home team. With Kevin Love in management as well. || Retire in the 2025-2026 season before his stats start dipping like he hinted. He’s already in the goat convo and he said he doesn’t wanna be “that guy.” - if he leaves while still being somewhat dominant that will create the lasting aura he’d want for his legacy. The stories of how long he could have played would get mythical (up there with what if MJ didn’t retire twice in his prime for example). || i think if i were lebron james id talk to my coach about playing fewer minutes first. i know the lakers have injuries and not that deep of a bench, but he needs to get more bench time so he can play both sides of the floor when he’s out there || The point production isn't the big problem. The Lakers are playing 4v5 on D, most of the time. || I think he stays with the lakers through this year because I think he would only want to play in Golden State (staying in California: easy travel to LA and always wanting to play with Curry and Draymond). The problems for a deal getting done this year are that the only way to get it done is with involving Wiggins in the deal and I really don’t think the Warriors want to do that. Wiggins is an essential part of them winning a title and who I think they really want to trade the most is Kuminga: problem is his salary only counts for 8 or 9m for this year. I think they wait until the offseason to get the deal done with a Kuminga S&T so they can hold onto Wiggins and next year will be Lebron’s last year, year 23 for number 23, playing on the numerical significance AND it will be a last dance for both him and Curry. Couldn’t write a better script than this. || If I'm lebron 

I retire and every day I take a new ""I can't believe this is my life"" picture || Listen, I’m a Celtics fan, i fucking hate lebron.

That said, hes the only person that belongs with Michael in GOAT convos, that’s in of itself is an accomplishment.

He needs to rest a bit, I think he’s a bit rock by the offense going through AD and that happens, but if he can get some rest in and lose the bronny bs he’s still a top 10 player. || We’re 2 seasons away from Lebron being so far ahead in most stats that they’ll never be overtaken. He has had lows this season but also some very high highs, so I don’t think it’s set that he should retire at the end of this year.

Father Time is fighting, but Lebron is fighting back, as a fan I want to see how long he can escape time. What this season has proven is that in the necessary games he can still put up incredible performances. I wish the Lakers were a legitimate contender, because I still think he can be a top 5 player in the playoffs. In the regular season he’s too old to put up great performances consistently, but with finite games, he still has fight in him. I think he should finish out his current contract, and under very specific circumstances play 1 or 2 more after that, but more then likely call it a career at the end of the 2025-2026 season. || I think lebron players 25 years because its a nice number to quote all the time , that no other human can reach. It will be so impressive and unique the “stat padder” jabs dont matter anymore || If I'm him I'm playing two more years to try and play with my other son as well, which is what I expect him to do. Especially since, unlike Bronny, Brice actually looks like he's going to be a legit NBA prospect || The entire premise of this post is off base. LeBron is currently averaging numbers he’s only matched once before—in 2017—and which have only been achieved 12 times in NBA history.

He’s also recorded more triple-doubles through the first 23 games than ever before. His previous highs were 5 in 2019 and 4 in 2007, but he already has 7 this season.

What regression?

The only valid critique was his shooting slump, but after going 6-10 from three last night, it looks like he’s already back to his pre-slump form. || Retire. It always sucks to see a guy hang on too long when it's obvious they don't have their fastball anymore.


Ex: Tom Brady. If Brady retires after losing to the Rams he goes out looking like the Apex Predator he was. Instead Tom plays that final year and looks like he doesn't want to be there before getting destroyed by Dallas in the playoffs.  || It’s not about his offense. He deliberately save his energy on D. No rotation no movement no boxing out no helping. Lakers defense can’t be improved when the leader calculates how to reserve his energy to score. It’s a shit show. || I see him doing some ring chasing. I'm sure the number 6 lives rent free in his mind || He should have gone back to Cleveland in off season, they would have burned a 2nd on Bronny. That would have been a good team and almost guaranteed ECF in the east || He won't for two reasons:
1. He said he won't 
2. He has already stopped playing defense for some years so in some ways his game has already regressed and unless he's perfect on offense like usual he won't have the same importance on a team that he feels like he deserves, and he's kinda regressing rn so i give him two years still || i would join a team that needs a point guard/forward and allows me to play both sides of the ball instead of needing to shoulder the burden of the entire offence. || If I was LeBron, what I would have done would have happened last summer. I get he wants to get his cash and the Lakers have been loyal to him and gave him an extra $100MM contract this summer. 

But I would also have realized that a title isn't in the cards in LA no matter what. 

I would have called up Cleveland and told them to draft Bronny and I would sign there as a FA for whatever they had available. Sure, I lose $90M in cash, but I am a billionaire, and I would rather contend for a title with my son in my hometown than to be a .500 team in LA with an extra $90m. 

So I sign with Cleveland, they draft Bronny and he signs with Cleveland. Now the Cavs have a lineup of: 

* Mobley/Allen
* LeBron/ Wade
* Okoro / LaVert
* Dono/ Jerome
* Garland / Bronny

Legit title contender back in my hometown with my son? That sounds pretty amazing for the old legacy. Get that 5th title like Kobe and Duncan. 

----------

Alternatively, tell the Knicks to do the same thing. Knicks have me and my boy Bronny, so they don't need to waste 5 picks on Bridges. Can use Randle, Bojan and the picks to get center depth. Brunson, LeBron, Hart, Donte, OG and McBride plus whatever they can get to help out in the Mitchell Robinson absence. 

What is going to lift his legacy more than bringing the Knicks to their first title in over 50 years, especially if they can do it over rival Celtics? And doing it with your son waving a towel, too!

But hey, being a .500 team with no defense and an extra $90M in your pocket is fun as well. || I will play one more year, and I will average 23 ppg in my 23rd year while wearing number 23. || Play until I can.

Why not? Legacy? You only have one opportunity (unless you're MJ) so make the most out of it. Put the media aside and focus on what you enjoy doing. || Until he has lost value. A solid role-player averaging 15/6/6 would still be a great player but if Bron did this, yall would throw your toys as if he's a bum. || You try to win 1 more on a different team before retiring. Maybe MIA, CLE, GSW, NYK, PHI, SAS. Somewhere like that. || [removed] || He’s no where close to an all star level. He’ll be an all star because it’s a popularity contest, but won’t be the most deserving. Dudes a turnover machine and plays less than 0 defense.

What’s he a negative 16.9 points on off?? Historically bad. Jokers a plus 30 on off. So he’s 49 points better than LeBron lol 

He shouldn’t play more than 20-25 minutes so he can give full effort at all times. || Na. 

  
Lebron is a liability to his team at the end of the game. Consitently Terrible posessions.

  
And everyone has so much respect for him/their gonna keep giving it to him. I probably would to. || It's pretty much iced already. Kareem's record stood for 40 years. Karl Malone missed 4 games over 13 seasons and still couldn't catch him. No one's ever been as good as LeBron is at 40, and he averaged 20 at 19 years old. 

His only hit 30 once, so if someone had similar longevity and a couple of seasons in the mid 30s it's theoretically possible, but highly unlikely. || The only one with the smallest chance right now is Luka. He’s at 29 points per game through his 7th season. And yet, he would still need 15 healthy seasons at 25 PPG to break LeBron’s record now. 

I selfishly wanted to see LeBron get to 44k/12k/12k, just fucking absurd videogame numbers. But that requires being healthy and elite this season and next season. And I finally am not not sure he has it in him. || He’s my GOAT, but the numbers don’t quite capture his lack of impact at this point. He’s still an excellent offensive player when he needs to be (not great when he’s standing around off ball), but his defense is poor and that’s reflected by the Lakers being 15 points per 100 better without him. Which is fine, he’s turning 40 and still amazing. || He seriously could be a 10th man playing 10 minutes a night for 10 years || I think his scoring will trend upward as well. His 3 pointer was dead for a few games. I’m not sure he can get back over 25, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he ends the year at 24/8/9. Which for him would be a regression. || Maybe it’s not 2025, but per OP’s point, there WILL come a time when LeBron and Klutch Sports have to decide whether LeBron is willing to say to a coaching staff: “Use me however you need to, even if it’s 15 minutes per game.”

To me, that’s where the real speculation is—not when (2025? 2027?) this happens, but whether it happens. || [removed] || [removed] || I\`d say 1.5v5 is more accurate but yeah || Keep in mind he has a no trade clause so he would have to sign off on it and I think the only way he does that is if it’s going to Golden State || Lebron has a player option after this season. He can opt out and sign with whoever he wants || Well, if he wanted to stay in California, then he could always go to Sacramento!

/s || He does? I only heard that Bryce is actually ranked lower than Bronny at the same age || Box score stats don’t fully show the decline. This is the first season, other than rookie season, where his defensive rating is worse than his offensive rating. The defensive decline has made him undoubtedly one of the worst defenders in the league and that is ruining the Lakers entirely. He’s averaging some of the most touches in his career, while being frankly worse at almost everything offensively. There’s nothing about it that’s good. We haven’t even gone into the glaring on/off numbers and lineup data which show him being the common denominator in the Lakers worst performing lineups. Make no mistake, Bron right now is a shell of himself compared to even last year. Most of his stats this year are padded by high usage, touches and time of possession, but with way worse player efficiency overall. He’d be better off becoming a role player and filling the void left by having no Jared Vanderbilt. Lakers could use more of that and less ball dominance. || Don’t look at stats, look at his movement, his athletic ability…don’t compare stats to what he did 10 seasons ago and think he’s still in his prime, that’s stupid, game changed and he benefits a lot from it in his stats.

His record might outlast the association || There may be a Lebron with steph’ shooting hybrid. The og lebron should make it more difficult for that future anomaly lol || Far from guaranteed. The U.S. and NBA could very well cease to exist in 100 years.

Somewhat more seriously, barring a massive NBA increase in pace while somehow mitigating injuries, LeBron’s scoring record could very well be  unbreakable. It’s his health that is most anomalous - 20+ years at a high level without barely any time lost to injury would have seemed impossible to most people if not for the fact that he’s done it. || Won't happen, players are gonna be playing less games and less minutes.

To beat this record you're gonna have to be an elite 18 year old and constantly play, without injuries, go deep in playoffs for extra games and points, play big minutes.

No one is doing it || this is one of those records that will stand forever because statistically its just absurd. Same with what Messi has done. || I’d be suprised if Luka came within 10k of it || technically those don’t count towards the all time scoring record, which is just regular season points.

Lebron is good when he tries problem is he doesnt try very often. some of the others are so bad they might as well not be playing defense at all || Why not? I could very easily see him going to Cleveland or New York for his final year. Maybe he wants to try and end his career on a championship, maybe he just wants a casual farewell tour.

Actually it was only 8 days in this case because there was a 3 in 4 days stretch in there. 

More importantly Lebron was shooting 8.2/14 from 2 or 58.5%. Which was not only above leagur average but also an improvement on his average this season. While averaging 8.6 assists and 7.2 rebounds. Which was worse than earlier in the year but pretty normal for Lebron throughout the last 10 years. It was pretty much just a 3 point shooting slump.

This is a subreddit for thoughtful discussion and debate, not aggressive and argumentative content. || [removed] || +/- is horrible to use in Lebrons case because he gets thrown out with the bench while AD rests, so his plus minus tanks because he’s the only one producing on offense, and everyone isn’t great defensively. Not saying he’s been great on defense, but he’s better than those numbers say. He definitely rotates more than Rui or Knecht at the VERY least. || I mean, not just untouchable. if they shorten the season any significant amount, it'd basically turn the whole 70 years of NBA counting stats into a series of Wilt-esque statistical outliers that aren't worth considering when you discuss modern players. my guess is they'd pretty quickly have pre-shortened season and post-shortened season records on separate lists"
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-01-13,nbadiscussion,1i0ctna,"Russell Westbrook, problem or solution? [OC Analysis]","If you’re reading this, you already have thoughts on Russell Westbrook. Outside of LeBron James, perhaps no player in the league has engendered capital-F Feelings in people over the years quite like him.

But I’m not here to relitigate a past that has little bearing on the present. The Nuggets brought the future Hall of Famer in to add some nastiness, bolster their playmaking, and, perhaps most importantly, fix the critical non-Jokic minutes. Has Westbrook been the answer, or has he been merely a lovely shade of porcine lipstick?

Westbrook has filled highlight reels with some big performances of late after moving into the starting unit for the injured Aaron Gordon. Lineup data is all based on relatively small samples, but predictably, the team’s defense cratered. The Nuggets’ core four (Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr., Christian Braun, and Nikola Jokic) give up[ 13.2 more points per 100 possessions](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/8/lineups#tab-four_factors) with Westbrook in Gordon’s place, a massive drop that takes the unit’s defense from average-ish to woeful. (That number was 9.8 until yesterday’s bizarre game against a Doncic and Irving-less Dallas squad, in which the Nuggets’ starters got absolutely blitzed out of the gate).

Gordon is the starting group’s best forward guardsman and a strong team defender, too. Replacing him with the smaller Westbrook predictably opened some cracks.

What wasn’t so predictable: replacing Gordon with Westbrook has taken an already good offensive lineup from Mile High to atmospheric heights. The starters with Russ have scored [130.6 points per 100 minutes,](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/8/lineups#tab-four_factors) eight more points than with Gordon, and in the 93rd percentile for any lineup. (Further swapping Murray for sharpshooting sixth man Strawther has been unbelievably potent, albeit on barely over 100 possessions).

*\[Thanks for reading! I've collected* [nearly a dozen video clips that can be viewed in context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or) *or at the various links throughout the article.\]*

What changes? Some of it is understandable. The Westbrook-led starters [get into transition at a a top-decile rate ](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/8/lineups#tab-context_trans_offense)despite being bad at forcing turnovers and defensive rebounding. Those two things usually jump-start the break, but Westbrook is more than happy to push off made baskets, too. He has always been an anthropomorphic NOS tank. Inject him into any offensive engine to watch that thing giddy up and *go:* \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

Notice that Westbrook wasn’t the one who made that basket; Synergy says he’s in the [16th percentile as a transition finisher](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/players/67001b9dff56573c7c3b3a0d/playtypes?seasonId=66ec94cbd172189f95bf08b2&competitionId=non-exhibition-54457dce300969b132fcfb34&compsCategory=1) this year. But there’s tremendous value in attacking unset defenses, particularly with Jokic around to clean up the mess. Since December 6th, Westbrook has driven [9.2 times](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives?DateFrom=12/06/2024&dir=D&sort=DRIVES) on just [63 touches](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/touches?DateFrom=12/06/2024&dir=D&sort=TOUCHES) per game, about the same rate as Giannis Antetokounmpo, and he has the [sixth-highest assist rate](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives?CF=DRIVES*GE*5:GP*GE*5&DateFrom=12/06/2024&dir=D&sort=DRIVE_AST_PCT) on those drives.

That passing sings. Despite (or perhaps *because* of\*)\* his gaudy assist totals, Westbrook has long been underrated as a pure passing technician. This forty-foot lefty bounce pass splitting two defenders is a sexy little number: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

Unsurprisingly, Westbrook had instant-oatmeal chemistry with Jokic in both directions. Westbrook’s ability to understand where teammates want to catch the ball meshes beautifully with Jokic’s Picasso creativity. Jokic misses here, but this is a perfect example of the mind meld the two players share: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

And Westbrook’s underrated cutting generates easy attempts for the team, even if he occasionally glitches on the shot. You don’t see too many airballed layups, but the fact that the Nuggets could even *create* a shot this good is still promising: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

Over time, Westbrook has gradually developed some ionic bonds with Jamal Murray, too. Murray has looked very comfortable next to Westbrook in more of a combo guard role. Westbrook is a historically great hit-ahead passer, so Murray’s been digging out clever positioning, secure in the knowledge that someone other than Jokic is capable of finding him: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

It’s not all good. The turnovers have been a problem, although the team is inclined to forgive errors of aggression. Westbrook’s usual shooting warts are still fully on display. The 32% he’s shooting from the three-point line this season is the best accuracy he’s posted since the 2016-17 season, nearly a decade ago. Westbrook has actually been quite good on his few corner threes, but he’s below [25% on above-the-break triples](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/201566/shooting?Season=2024-25), which he shoots far more often.

Defenses certainly don’t respect Westbrook’s shot, but it’s arguably less damaging on the Nuggets than on nearly any other team. Why? Well, in other places, defenses would put their center on Westbrook and let them play free safety. But on the Nuggets, all big bodies need to stay attached to Jokic. So even if Westbrook’s defender has the freedom to roam, they aren’t the sort of intimidating backline defenders who might usually roam the paint. In the best situations, Westbrook can turn a defense’s disrespect against them, like when he manufactures this switch of Spencer Dinwiddie onto Jokic: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

On the other side of the court, I once described Westbrook’s defense as making mean faces and running in random directions, but that was the old Russ. Present-day Westbrook has been sometimes awesome, occasionally abysmal, but surprisingly solid overall. Denver’s transition defense is not good, and Westbrook’s casual jogs back aren’t helpful. He’s still vulnerable to back cuts, and there are possessions where he doesn’t quite seem to know what he’s supposed to be doing: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

However, these possessions are far fewer than they used to be. Westbrook revitalized himself as an on-ball defender under Ty Lue for the Clippers in recent seasons, shedding some of his worst tendencies. This year, he’s posting his highest combined stock (steal+block) rate *ever* on a per-possession basis. Advanced metrics like [EPM ](https://dunksandthrees.com/player/201566/historical)and [LEBRON](https://www.bball-index.com/leaderboards-tool/) grade him as a well above-average defender overall, although they’ve taken more of a shine to his defensive impact than I have.

He’s spent 21% of his time guarding centers and power forwards, [per BBall-Index](https://www.bball-index.com/leaderboards-tool/), where his strength, low center of gravity, and all-around orneriness are assets. Notably, he stonewalled Victor Wembanyama one-on-one a few times during the Nuggets’ epic back-to-back games against the Spurs: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

Synergy defensive metrics are notoriously finicky, but as of yesterday morning, they showed that Russ has allowed a better-than-median point-for-possession on [*every playtype they track*](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/players/67001b9dff56573c7c3b3a0d/playtypes?seasonId=66ec94cbd172189f95bf08b2&competitionId=560100ac8dc7a24394b955ee&offense=false), whether it’s guarding the pick-and-roll ballhandler, closing out on spot-up shooters, chasing around screens or hand-offs, switching onto big men in the post, tagging rollers, or jailing dudes in isolation. Some of these are based on insanely small sample sizes, but it’s still impressive.

Of course, while Westbrook has done well individually on that end, the starting group’s overall defense has suffered of late. The Nuggets are perilously small without Gordon. None of the current starting group can consistently guard the sort of big forwards that litter the Western Conference like Gordon can, and the Nuggets sorely miss AG’s verticality and rebounding. Additionally, [teams have been lights out from deep against the Westbrook starting group](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/8/lineups#tab-shooting_defense_fg), punishing the lineup’s defensive rating.

It’s not Westbrook’s fault, exactly. Denver just needs what Gordon provides. The offense has been so incendiary that the defense’s relative woes mostly have been swept under the rug, but coach Mike Malone undoubtedly has noticed the difference.

Still, statistically, at least, Russ has been far better than could have been reasonably expected. He’s been a fine individual defender and neutral offensive force at worst (and I’d argue a smidge better than that), but his impact goes beyond the stats. It’s tricky to judge chemistry or leadership from a TV screen, but reporters have relayed how much [the team values his edginess](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6053848/2025/01/11/westbrook-jokic-nuggets-nba-triple-double/), something missing since Bruce Brown departed after the championship parade. Michael Malone mentioned in the preseason that [Westbrook’s trash-talking had become contagious](https://x.com/DNVR_Nuggets/status/1848451169074512330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1848451169074512330%7Ctwgr%5Ec631d2761b9dd338d1644e172e4b32f0c0a58796%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fftw.usatoday.com%2F2024%2F10%2Frussell-westbrook-nuggets-talking-shit-contagious-video), spurring a notoriously quiet Nuggets group. And I can’t get over this adorable clip of his excitement after an emphatic Christian Braun three from the other day: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

Kids today talk about auras, but the kids from yesterday would say that the vibes are immaculate.

That does beg an obvious question. Things are going swimmingly right now, but with Aaron Gordon returning from injury yesterday, how does Malone optimize his rotation? “[I don’t look forward](https://x.com/NBABlackburn/status/1875340534358970716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1875340534358970716%7Ctwgr%5Ea7e7b7f8aca5ade858595f98fe8ba9808a82e0aa%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.si.com%2Fnba%2Fnuggets%2Fnews%2Fmichael-malone-s-statement-on-russell-westbrook-lineup-decision-01jgqjnp9ej7),” he replied coyly, and he’ll have a few days to figure it out as Gordon ramps up his minutes. But soon, he’ll need to make some hard decisions.

Because despite all the welcome success Westbrook has had next to Jokic… he’s virtually *only* had it next to Jokic. When those two are on the court together, the Nuggets obliterate opponents. In the \~750 possessions Jokic has sat and Westbrook has played, the [Nuggets have had a point differential in the second (2nd!) percentile](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/8/lineups?on=3914&off=1883#tab-four_factors).

The fundamental problem with every Nuggets team for the last infinite years is that they get destroyed in the non-Jokic minutes. Rather than alleviating that crisis, Westbrook has somehow further elevated the Jokic *on* minutes and worsened the Jokic *off* minutes! He’s both solution and problem.

That said, things aren’t quite as bad as they sound. The Nuggets with Westbrook and Murray together (no Jokic) have [only been outscored by -3.8 points per 100](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/8/lineups?on=3914&on=2631&off=1883#tab-four_factors) possessions, a respectably poor number. Recent lineups with those two, the shooter Strawther, the help defender Watson, and the fossil DeAndre Jordan have actually outscored opponents in their limited time together. So Malone may have found some units that can doggy-paddle in the deep end while the big man catches his breath, although we’ll need a much larger sample to be sure.

Should Westbrook stay on the court for tip-offs? Fans are clamoring for it; his 13-4 record as a starter sure is shiny, and certain lineup stats support it. With Gordon back, I believe Westbrook will return to a bench role (for now) but will play bigger minutes with the core group. Gordon, Braun, and perhaps even Jamal Murray or Michael Porter Jr., on nights where they don’t have it, may all see minutes shifted or reduced to make room for him.

Murray’s uneven start to the season and partial redundancy with Westbrook make him an intriguing Sixth Man option, but the team is simply too financially invested in him to consider a bench role any time soon. It is tempting to give Westbrook a longer look as the sole ballhandler, however. Despite some obvious shooting limitations, the Westbrook/Braun/Porter/Gordon/Jokic lineup has an elite point differentials in its 210 possessions. It’s unclear how that would hold up in the long term, but it’s worth examining — and in fact, Westbrook played two more minutes than Murray in the team’s comeback win over Dallas yesterday.

Regardless of what happens with the starters, Malone will likely ride hot hands for closing lineups. He has traditionally preferred stability to experimentation, but this question is far from settled.

For a guy brought in with the lowest of expectations (and salary), Westbrook has been a revelation. But is he merely deepening their already-existing dilemma? Or can he be part of the solution? We won’t have a definitive answer for several months, but I’ll be eagerly watching to find out.",313,47,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i0ctna/russell_westbrook_problem_or_solution_oc_analysis/,2025-01-13 07:27:27,"Great write up, really interesting insights and ideas there.

I wanted to cover one particular point that stood out to me: how teams will be defending Westbrook with Jokic on the floor. You make a certainly valid argument that all big bodies have to stay on Jokic, so teams can’t camp their Cs against Westbrook like it happened in LA. 

That said, if a team has a big enough PF to not get completely overwhelmed by Jokic (OKC with both IHart and Chet on the floor together, Rockets, Memphis, Wolves and maybe even Mavericks - PJ has built a reputation to play above his size - and LA with LBJ potentially taking on Jokic assignment like he did in Olympics), they can still put a 5 on Westbrook in a somewhat free safety role and a big 4 on Jokic. I feel like Westbrook’s shooting limitations will be exposed by good West teams in playoffs unless he gets to that 35%+ on open 3s. || Thank you for the writeup! One point that I think should be highlighted is his current contract. He's awful with the Lakers because his production simply didn't match his contact size and they can't bring in help to address his shortcomings. In Denver the situation is the complete opposite - his production is way better than what his contract would indicate. He should be completing against end of bench players and he's obviously way better than that for Denver. His contract may be one of the best for non-stars in the league right now. || Jokic is a player that works well with Westbrook because they can play off each other's strengths on offense. 

Jokic can run a P&R or DHO as the initiator and Westbrook can roll/dive to the basket and finish close or play-make. 

Since Jokic is a shooting threat and a Center, bigs have to stay on him or give up a switch instead of crowding Westbrook's roll or cuts. 

Jokic is also really good on the short roll and rolling to the basket. So, at any time, they can invert the DHO or P&R where Jokic is the screener or cutter, and then Westbrook can attack with the ball when Jokic fades. They can also counter if Jokic creates a quick give-and-go by pulling a couple defenders in a direction with pass/shot fakes off of a Westbrook pass. 

They have enough counters as a duo to force the defense into ""pick your poison"" scenarios. They're both players that are dangerous in transition, too.

The big thing with Westbrook on offense is that the less you need him to shoot off the dribble (and shoot in general) on the perimeter, the better off you are. If you can have an offense with a handful of backup options, one of which is to just give Jokic the ball and let him create, you can ensure there are possessions that don't end in Westbrook taking a jumper late in the clock while the defense sags off of him. 

Murray is also able work with Jokic in the P&R/DHO inversion game as well, which can open up off-ball cuts and whatnot for Westbrook. This works even better if Murray is hitting shots because then both him and Jokic have to be guarded closely on the perimeter - opening things up for Westbrook to dive/cut to the paint. || Thanks for reading! Hopefully, you enjoyed reading something about Westbrook that didn't mention ""triple-double"" once! You can see all of the video GIFs [in-context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or).

The Russ fit has been more fun than I expected, and can't wait to see how it holds up as the season goes on. || I think one really important aspect is that while Russ might be reliant on Jokic, he also makes Jokic a significantly better and more scoring oriented player.

These are his PER 36 numbers with and without westbrook on the floor until Jan 8th:

Jokic with Westbrook off: 25/13/11 on 61% TS (+4 relative TS%) (497 mins)   
  
Jokic with Westbrook on: 34/12/9 on 65% TS (+8 relative TS%) (635 mins) || I think about the big reason for Russ ""returning"" to form comes from Jokic being the perfect player in NBA history to pair with Russ. He's a roll man who can fade, screen, and share high BB IQ. 

Furthermore, the Vet Min makes is easier to ignore bad games from him, as posted to LAL where it's easier to call him out when he's making a max and they gave up crucial role players for him. 

I do think this is going to be good for the Nuggets this year, but end up being bad. Russ is outplayed g his contract, so they'll either have to pay him more or  let him walk. Also, it would might convince the FO to stand pat since Russ puts a nice bandage on everything. || [removed] || Bravo.  

i haven’t seen enough Nuggets games recently, since Westbrook became a starter, but I can’t imagine a Nuggets team surviving without AG in the starting lineup come playoff time, so I can’t see them extending this WB experiment any longer. 

There was a back to back earlier this year for Denver, and Gordon played spectacularly during the first game. It wasn’t the points. He was grabbing all the (offensive) rebounds, and making all the plays they needed to win the game. Next day, they played another game, and AG looked gassed. He just wasn’t himself, and Denver lost that game badly. Nobody else was doing the dirty work that AG typically does, including Gordon himself, so they lost. 

Westbrook does some of that dirty work, but he’s not going to compete with other Cs and PF for rebounds when they’re swarming the basket, and consistently win those battles. || Love the mention of what Russ brings to this team with his mentality. He’s one of the best teammates in basketball, and even when his team is down or has some other issue, he’s still gonna bring intensity and energy and that’s infectious.  || Why no one is discussing Braun going to the bench????  i like this lineup:  Westbrook as 1; Murray 2; Porter Jr 3; Gordon 4 and Jokic the 5!!!!!!!!!!  Denver plays FASTER and BETTER with Westbrook in the starting lineup!!!!!!!!!💪👏 || I know this wasn't the main point but on that Wembanyama clip I'm just thinking ""Dude you are at least a foot taller than Westbrook, why are you trying to get the ball 20 feet from the hoop and then face up and drive past him?"" || This is just my opinion, but I feel like I didn’t learn a single thing. Not just a you thing, but I feel like 95% of basketball content is like this. It reads like you went onto a couple of the meta analytic sites, dove into some of the numbers. THEN found tape to back up the numbers. Maybe most people don’t notice that, but to me this just reads A.I light. Like If I asked google why the nuggets went on a 3 game winning streak & it would generate your post as a response. 

You aren’t telling us why things are happening, you’re kinda just taking the box score & dressing it up a lil bit & then spitting it back at us in a neat format. 

Like if I asked u why the Celtics are kinda teetering recently. I felt like u would go find a bunch of statistics & you could probably pin point the things they are & aren’t doing well statistically. But someone like Jason Timpf for example. Almost always talks about things happening on the court. & I don’t mean “the team scores x amount more per 100 possessions when player x is off the floor compared to on” he’s touching on all the factors CAUSING the player to struggle or thrive. There’s a million different nuance things that happen throughout a game, let alone a season. But it’s like now everyone is over looking or just completely blind to the nuances of basketball. The stats are just a second hand account of what is actually happening on the basketball court. I feel like people don’t understand that. 

The article just feels really really hollow. Like yeah, you noticed Russ has made an impact. You’ve found where he has made the impact STATISTICALLY. But you didn’t break down the xs & os at all. So much more could have been added imo. & when I say more could have been added, I don’t mean finding more stats. I don’t want u to punch in more lineup data into cleaningtheglass. I hope u get where im coming from. 

Go find a random video of Jason Timpf talking hoops, then come back to your article. You’ll know exactly what I mean. If you do that, you’ll notice your article is like a car that looks pretty nice on the outside. But if u popped the hood or opened the door it would just be the frame. It’s missing the meat & potatoes. || [removed] || I had a similar thought while writing that, and I think it's a good point. Ran out of word count to go that deep haha but it's definitely something to watch. || Mavs tried putting lively on Westbrook and then got burned for layups when they tried to double Jokic. I don't think teams are going to want to play with that many mismatches. A 4 on Jokic means a 3 on Gordon. I don't see that working consistently enough to even try that. || Yes but also worth considering is both forwards (Gordon and MPJ) are pretty big. Remains to be seen how effective they will be. || Yeah, I only briefly mention that because I pretty much ran out of room lol, but he's definitely a value signing given the sheer number of minutes he's playing. || Exactly this, and he's also had a few years to realize that he's just not that guy anymore, so now he's more familiar with his role and has been playing with more control than when he was with the Lakers. || Jokic is the perfect player for literally everyone ha, but it does feel especially so with Westbrook. I'm not sure Westbrook has earned himself a bigger payday. He *deserves* one, but it's very hard for guys his age who are already on a minimum to gain a pay bump. And how many teams can actually find a role for him in which he can be effective? Not many Jokic's out there.

But if he finds a way to make himself a positive in the playoffs, you never know. || Lol yeah I had a feeling I’d get something like that from people. But Westbrook is worth critically examining this season! || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || Thanks! Yeah, my best guess is that Westbrook keeps playing 30+ minutes, and Malone just tweaks the rotation to get him more with Jokic than before. 

Totally agree that Gordon is essential to Denver's success, although he hasn't been quite up to his usual standard this year defensively, IMO. Could just be health, though || Thanks for the feedback.  You made me think a little more critically about my article-building philosophy. Please let me know your thoughts:

Everything I do starts from watching ball. I try to hit four boxes with my player or team breakdowns: stats, film, analysis, engagement. The first two are easy as long as you're willing to actually watch a ton of games and not just do clips/highlights, etc. I try to let the eyes guide the stats I look at, but they work in tandem. Statistics are helpful for providing a framework for the discussion. Film clips are useful for illustrative purposes or for showing things that are tough to describe in words (e.g., Tosan Evbuomwan's funky push shot).

The third is the hardest, and what separates good content from great. I'm always trying to make sure I check that box, but I can only write what I learn, and sometimes I might just not hit a high enough level. Depending on the reader, it may hit home or it may not. I'm disappointed it missed the mark for you this time.

The fourth, engagement, is me trying to make sure the reader enjoys what they're reading. It can't be a bullet point of facts (I mean, it *could*, but then what value am I providing?). In my ideal world, my blogs are enlightening and entertaining. This one is hard to get right, too, but I'm mindful of it, at least.

It also needs to be at least a little approachable. As I mentioned, I write a blog, and I need to keep the audience in mind. For example, I can say that the Nuggets almost never run spain pick-and-rolls or double-drags, but I've tried stuff like that in the past and basically get booed off the stage by bored readers (or worse, crickets because nobody reads at all). So there's a fine balance.

Anyway, this was a long-winded way for me to say I'm always trying to get better, little bit by little bit. It's not an overnight change, but I look at where I started when I began writing, and I can at least see the progress. || CAPITAL LETTERS aren’t necessary to stress well constructed sentences and paragraphs. Please SEPARATE your comments into more clear PARAGRAPHS. || [deleted] || Mavs were +2 with Jokic and +3 with Westbrook on the floor in a -11 overall game: they just got - uncharacteristically for Nuggets opponents - destroyed by Denver’s bench. Mavs lost not because of Westbrook-Jokic connection, but because they went stagnant on offense themselves in Q4 due to Denver adjustments and missing 3s and then Dinwiddie iso-balling and opportunities generation is not anywhere close to Kyrie or Luka level.

Also playing Nuggets with AG and Westbrook on the floor together means the key would be to limit inside opportunities and sag off them on the perimeter since both are not great shooter. Nuggets can post up AG like they did vs Mavs (or like they did vs Heat in Finals), but I think most teams would be happy betting on that instead of having Jokic dissect their defenses: you just got to pick your poison vs great teams and I feel like that’s the best bet, plus somebody like J-Dub on AG may not be the end of the world, though he will be worn out defensively to produce much on offense for OKC. || I just hope a team doesn't get duped by this insane career turn around. || Could be, altho that’s rarer — Milwaukee, Memphis, maybe Lakers if they trade for a center. I do worry for Denver’s sake that defenses will find ways to punish the Nuggets non-shooters (not just Westbrook) in the playoffs. 

Thanks for clicking through! || Gordon had the best percentage from 3 on the team. Sagging off him isn't going to happen. Sagging off westbrook worked with the Rockets because he was basically the 5 so you cant be punished by guarding him with a 5. Against the mavs, their defense is better with Luka out. If he's playing there's nobody he could even guard. Playing the 5 on Westbrook means you have 5 mismatches on the court and that's just not going to work. || I think that most teams know Westbrook is in a situation that maximizes his strengths right now. And guys his age pretty much never bounce back from the minimum once they’re on it.

Denver might be the only such team at risk! || I mean I doubt anyone gives him more than 5mil a year at his age. He's essentially Heat Gary Payton imo || Duped might be the wrong word since whatever offer Russ gets with this kind of performance, he 100% deserves.

But I do get what you're saying, just look at Bruce Brown and KCP. Both were elevated by Jokic, both got their bag(kinda). || AG is currently 23-52 on 3s this year, so the sample size is rather small. At the same time, Gordon is a career 32% 3pt shooter over 10 seasons on more than 2000 attempts. Any serious coach would bet he regresses to his career average instead of becoming a 40%+ 3pt shooter over 1 offseason 10 years into his career. That may still backfire, of course (PJ Washington didn’t regress vs OKC who gave him that treatment - he would only do that in later series), but as I said, you got to pick your poison against elite offenses and I’d absolutely like to limit Jokic as much as possible.

One more thing: Mavs defense is statistically worse with Luka out of the lineup this year as Doncic has 109 DefRating (2nd on the team among players with 800+ minutes played behind Lively) and Mavs with Doncic on the bench have 111 DefRating. He is 81st percentile in D-EPM (+0.9, just behind Tatum) and is positive by D-LEBRON too. Doncic is not a defensive stopper by any means, but he is at worst a league average defender this year and is arguably even “good” defender.

In an extremely hypothetical scenario of Mavs vs Nuggets here, Doncic would be guarding whoever plays SF for Denver, Kyrie guards Murray (Grimes comes in to guard Murray whenever he plays) and then it is Klay and Naji guarding AG. Klay obviously lacks the size to limit AG much, but he is still most effective defensively vs bigger wings than at this point of his career and Naji absolutely loves to fight even if he may lack in defensive skill. AG may well average 20 in that case, but if most of the points come from his post-ups and Jokic is limited to something like 20-15-10, Mavs would be fine with that. || With the pick and roll we know what happens. Who ever has the ball is going to get the matchup they want. The team is either going to chase, trap or switch and the best option against Denver would probably be switching. If Luka switches on Westbrook thats a layup every time. The numbers you may see with Luka as far as defense are probably misleading. The mavs are just better with him on the floor regardless. Good offense leads to better defense. When you are scoring that means you aren't scrambling. Not a lot of transition defense being played. Mavs and lakers are the 2 teams i think really don't wanna see Denver at all in the playoffs and the lakers probably won't even get out the play-in. || What’s weird about AG is that he’s on 5 less minutes than last year and has only played 21 games this season, but is averaging significantly more 3s per game than last season. 

Funnily, last year was his worst 3pt shooting year since his first few seasons, at 29%, on 1.9 attempts per game while playing 73 games.

So what has him taking so many more 3s now? Personally, I think he worked on it in the offseason. 

Although, he’s now averaging 52.6% at home and 35% on the road, which is bizarre and I’m not sure if I’ve seen such a big difference before. Apparently that big of a discrepancy between is a career trend with him, looking at previous seasons.

Anyways, I could be wrong but assuming that he doesn’t significantly regress in 3pt%, how much does that change things for Denver? || If Doncic switches on Westbrook, he will simply stay away from him when guarding - how do you get a layup if Doncic is 7-10 feet away from Russ with 1 foot in the paint? Westbrook shot 30% (including 24% from 3pt range) in last year’s series vs Mavs, because he couldn’t exploit anyone since Dallas just left him alone to shoot from long range or middies. Doncic also knows his limitations as a defender and will not even try to contest Westbrook’s shots just daring a 32% 3pt shooter this season (30.5% for career) to score from range. I don’t think you realize how differently teams will play Russel in playoffs.

On the topic of not wanting to see Denver, Mavs are fine with that matchup: it is neither good nor bad. Dallas is usually destroyed by 5-out teams, but Denver plays AG and Westbrook - 2 sub-33% career 3pt shooters - 30+ minutes per game: that Dallas can deal with. The game is also played on 2 ends of the floor too, which means Denver will need Jamal Murray to chase Klay around the floor (assuming AG on Luka and Westbrook/Braun on Kyrie): I’m not completely sold he can do that for 30+ mpg per game and then provide 20+ ppg on the other end. The series won’t be as easy as Wolves were for Mavs, but it also would be an easier than last year’s Celtics or even this year’s OKC. || As much as PJ’s hot shooting changed Mavs vs OKC series: Denver does become a favorite to win, because hiding 1 bad shooter is easier than hiding 2.

That said, AG is now 24-59 for the season, which means he went 1-7 over the last week. I still think he drops to mid-30s by season end, which is serviceable, but wouldn’t be good enough for teams to overplay him on 3s. || Either you underestimate westbrooks speed or overestimate Lukas. Westbrooks just basically runs right passed him every time. I know how teams have tried to guard westbrook. For the lakers it worked because of AD and the rockets having no center. He kept the clippers close all by himself against the suns and then had a bad series the next year as did everyone else against Dallas. Mavs cant do what the lakers did because they don't have AD and it makes no sense to guard Jokic with small players just because Westbrook isn't a great shooter. || Thinking about this again, I'm not seeing how Mavs would get more than 1 game. AG career numbers aside, recently has been a way better shooter which doesn't even matter because thats not Denver offense. They are last in the league in 3PA. Number 1 in fast break points and their offense is 4th I believe and 1st in paint points possibly. Not sure what the matchups would be but looking at their recent game, it gets worse not better with Luka. If Lively stays with Westbrook, who is Luka guarding? AG? He's going to average 25 at least. Teams seem to be fine with conceding their mismatch with Jokic by creating more mismatches. The hope seems to be that Westbrook starts chucking up 3s. Michael Malone is too good for this to be a problem. || I wonder why Westbrook didn’t run past Mavs and Doncic in particular last year and instead settled to shoot jumpers for 34%TS. Hell, if we look at Westbrook’s career, he has 1 season of 54%+ TS (2009-10): league average TS% right now is 57%. In fact, Westbrook hasn’t been above league average in TS% in EITHER regular season or playoffs since 2016-17 season.

The tactic to defend Westbrook is just let him shoot 3s and not provide blowbye opportunities that he can still exploit. Last playoffs, for example, ALL Westbrook 3s were “wide open” per NBA.com: Mavs didn’t even try to close out on him to get to at least “open” type of shot. Yes, he is a great distributor and is handful with a head of steam, but that’s the whole point: stay near the paint so that he can’t really go by you with his speed or pass to an open man since the paint area is crowded. Unless Russel becomes a respectable shooter, Denver with Westbrook on the floor will be solved by quality teams. || Yes, and guess what part of offense translates the worst to playoffs? Yeah, you guessed it, fast break points. Mavs also coincidentally are an elite team when talking about turnovers: 2nd, 3rd, 3rd, 2nd, 4th in TOs per game since 19-20 season with Luka on ball. Even 24-25 year they were still top-10 before Luka got injured despite the fact Mavs by design were trying new things with Doncic offball. Those experiments would be over in playoffs, so good luck scoring in transition.

With fastbreak opportunities limited, Mavs would then crowd the paint and aim to force Denver to beat them from 3. That’s a very straightforward tactic due to how one dimensional Nuggets offense is because of the terrible roster construction and is a simple adjustment that most teams don’t do in regular season (why change the scheme for 1 game over an 82 games season?) but can absolutely do in playoffs. 

On who is guarding who: Luka would be guarding Braun or whoever else is playing SF, it would be Klay on AG. That’s a mismatch of course, but if Denver is playing constantly through AG post-ups, that’s a win in my book, especially with Lively providing help at the rim as a free safety off Westbrook. || You cant run passed anyone if you don't have the ball. || That is true, most of the time. Fortunately, Jokic and Westbrook are probably the best players in the league at creating fast breaks from made baskets. I don't know where you get this idea that their offense is one dimensional. They can do anything you can think of on offense. Jokic is the best player in the league so they don't need to chuck 3s like everyone else. No reason to do that when you can get all the points in the paint you want. 

As far as Dallas defensive game plan, if you have to double anyone other than Jokic, you already lost. That exactly why the lakers got swept. Hachimura couldn't guard AG so they put him on Jokic which was never going to work and they had to double and AG beat them anyway. Putting Lively on Westbrook might work if he was determined to stand at the 3 point line and just shoot those all day which is what he did on the clippers because he was the only playmaker. His cuts were pointless because he wouldn't get the ball. Now that's not an issue. Dallas' only chance is if Jamal doesn't show up, Westbrook goes rogue, or someone gets injured. Nuggets in 4½."

My stats were taken from StatMuse, NBA.com and Basketball Reference.

I took some of the best scorers of our time, clearly the most prolific ones such as MJ, Kobe Harden ( a well known free throw marchant), Doncic and LeBron averaged just the same free throw attempts as SGA yet they're not called free-throw marchants although when watching games James and Doncic tend to flop.

 Considering that most of SGA scoring attempts are either the ISO or Drive especially with his weird playing style a lot of defenders tend to lean their bodies more into SGA and he also initiates a lot of contact in order to get some space in his shot creation but it seems a lot of his critics do not actually watch his games and also don't bring up actual stats like I have. This is r/NBA discussion so I'm down to have people refute my stats and facts by having a debate like thoughtful individuals. Peace to you all.

His midrange jumpers (and now 3s) are so consistent, defenders cannot give space and he uses that to his advantage. But I think SGA also plays up to his somewhat lean frame in creating contact and selling fouls more than tanks like LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard || SGA critics will always make it about how he gets his FTA's, not how many he gets. Much easier to do mental gymnastics that way. If you cite averages, they'll say he foul baits more against good teams. If you say he dropped 40 with 5 FTA against the Cavs, they'll ignore you and link a clip of him exaggerating contact that you could find if you search for any great player's name + ""flop"". || [removed] || [removed] || Anyone who calls anyone a free-throw merchant is just not a serious fan of basketball. Drawing fouls is an intelligent thing to do, and it’s as valuable a skill as there is. You put your opponent on the back foot, make it so that they have to play worse defense to stay out of foul trouble, and you get easy shots. || Someone like Shai who’s learned to play the Canadian brand of basketball was never taught to have the same kind of dawg that Americans have. Hence why the top floppers/free throw merchants are all foreign born players. || He does lean head first into defenders a lot then snaps his head back. I don’t like to watch it because it’s so obvious but you can’t even blame sga for doing it if the officials keep rewarding it. || Exactly, at this point there's no reason to respond to them. He dropped 37points out of 54 points last night yet they bring up the free throws all the time. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || Please keep your comments civil. This is a subreddit for thoughtful discussion and debate, not aggressive and argumentative content. || Yeah, don’t hate the player hate the game. 

If they want to change the foul system, then change it. The reduction of shooting fouls has been better. || Foul baiting is putting the game in the hands of the referee, not playing basketball. I would love to see a sharp increase in offensive fouls called when an offensive player blatantly baits the defender. This is like in the NFL if an offensive lineman was able to do a false start at will but the defender gets called for offsides the moment they take the bait. Yes, there is a fine line between this and the early 2000's 95 point slugfests. Neither are good. But we shouldn't advocate for one because we are so afraid of the other. || But in this very sub Embiid gets hate for baiting fouls || [removed] || Dude played in the States too lol. How can you talk about the Canadian hoop scene without having watched it? It's funny you say that because another international player will be MVP and this has been ongoing for the past 6 years now and Canadian and European players have caught up to Americans because of basic understanding of the fundamentals of Basketball which Americans lack but eh in your minds you think you're greater than the world || Then you always hear the audible ""OHHH!"" when he feels any sort of contact.

Not hating on the guy, lots of other players do it.  But now I can't *not* hear it. || He certainly exaggerates contact, just like every good NBA scorer. People have just fixated on clips of the egregious head snaps he's done in the past because it looks especially dumb, and confirmation bias does rest. I'm a biased homer, so I find the FT merchant accusations hilarious because I'd say the more legit critique of SGA is offensive fouling with his arm clears and shoulder bumps. Even then, it's debatable, and not anything that MJ or Kobe didn't use to the same degree. Only thing he can do at this point is win a title tbh. Without the hardware, it's a lot easier to disregard how legit his game is. || I’m not against a slight change in the rules to allow more physicality, but it’s a real fine line. The last time they allowed more physicality (ie hand checking) it helped deflate overall scoring, which absolutely is more boring than watching a dozen or so extra free throws per game. || Foul baiting isn’t real. It’s called “the defender put themselves in a bad/aggressive defensive position and the offensive player took advantage.” For example, the Embiid rip through. If you are going to extend your hands into the offensive player’s space, and they then move a body part within their space to where it makes contact, the refs are rightfully going to call a reach in foul. Another one I see people complain about is when Trae Young drives and then stops on a dime to get the trailing defender to run into him. The defender is in the wrong 100% of the time. Young is in his own space, if he stops, the defender also has to stop before he makes contact. If players don’t want to get called for a foul, they have to play less aggressive defense. However, that has its own risks. || I'll go long on this someday, but do we really think that if ""you don't get cheap fouls, but you can grab people and elbow them in the chest really hard and you won't get called for it"" that Joel Embiid, who is 7'1 and weighs 280, is all of a sudden going to be completely helpless? Sure, he gets injured a lot, but that's from all that weight moving very fast on ligaments that aren't built to do that, not an elbow going into his chest. For 98% of NBA players, I'm betting ""you can elbow him, but he gets to elbow you back"" ends badly for the other guy when Joel Embiid is involved. 

At the end of the day, I feel like Joel Embiid would be able to learn how to elbow people and get elbowed a lot faster than Bill Wennington would be able to learn how to hit threes and hit a crossover into a fadeaway from the high post, ya know? || Embiid is a big man and has a PPG dropoff so bad in the playoffs that it actually [broke records](https://fadeawayworld.net/joel-embiid-had-the-largest-ppg-drop-in-the-playoffs-for-an-mvp-in-nba-history) for an MVP calibre player. A good amount of that dropoff is from his foulbaiting habits in the regular season. 

Shai is a smaller player and yet doesn’t seem as reliant on baiting fouls to generate points. || And that’s also ridiculous. Again, I personally will never give a player crap for trying to get to the line. I did it when I played because it was the right move to make from a basic strategic level. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || It’s not a cheap way of playing the game. It’s an intelligent way to play the game. If you don’t foul them, you don’t send them to the line, but that requires playing straight up defense. Players like Luka, Embiid, Trae Young, and SGA are good enough to where you can’t do that. None of these guys are talentless bums who can only shoot free throws. If they aren’t drawing fouls from overly exuberant defending, they’ll find another way to score. They just take advantage of the fact that they can’t be played straight up, and that’s just smart basketball. || Adam Silver has allowed foreigners to turn the NBA to a soap opera, please || Agreed. Totally.  And I love that they got rid of the leg kick and such. But overall my problem is the refs have too much to do with the game. It’s too front and center. But it is what it is unless they change it. || If foul baiting isn't real, then why do we have some of these quotes? To be clear, some are sour grapes, but still...

>""The way we're teaching the officials, we're just enabling players to BS their way to the foul line.""

>""We have enabled the players, and they are taking full advantage. It's a parade to the free-throw line, and it's disgusting to watch.""

\-Steve Kerr. It was after a loss, but still...another quote from him, after a loss as well, where he even mentions this in regard to his own star player:

>""I love what I'm seeing. I think the officials are doing a great job. The game has more of an authentic feel. You are seeing some players draw fouls that maybe they would have gotten the last few years, and they are not being rewarded for that.""

>""I think there's a purity to it that I'm seeing. We even saw Steph, a couple of times pump fake, start to jump into his guy and then realize, ""Oh I'm not going to get that,"" and he moves the ball on.""



>“Last year, there was an adjustment,” Silver began. “Part of it was a response to the basketball community that they felt we were allowing players to hunt for fouls, particularly in certain offensive plays were not traditional basketball plays.

\-Adam Silver. He does say it is in response to the basketball community. But that doesn't just include fans.

\-A tweet from NBA Official [https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/news-we-re-getting-rid-nonsense-golden-state-warriors-head-coach-steve-kerr-applauds-referees-giving-foul-baiting-tactics](https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/news-we-re-getting-rid-nonsense-golden-state-warriors-head-coach-steve-kerr-applauds-referees-giving-foul-baiting-tactics)

So yeah, I'm calling nonsense on the idea that foul baiting isn't real. It's just another way to flop without hitting the floor.

As far as the rip move: The defender is not initiating the contact on the rip through move, though. And replays often show the offensive player making the move to initiate contact, not to make a basketball play. And some videos will show Embiid actually locking the opponent's arm so they can't get away thus drawing the foul. As for Trae letting a defender run into him: is he trying to make a basketball play, or get the refs to call the whistle? The way you word it you even admit he does it to get the defender to run into him. || Gilbert Arenas brain rot effects are very visible on you. Rodman was one of the biggest floppers I've ever seen. He flopped just as much as Divac but you probably view him as a tough American and symbol of physical 90s-early 00s game. Get a reality check. || That’s just the nature of basketball. It’s a fast moving, physical game that paradoxically does not allow contact, so the rules have to draw the line somewhere and the refs are given the extremely difficult task of deciding what is and isn’t a foul."
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-01-23,nbadiscussion,1i82vg6,System-Creating Stars vs. System-Dependent Stars: What do you value more?,"Throughout NBA history, we've seen contrasting types of star players who impact winning in different ways. Today, I'd like to know your opinion, what do you value more?

System-Creating Stars: Players who dominate the offense through high usage rates and playmaking (LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Jokic). These players essentially become the offensive system themselves, bending team strategies around their unique skillsets.

System-Dependent Stars: Players who excel within established systems, often through off-ball movement and efficient scoring (Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant). These stars can elevate existing systems to championship levels through their ability to maximize team concepts.

In my opinion, system-dependent stars provide more team-building flexibility and sustainable success. When examining team construction, system-creating stars often require specific roster builds - like how Westbrook needed shooters (OKC peaked with 47.6 TS% as a team when surrounded by athletes), Harden's Rockets required specific role players for his isolation style (Houston built entirely around 3&D players), and even LeBron's teams traditionally need particular archetypes of players to maximize his drive-and-kick game. In contrast, system-dependent stars like Curry (Warriors maintain a 58.2 TS% with various roster iterations), Durant (has excelled in three different systems: OKC, GSW, and Phoenix), and Jordan (thrived both pre and post-triangle) have shown remarkable adaptability to different teammates and schemes while maintaining elite efficiency. This adaptability often makes it easier for front offices to build and maintain competitive rosters around them, as they can succeed with a wider variety of teammate archetypes.

What's your perspective on which type of star player provides more value to a team's success? Does the ability to adapt to any system outweigh the specialized excellence within a specific system?",8,28,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i82vg6/systemcreating_stars_vs_systemdependent_stars/,2025-01-23 08:03:54,"Do you not think that Stephen Curry being such a great Offball player creates a new system ?  I don't see how he is system dependent when he is the reason that system works in the first place ? || I kind of hate this. Talent is talent. Putting a narrative spin on it diminishes the talent.

Like is Tim Duncan relegated to a system star just because he only played for the Spurs. Why is Jokic considered a system creating star since he also has only played for one team...how do we know that without Mike Malone he'd be as effective.

It just all feels arbitrary. I think when you have star talent, it's easy to recognize... system be damned. || Jordan Durant and curry are system dependent when nobody else without them can play anything resembling that system. Alright man. Let me take a wild wild guess who your favorite player is || I feel like generally both options are valid. The problem is if you can build a roster that will fit together. Is your GM good enough?

  
However if we would be talking to guys with the level of Curry and above i feel like the guy is so specialized and so good at what he's good at, that you can and should build a team and system around his skillset, and its going to work great.   
So i would say system dependant stars are generally better than players who create the system.  


I see the Bulls and Warriors as the same team on different eras.

In the Warriors you had Curry as the main offensive weapon, Klay as a backup, Draymond on D and rebounding.

In the bulls you had MJ as the main offensive guy, Pippen as a backup, and Rodman.

  
Sure, the offensive runs different, the players are different (i would say MJ can score in many more ways than Curry, Pippen is probably a worse scorer than Klay was in his prime, but a better defender, and Draymond is similar to Rodman), but the fundamentals are the same.   
You have 1 main guy, and build everything else to adapt to his skills. The main guy is the primary scorer, and has a secondary scorer to drop 15-25 points. A third man focused on defense and rebounding. || [removed] || this is a bad take imo. Stars are the system and not a single star player is system dependent. Harden was great in any system he was just at his best with the ball in his hand. Steph curry is great off ball sure but their best play was always the steph damond pick and roll with him running down the court at full speed handling the ball. Jordan averaged 30 ppg and carried his team to the playoffs long before the triangle offense. the “system dependent” is when a system is implemented around stars that allow the role players to better play with the stars. Stars don’t need systems role players need systems to adapt to the stars. || By your own admission guys like harden and Westbrook needed specific players to have success, I’d argue that’s actually being system dependent. As for Lebron he’s won championships with three different teams three different coaches, a non shooting star guard in Dwayne wade, with two non shooting bigs playing long stretches at the same time in 2020 and playing at the 4 more in Miami than he did in Cleveland. I don’t think that’s system dependent || You need a balance between the system revolving around the stars, for system creating stars injury to the star can completely turn the season upside down, take luka doncic and mavs currently. James harden is also an example, once he was shut down during the playoffs by the opposing defense the offense breaks down. the team needs a system that excels with the star and can function upto an extent without the star. golden state is an example, the systems efficiency of the system is highly dependent on the shooting presence. Better the shooting, better the system, with steph curry the system is at a peak but still can work with average shooters to an extent. Durant I would say is an exception due to his ability to play any systems, any position or any type of game. He would be the most complete player.  
So I would prefer a system which can function without its star (due to injury or when he is shut down by the opposing defense) and excels the best with its star. The best squad I would say consists of a rim protector that can at least shoot free throws, a point guard that can play off the ball if needed and other 3 and D wings among whom at least two can create their own shot and can switch 1 to 4 and at least hold their ground against big large centers until double comes || Jokic has played well with anyone including even Westbrook. He creates the system, yes, but the system he creates he tailors to the strengths of his teammates. He might be an anomaly though  || Your examples that define system dependent players are incorrect. I’m not sure it’s worth going down this discussion when your basic premise can’t even support evidence. || yeah i think the post didnt consider that a player can be the system without him having the bulk of playmaking duty. Warriors' success with motion offense was dependent on curry, not the other way around || Ya Steph has a lot of gravity with or without the ball || Yeah, under Mark Jackson he was really a traditional point guard. Heavy on PNR, pull-up mid and pass. I'd argue when he became a system-dependent player and trusted Steve Kerr's offense he transcended into superstardom || The system works without Steph too. Gsw routinely wins games without Steph playing || Seems like a useless semantic distinction to me, if not a pointless over-complication growing out of Harden’s random “I am the system” boast. So take Harden, who is supposedly system “creating” but not “depending,” when his success has only ever come within a heliocentric style? 

Like I think there’s a valid conversation to be had about stars with various level of ball dominance and flexibility, but “system creating/depending”? Gto || Pippen may not have been capable of going nuclear like klay, but I'd argue he was a more well-rounded scorer with a deeper bag. Your points are still great as far as comparing the two teams. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || Not to mention Durant's entire time at okc was plagued by systemless basketall. Pure iso hero ball traded between Russell and KD. A player of that caliber can and often is both the key reason for the system and the main option to go away from said system. || Yeah except stephs best scoring moments all come when we abandon the movement system and give him the ball. The end of the 21season, the 2019 playoffs after KD goes down, the 22 finals.

Steph transcended to superstardom because his game matured and he increased the volume of his pull up 3s. || I don't see that system winning 4 championships without Steph at the head. I am sorry, I just do not. || In Steph’s career, Warriors are 89-150 without him. They do not routinely win games without him. Even in the KD era, with Steph out and KD/Klay in, they were merely a .500 team. Steph IS the system. || >Like I think there’s a valid conversation to be had about stars with various level of ball dominance and flexibility

Bingo - the conversation really needs to be the other way around. How does a star player impact a system?

 Like Jordan, pippen, Kobe, and melo were stars who all played in the triangle and coached by Phil Jackson. 

We can certainly talk about how each performed in the system, but to suggest that Jordan and Kobe succeeded because they are system dependent and melo didn't because...what... he is the system? makes no sense.

Jordan's best statistical season was without Phil and the triangle...but OP arbitrarily put him as a system dependent player...none of that makes sense. || How??? Pippen relied heavily on his athleticism to score. Was worse bad midrange shooter compared to Klay and his best 3pt shooting years correlate exactly with the shortened 3pt line.

(Shooting data only exists from 96-97 onwards however Klay did come back from major injuries) || I was talking about now. They 5-3 without him this season || Those are fair points. I just feel like he was a more well-rounded scorer. He wasn't necessarily a better one. I did say that, though, to begin with. Like Klay is responsible for some major scoring games. || Lmfao bruh “your sample size of 3 full seasons worth of games is no match for my sample size of 8 games” 😂 || Yeah I can get that. I feel like if you want specifically an extra scorer Klay is the better option. However Klay couldn’t be the number 1 option like Scottie was in 93-94."
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-01-27,nbadiscussion,1ic2mtz,"No, it's not recency bias, Jokic is that good.","This season, Jokic is currently averaging 30.3/13.1/10.2, putting him 3rd in scoring, 3rd in rebounding, and 2nd in assists. Meanwhile he is averaging 65.7% TS, making him the 2nd most efficient volume scorer (players scoring at least 20.0 ppg), behind only Sabonis. Oh yeah and he's the third most efficient 3 point shooter in the league hitting 47.4% of his attempts. That is a mind bogglingly impressive box score. You could very seriously  argue that Jokic is the only player in NBA history to simultaneously be the best scorer, play maker, and rebounder in the world.

Throughout NBA history, there have been exactly 5 individual season where an individual recorded a BMP of 13.0 or higher. 1 was LeBron in 2008-09, the other 4 were all Jokic. This season he is on pace to break his own record, with a BMP of 14.23.  Yes, BMP can be a flawed stat, but the individuals with top 10 BMP seasons not named Jokic are Michael Jordan (3 times), LeBron James (once), and Steph Curry (once). That is a very, very good list to be a part of.

My last point is that off of vibes I've gotten watching basketball over the last few years is that it has felt like Jokic has been the best basketball player in the world for the last 4 years . How many all time greats over the  last several decades could really claim to have been the best player in the league for 4+ years? Not many. MJ, LeBron, Kareem. Maybe, Shaq, Magic or Tim Duncan.  

  
My point is, that Jokic is that guy. Not only is he awesome, he is historically awesome. It is not ridiculous to consider him to be amongst the greatest centers to ever live, and you should not dismiss him simply because his team didn't win a team award as often as others.",867,316,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ic2mtz/no_its_not_recency_bias_jokic_is_that_good/,2025-01-28 09:22:34,"This post is mostly focused on defining the abilities of a single player, which is great. Unfortunately, the comments focusing on ranking that player, got rapidly uncivil and focused on measuring egos instead of sharing insights. 

Post can remain as an exception to our rules but comments are locked. || Peak-for-peak he has a pretty good case for being the best offensive player ever. I would also say he has a top 10 peak of all-time.

We don’t need to jump the gun on career discussions for him though. It’s not just a rings thing, it’s longevity too. Most guys in that top 12 range have 12+ years of elite play. Jokić has only been star-caliber for 7-8 years. He’ll naturally get his due as his career progresses. || I might be early but for me he’s the best centre I’ve ever seen, I didn’t get to see all of Shaq’s prime but i only remember the later years. Jokic didn’t play with Kobe or D Wade either, even his co star can be inconsistent but there’s no doubt he makes almost everyone a better player, look at Russ this season for example. || Definitely not arguing with the title, but pulling up stats are kind of pointless. Efficiency stats when comparing eras just don't make sense. And the reason his BPM is so historic is the team is appalingly bad when he is not on the court. Now that usually happens when you have a superstar because the rest of the team is cramped with the salary cap. When salaries weren't as crazy in the 70s/80s, teams always had built out rosters. So you didn't see teams cratering when the star was off the court like you do in the Lebron/Steph/Jokic era.

  
Again, I think he's historically great. To crack the GOAT tier discussion, he'll need to win a few more championships. May not be fair to him in the era of parity, but those are the breaks. || The only pushback I’d give is that I don’t think Jokic was the consensus best player in the league until 2023.  A lot of people had Giannis over him until the 2023 title run.  Now of course we can just argue that’s due to winning bias (I’m not sure Jokic got appreciably better between 2022 and 2023, his team was just better), I’m just saying idk if it’s fair to say he’s been the consensus best player for the last 4 seasons.  There were lots of questions about his defense and how well it would hold up in the playoffs. 

He has been a top 3 player for the last 3-4 seasons though, and he’s in the midst of one of the greatest peaks we’ve ever seen. || [removed] || Yeah and he's 4th in steals too with a great assist to turnover ratio. It's actually crazy || Jokic has highest 3 point percentage cause he actually has around 15 heaves this season, if not for those he would would be above 50% || The only thing that matters is championships.   That's it!

He's got one which definitely helps his cause.   If he didn't win one,   I would put him in a different category with Malone or Barkley. || Agree.

I've watched NBA on and off for 35 years and both the eye test and the stats are in agreement, he is a generational big man. As long as he stays healthy and reproduces his current form for a decent number of years he is on track to finish his career as one of the ten greatest players of all time.

Trying to rank him against other all time greats is dificult for the same reason Bird is tough to rank- joker is just so fucking perfect offensively that it papers over any other cracks in his game. || His peak could still be going for few more years
He doesn’t rely on being athletic he only falls off when his focus is off || Agreed with most the comments he is the best offensive player ever

And I would say His defence isn’t elite, but it’s definitely underrated || He has a great case obviously 



I diminish jokic from greats simply because...


DEFENSE.


Bill Russell 11 rings DEFENSE 
Shaq DEFENSE 
Hakeem DEFENSE 
Kareem DEFENSE 
Duncan DEFENSE 
Wilt DEFENSE 


Jokic has a great case but there is a reason when we talk top 5 any position or top 5 centers they all have DEFENSE || Just going to add that if you removed end of the quarter heaves, which Jokic leads the league in, then I believe he is the most efficient 3 point shooter in the league. || [removed] || He is on a five year run that is at least ARGUABLY better than anyone else’s. And the years before his numbers were still all nba level. At some we have accept that super efficient scoring, wonder passing and dominant rebounding combined with the most team oriented mindset possible probably will make you a legendary player. I think he’s better at the game than Magic or Bird. We are watching a phenomenal player in his prime. In the same way as I accepted Steph was the GOAT shooter quite early in his career I now accept that Denver had a top 10 player of all time. Things improve and people get better at playing games it’s only to be expected that a 2025 player might  do some things that weren’t being done in 05 or 95. I think we should all enjoy it. || Giannis is right there with him if not better. Defense is a thing in the NBA. || Comparing players across eras is dumb especially if you don't have a clear cut criteria. Plus anything you judge a player on is based around their teammates rather it's stats, awards or winning everything is skewed by how good or bad your teammates are and the fit put around the best player. || Yep. We’re watching a basketball savant. He’s the most bizarre super talent I’ve ever seem. Incredibly limited athletically in a sport that rewards athleticism as much as any sport, but his IQ, size, strength, vision, hand eye coordination, mentality, and work ethic are all off the charts elite.

if joker had a competent FO behind him he would already have 4 rings. their best value signing in Westbrook was JOKER's  idea ! dude is a better GM than his own GM || “Because his team didn’t win a team award as often as others”? He has more mvps than conference finals appearances lol. You can’t put him in the same category as MJ, lebron, Kareem, Shaq, magic, and Tim Duncan yet.

And I’d argue that the best player in the league on the best team the past 4+ years has been Tatum. Deep playoff runs every year. || You guys know when you make your best players ever that you don't really have to include players like pre 80s even pre 90s, it's not like you saw Bill Russell so why would I put him in my top ten. Make your own top 10 with what you know, dont be a sheep || [removed] || Ok, let's discuss. 

Yes, Jokic is that good, for all the statistical reasons you listed... And, he did finally lead his team to a very elusive title, and has a good amount of accolades. 
But, what does that mean?

A lot of the NFL world seems ready to crown Patrick mahomes the goat, for potentially winning 3 super bowls in a row. Why? Cuz there, they understand the importance of winning, over statistical achievements. 
Yes, the NFL is different, and due to winner take all playoff formats, it's harder to win 3 in a row. I'll give you all of that. 

Bringing it back to the NBA... What criticism is often levied against Wilt Chamberlain, for his goat case? He didn't win enough. I can provide all sorts of context and history, regarding the Bill Russell superteams, and lack of free agency and post injury Wilt and blah blah... But, at the end of the day, he didn't get it done, despite his ridiculous list of all time records (which are even smaller than they should be, cuz certain stats weren't even counted when he played...)

Winning matters, is the point. It shouldn't be your end all, be all... But, it matters. 

And in that category, we need to pump the brakes a little bit for Jokic.

Then there's the recency bias issue, of trying to put the proper context around Jokic in this era, and trying to compare that to previous era's---which is already a fools errand in many ways. But, the entire play style of the league is very different. The rules are different. Positionless basketball is a very new concept. Centers of the past trained their entire lives to play in those styles and systems. David Robinson is a GREAT center---but recency bias, stats, and analytics will never give him the credit he deserves. They also won't add any context or history, of him consistently playing against other great centers. 

Your comparing a guy, with an insane usage rate, in a positionless league, who has the ball in his hands all the time, and basically makes all the decisions on the floor... To players of the past, that had roles, played in systems, were generally less ball dominant, etc, had to rely on point guards to get them the ball, where high scoring point guards were anomalies... These are the areas where recency bias will tell you Jokic is ""SO MUCH BETTER"" than everyone before... When it's more complicated than that. 

Also, it's an inflated era. The commissioner has admitted, on camera, rules were changed intentionally to make scoring easier. Pace and more 3s makes it easier for rebound opportunities, and not just for centers anymore. There's no physicality in the league. Assists are given out like candy now. Freedom of movement and carrying/lack of travels makes it easier for everyone... The spacing has never been so wide open... The center position has NEVER been so physically weak, out of necessity, to keep up with modern offenses.

So ya... Admire what he's doing. But no, he's not goat center yet, he's not top 15 already...

Damn... Let his have his career. Recency bias and analytics are frothing at the mouth to put all these players right now in goat conversations and put them as all time greats, before they've even put in the real work. || Not Magic for 4 years. Bird though for sure 

3 MVP
5 runner ups in 8 years || My only contention with his placements among the offensive goats is his slight playoff dip. I'd expect a guy with his regular season profile to either have LeBron or Jordan relative box score numbers, or goat level impact data, but he doesn't have either of those, in the playoffs. || Stats aren't everything. He has great stats-- legendary stats, the best stats--yes. And he can make a team better when he's the focal point.

But beyond that, he lacks a lot of the traits that ""the best player in the world"" should have:

* the ability to take over games and series, night in, night out
* the ability to carry a team much farther than they would go otherwise
* excellent defense
* dominating his fellow stars in at least one All-Star game
* helping his team win multiple rings (still to be decided)
* the dominant ""Shaq effect"" that makes he and his team feel unbeatable 
* the killer approach of MJ
* the all-around dominance of prime Bron

He looks like ""one of the best,"" but not ""the best."" Right now, SGA is who really impresses me. || If Embiid never got hurt last year then he would have ran away with the MVP again. Why isn’t that talked about? || I think he's currently the best player in the league, and has been for the last 3-4 seasons.

  
His passing (better than LeBron's), footwork (great fundamentals), and shooting (both midrange and 3p) are elite. The only thing holding him back is that he isnt athletic, but he is strong and has immense stamina. || Jokic is just like Wilt Chamberlain. Does everything except win championships || Idk, try maybe not blowing a lead to the sub .500 Bulls right after getting blown out by the .500 Twolves. || Assuming he has the longevity, he's going to get boned on the championship thing. IMO the level of talent in the NBA is so much higher than any other era. The age defying feats of LBJ/Steph/Durant may be coming to an end, but the parity (also due to CBA changes) is astounding.

I don't know if he will be able to get another ring and thats just not fair. But those are the breaks. || ^^^ On the alltime lists is where Jokic sometimes gets overhyped. He's not a top 15 player yet, every other player in the top 20 has several more years of star play on their resume. Assuming health he's on pace to retire top 10, but we shouldn't be crowning him based on a hypothetical. || Yep. If his first 10 match the second 10, he's not just top 10 but top 3. But we'll see if he maintains his pace. Still lots of basketball to be played. || Most elite guys virtually guaranteed a team 50-wins, for the majority of their prime. We have to consider the fact that maybe, his lack of rim protection makes him contribute less to winning than other all-time greats. || We can’t deny that Jamal Murray played at a superstar level in that championship run though. He was completely unstoppable alongside Jokic. Jokic is definitely the best Center of the last 15 or so years. But when you look at the sheer two way dominance of guys like Hakeem especially, and Shaq, it’s impossible to put Jokic above them all time rn. || BPM weighs certain statistics differently by position, and Jokic's statistical profile has his stats weighted for a SF/PF hybrid, if I recall correctly. His assists become extremely valuable and count towards his DBPM, which has overvalued him insanely on that end. 

I think BPM is going to need another recalibration, the way they had to do it for Westbrook's rebounding numbers. It's just not putting out the correct value for Jokic's contributions on the defensive end.

Jokic is clearly a top 20 all-time player already, and his peak is astronomical offensively, but I agree that we're going to have a statistical reckoning in the near future that will give us a little better perspective. || >Efficiency stats when comparing eras just don't make sense.

Using raw numbers can be a little dangerous since efficiency has gone up over the years, but it's not hard to adjust for era. Very few players have been as efficient as Jokic on as high of volume for as long as him.

>And the reason his BPM is so historic is the team is appalingly bad when he is not on the court.

I don't think BPM is a great way to judge a player's impact, but it's a box-score based stat; it doesn't look at how a player or his team performs on vs off the court.

>Now that usually happens when you have a superstar because the rest of the team is cramped with the salary cap. So you didn't see teams cratering when the star was off the court like you do in the Lebron/Steph/Jokic era.

Even if on/off data is inflated in recent years compared to the 70s/80s, Jokic is still off the charts.

Here are the highest 3-year on/off stretches for some contemporaries:

Player | On/Off | Years
---------|----------|--------
Jokic | +21 | 23-25
Curry | +18.6| 14-16
LeBron| +16.5| 15-17
Embiid| +11.2| 21-23
Giannis|+10.1| 18-20
Harden|+7.8| 14-16
Luka | +7.5 | 23-25

>To crack the GOAT tier discussion, he'll need to win a few more championships. May not be fair to him in the era of parity, but those are the breaks.

Why? Championships are a team effort. If we're talking about the best *player*, why judge them based off of a binary stat that requires a good team? || I meaaannnn, Lebron had dogshit Cavs, Jordan had pretty awful early Bulls, Luka Mavs, Kobe Lakers, etc, they all had to carry, he just clearly, 100%, carries better than all of em, no? || if all the stars in the past had way better teammates then wouldn't that also mean it was easier for them to win championships? || You're right that sky-high BPMs happen when you have a superstar because the rest of the team is cramped with the salary cap, but that doesn't explain why Jokic's BPM still surpasses all those other historical superstars (peak MJ, peak Bron, '16 Steph, etc).

(I also agree that multiple championships and Finals MVPs are table stakes for getting into the GOAT discussion, fair or not) || [removed] || But Giannis was in discussions for becoming possibly a top 10 all time player if he kept up his success. Then Jokic came into his own and was even *better* than Giannis, and now no one talks about Giannis as a potentional top 10 player anymore. || [removed] || He's been the best player for the last 4 years. It's his 5th. Stops this ""discussion"" nonsense, that's just the media, because no one would watch, if they just went ""yup...Jok is no1, there ain't really clear no2, sry"".

I agree with you on everything but this is the most important part. Joker is literally ""basketball essence"", he plays the game the way it should be played. || I don’t understand your MVP argument. So what Embiid won an MVP? LeBron didn’t win an MVP every year either, but he was clearly the best player in the league || Tatum is clearly not the best player in the league. He plays on a stacked team so the team is really good but there is no reason to bring him up in a conversation for the best player in the league. || Embiid won an MVP that he should never have won. I agree with the rest thou. || Is Bill Russel your goat? Has any player ever won multiple rings without ever playing with all star teammate? No, because basketball is a team sport. No player has ever had such a large discrepancy in his team’s success in the minutes he plays compared to the minutes he sits, so don’t try and pretend he doesn’t impact winning. || Our sub is for in-depth discussion. Low-effort comments or stating opinions as facts are not permitted. Please support your opinions with well-reasoned arguments, including stats and facts as applicable. || Let me ask you this, can you name me one NBA player in history with multiple NBA titles who never played with a single all star? No you can’t. Sure, a few of the Nuggets teams constructed over the years have actually had very solid supporting casts, but solid supporting casts rarely win championships. You could seriously argue the 2022 Nuggets were the worst supporting cast to ever reach the playoffs. In addition to never have an awesome second option many of the Nuggets teams have also lacked depth. The only real exceptions were 2020 and 2023, where shocker they went to the conference finals before losing the eventual champions and won it all respectively. || That’s just straight up, verifiably untrue. Last season he averaged 28.7/13.4/8.7 on 62.5% TS in the post season. The season prior he averaged 30/13.5/9.5 on 63.1% TS in the playoffs. The season before that he’s averaged 31/13.5/5.8 on 64.3% TS. Even his first season in the playoffs all the way back in 2019 he averaged 24.5/13.0/8.4 on 
59.6% TS. He has also lead the league in post season PER 4 out of his 6 playoff appearances, and post season BMP 3 times as well. The Nuggets have legitimately never lost a playoff series become of Jokic. || I think his level of excellence put him above SGA but i agree that there is a kinda  ""numeracy bias"" to saying he's the best player in the world or even among the best of all time.  It is obvious to me that he's the most versatile offensive player of all time, in that he is a first option scorer who can face up and post up, shoot the midrange, stretch the floor and hit free throws, while at the same time carve up defenses with making the right reads.  In that way, he's the Michael Jordan of centers.  The difficulty of Joker's excellence is two-fold.  Great players rise in the big moments.  But the best of all meet what the moment requires.  So LeBron most memorable play was a block and MJs most memorable play was a two for one where he stole the ball from an MVP.  Players like Jokic and Steph have to have a really improbable level of excellence on the offensive end to offset what liabilities they sometimes present on the defensive end.  That's just life.

But the second thing is: being the greatest really is more than winning championships or having massive stats.  It comes down to those intangibles, the act of building the legend.  That's the hardest part and not only is it particularly hard for players like Duncan and Jokic, those are two guys that couldn't care less about their legend.  Kids right now are jacking up threes believing they are Steph.  Shimmying into a free throw like KD.  People are yelling Kobe's name throwing something in the trash.  And people are doing fadeaways that they shouldn't even have tried because of MJ and MJ copied Jerry West and Elgin Baylor.  No one is trying to be Jokic or Tim Duncan.  A lot of people would be better off trying to be those guys instead of trying to be freaks like MJ and LeBron.  But capturing the imagination is part of greatness, and if you don't have sizzle and flair, you need to win a lot, like Duncan, for you to be properly appreciated.  Winning is still the proof that you didn't just pad stats or look good. || All of those criteria either apply to Jokic or just don’t make sense. 

- He does carry his team night in night out

- 2022 might genuinely be the best carry job in sports history. The fact he took that team to the playoffs, let alone the 6th seed when his second option was a slightly washed up Will Barton is genuinely mind boggling. That teams offensive rating when he wasn’t on the floor was 86.3. For context, the Wizards who have far and away the worst offense in the league this season currently have an offensive rating of 104.8. Without Jokic that team might not have won 5 games. 

- According to advanced metrics, Jokic is actually one of the most effective, impactful defenders in league history. While I agree that these absolutely over estimate his defensive impact, largely because his offensive impact leads to less fast break opportunities and thus less easy shots, and because of his dominance as a defensive rebounder. However, I would argue that it doesn’t really matter. If other aspects of his game are leading to opponents scoring less when he is on the court, he is still impacting both sides of the ball at a high level. 

- Why on earth does the all star game matter. That might genuinely be the dumbest criteria for what makes a player elite ever.

- Name a single NBA player with multiple rings who never played with an all star. 

- Off of vibes, I feel Jokic feels pretty unbeatable.

- This means nothing

- Jokic is one of the most well rounded basketball players ever. 

I would like you to elaborate on what you feel makes SGA the better player. || I’m not sure how anyone runs the “not athletic” line anymore. Great stamina, which you admitted. Stronger than basically everyone, which you admitted. Crazy quick hands and reactions…what exactly is missing for you? His lack of high flying dunks and minimal leaping blocks is pretty clearly a choice, not an inability to do it, it’s his playstyle. || Yeah, he’s not consistently good on transition defense either which on fast breaks have proved costly at times as the best rim protector on that team is AG who has been out or playing injured lately. || He’s a great passer, but saying it’s better than LeBron’s is a bridge too far. They’re both elite passers, but Jokic’s higher assist numbers are higher due to the kind of offense they run. Jokic has one DHO assist for every brilliant assist he dishes. || It’s also an opportunity to redefine what makes a player great, and how championships should factor into that. || You can’t assume that he won’t get another ring. The league is wide open currently, no dominant superteams. Nuggets could easily win one this year, even, if Murray figures it out. It’s not super likely, but far from impossible.

And Jokic is only 29. He could be at or near his peak for another 5-6 years. He’s been an iron man, knock on wood, and his game doesn’t rely too much on athleticism. Lot can happen in that time. It’s not like the nuggets have totally mortgaged their future or anything.  || [removed] || The talent isn’t higher just because you don’t know who played back then. 

Also the CBA hasn’t made it harder to win alone it’s been injuries. Every team that won suffered an injury after. Bucks never had their entire roster back after Middleton was hurt. Warriors lost Poole and Porter Jr and others. Nuggets lost Bruce Brown and Jamal Murray played hurt. 

These players don’t get graded on a curve sorry to burst your bubble || He could very well just retire early and go race horses. || [removed] || If he retired after this season, he'd be a 7x All NBA player 5x 1st team), 3x MVP, 1x FMVP. He's a lock for All NBA and 1st team.  Not including any potential championship or MVP awards. 
 
46 players in NBA history have 7x All NBA selections. 25 of those have at least 5x All NBA 1st team selections. Of those 25, 11 have 1 or fewer rings. He goes from a 21/11/7 regular season player to a 28/12/7.5 in the playoffs.  He has a 55% win% in the playoffs through over 90 games.
 
 I don't think it's a  stretch at all to call him a Top 20-Top 25 player ever all. The only thing that could potentially be holding him back is how much  you value raw stat totals and/or raw games.  Not every player is judged based on their longevity, some people have insane peaks propelling them higher in rankings. || He's top 10 in basketball skill/ability already IMO.

But then again, I was always one to find listing accolades to compare players uninteresting. I'm just talking about what he can do on the court. || How many 3 time MVP’s are there? || He is going to be top 10 across the board and top 5 in center, it’s difficult to crack that even if we discount bill Russell and wilt || Idk, I think there are very reasonable arguments for him to be top 15 already. It just depends what you value. If you really place a lot of value on like the number of seasons in which someone played at an all star level then currently Jokic won’t make top 20, sure. But if you instead value the level of play someone showed at their peak, or their big resume accomplishments (chips, MVP’s), he has an argument.

Personally I have a hard time putting guys like Barkley, Malone, Nash who never won a chip ahead of Jokic. Same with guys like KD who only won chips as part of a ridiculous superteam/weren't the clear best player, and guys like Jerry West who never sniffed being the best player in the league. And I also give advanced stats some credit when they agree with the eye test, and Jokic has some of the best advanced stats seasons (& playoff runs) of all time.

The close-to-consensus top 11 (IMO, and in no particular order) is: Jordan LeBron Kareem Wilt Russell Magic Bird Duncan Shaq Kobe Hakeem Steph.

After that it gets tough and it depends what you value. But you could make an argument for Jokic as low as like 13, again, depending on what you value. 

Personally I can’t put him top 10 unless he wins another chip, but pretty much as soon as he does (assuming it’s not as part of a superteam or something) he’s top 10 in my book, regardless of how the rest of his career goes. || >Most elite guys virtually guaranteed a team 50-wins

Hakeem had many 40 something win seasons, KD had a few, Kobe had a few, Wade, Giannis, LeBron, Curry.

I've checked 7 guys so far, all 7 have multiple sub 50 win seasons. Idk where you're getting this from, but it's just not true. || The Nuggets have won 48 or more games in every year of Jokic's true MVP winning prime. And that 48 win season was because Jamal Murray was out the whole year || I know some people are terrified of advanced stats, but isn’t he top of the pile on “contribute to winning” stats? Honestly, I might be biting on troll bait here, but that question seems ridiculous. || [removed] || >His assists become extremely valuable and count towards his DBPM, which has overvalued him insanely on that end. 

Overvalued in DBPT but simultaneously undervalued in OBPM where he's already at the top. || Does LeBron not have any other 3-yr stretches that make your list?

I’m shocked considering some of the mediocre rosters he elevated. || [removed] || I'm not sure what you are arguing. Of course he carries this team. While Lebron/MJ had bad teams, Jokic has a decent starting five (Cavs1.0 LBJ and early MJ had no one on Porter Jrs level, let alone Murray and Aron Gordon). Its jut that BPM has as much to do with the quality of your bench. Denver is notoriously top-heavy.

I didn't make my point correctly. For the people that argue Jokic isn't the best player the last few years, no amount of advanced stats are going to convince them. He clearly is. The arguments against him have nothing to do with performance. Its either ""he's unathletic/lumbering"" or ""he's a white euro trash"". These aren't exactly high level arguments. So there is no point in throwing more proof at them. Its like arguing with flat-earthers.

I was responding to the OP using advanced stats comparing him to the GOATs. I was just pointing out that you can't use these numbers because the eras had such different baselines. What would peak Jordan have looked like with the space players have today? How much more efficient would Lebron's 2013 advanced stats look like if D-Wade wasn't a 25% 3 point shooter?

No one can make a judgement on those comparisons equivocally. IMHO, he is creeping into the second tier all-time. His peak seams to be as good as anyones (or better) but at that level longevity and championships matter. We'll see how he manages on both of those.

Either way, I think everyone on this thread is in agreement that Jokic is fucking awesome. || [removed] || It’s hard to say, do you mean carry them in the regular season or playoffs? Because in the regular season I see the argument, but(at least statistically since eye test is not a source), LeBron is the heaviest lifter in the playoffs since at least  Jordan as we do not have the data readily available from that time. At least based off the knowledge I have in terms of databases out there. || Def the best floor raiser i have ever seen || Lebron carried that dodgshit cavs team to the finals lmfao || I mean this as no disrespect to Jokic, as he clearly is the best player in the league right now, but the answer is that BPM specifically awards his style of play and statistical profile exponentially more than any player maybe in league history.


Much like it did with guards that could rebound (ie Westbrook) before it was recalculated, BPM indexes bigs that distribute the ball and rebound well extremely high on both offense and defense. This leads to things like Jokic being statistically the 3rd best defensive player of all-time by DBPM. || Doesn't it? 

The stat measures what individual players do on the court but also compares it to what their team does and he's arguably the best player in the league on a team that's otherwise not very good outside of him.  MJ, LeBron, and Curry played otherworldly but had other great players around them.  Jokic doesn't.

Now, Jokic is definitely a great player but in a lot of ways BPM is a stat that's practically designed for him to excel in. || Being fair, some of the advanced stats clearly overvalue certain player profiles when compared to others. For example, while Jokic is by no means a bad defender, he is only average, DBPM has him ranked as the 3rd best defender of all time.#

How can we take stats just as face value when that is the case for example? || [removed] || If Giannis wins another one he’s arguably a top 10 player OAT. What do you mean by nobody talking about him like a potential top 10 player ? That’s literally called recency bias. || [removed] || There absolutely is a discussion lmao. There’s even a discussion rn and that’s why Shai is #1 in voting rn || [removed] || He has the worst lateral movement in the game. And, that makes it very easy to just dribble around him. His defense isn't only not good, besides getting in the passing lane for steals, it's not existent.  || Not right now, ill try to look it later (im on phone) and saw the graph like last season on the Mavs subreddit. 

But i mean, Luka last season averaged 33.9 ppg and 9.8 apg, thats almost 54ppg without counting possible 3 pointers / free throws created; don't think its very hard to look if someone had a season with more points created combined (not trying to be an asshole, english is not my first language) but again im on phone and can't look it up :P || I said best player in the league on the best team lol. || Tatum is the best player on the team, he was when Theiss was starting, he is now that Jrue and KP are in. He has probably been since he was 22. While he is nowhere near Jokic, he is not far from anyone else. Remember there is much more to the game than just stats, like defending and winning. OKC is insanely talented and young, they have done shit on post season. Do you think Shai regular season accolades doesn't have shit to do with playing on a good and well managed team?"
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-01-28,nbadiscussion,1ic2mtz,"No, it's not recency bias, Jokic is that good.","This season, Jokic is currently averaging 30.3/13.1/10.2, putting him 3rd in scoring, 3rd in rebounding, and 2nd in assists. Meanwhile he is averaging 65.7% TS, making him the 2nd most efficient volume scorer (players scoring at least 20.0 ppg), behind only Sabonis. Oh yeah and he's the third most efficient 3 point shooter in the league hitting 47.4% of his attempts. That is a mind bogglingly impressive box score. You could very seriously  argue that Jokic is the only player in NBA history to simultaneously be the best scorer, play maker, and rebounder in the world.

Throughout NBA history, there have been exactly 5 individual season where an individual recorded a BMP of 13.0 or higher. 1 was LeBron in 2008-09, the other 4 were all Jokic. This season he is on pace to break his own record, with a BMP of 14.23.  Yes, BMP can be a flawed stat, but the individuals with top 10 BMP seasons not named Jokic are Michael Jordan (3 times), LeBron James (once), and Steph Curry (once). That is a very, very good list to be a part of.

My last point is that off of vibes I've gotten watching basketball over the last few years is that it has felt like Jokic has been the best basketball player in the world for the last 4 years . How many all time greats over the  last several decades could really claim to have been the best player in the league for 4+ years? Not many. MJ, LeBron, Kareem. Maybe, Shaq, Magic or Tim Duncan.  

  
My point is, that Jokic is that guy. Not only is he awesome, he is historically awesome. It is not ridiculous to consider him to be amongst the greatest centers to ever live, and you should not dismiss him simply because his team didn't win a team award as often as others.",875,316,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ic2mtz/no_its_not_recency_bias_jokic_is_that_good/,2025-01-28 09:22:34,"This post is mostly focused on defining the abilities of a single player, which is great. Unfortunately, the comments focusing on ranking that player, got rapidly uncivil and focused on measuring egos instead of sharing insights. 

Post can remain as an exception to our rules but comments are locked. || Peak-for-peak he has a pretty good case for being the best offensive player ever. I would also say he has a top 10 peak of all-time.

We don’t need to jump the gun on career discussions for him though. It’s not just a rings thing, it’s longevity too. Most guys in that top 12 range have 12+ years of elite play. Jokić has only been star-caliber for 7-8 years. He’ll naturally get his due as his career progresses. || I might be early but for me he’s the best centre I’ve ever seen, I didn’t get to see all of Shaq’s prime but i only remember the later years. Jokic didn’t play with Kobe or D Wade either, even his co star can be inconsistent but there’s no doubt he makes almost everyone a better player, look at Russ this season for example. || Definitely not arguing with the title, but pulling up stats are kind of pointless. Efficiency stats when comparing eras just don't make sense. And the reason his BPM is so historic is the team is appalingly bad when he is not on the court. Now that usually happens when you have a superstar because the rest of the team is cramped with the salary cap. When salaries weren't as crazy in the 70s/80s, teams always had built out rosters. So you didn't see teams cratering when the star was off the court like you do in the Lebron/Steph/Jokic era.

  
Again, I think he's historically great. To crack the GOAT tier discussion, he'll need to win a few more championships. May not be fair to him in the era of parity, but those are the breaks. || The only pushback I’d give is that I don’t think Jokic was the consensus best player in the league until 2023.  A lot of people had Giannis over him until the 2023 title run.  Now of course we can just argue that’s due to winning bias (I’m not sure Jokic got appreciably better between 2022 and 2023, his team was just better), I’m just saying idk if it’s fair to say he’s been the consensus best player for the last 4 seasons.  There were lots of questions about his defense and how well it would hold up in the playoffs. 

He has been a top 3 player for the last 3-4 seasons though, and he’s in the midst of one of the greatest peaks we’ve ever seen. || [removed] || Yeah and he's 4th in steals too with a great assist to turnover ratio. It's actually crazy || Jokic has highest 3 point percentage cause he actually has around 15 heaves this season, if not for those he would would be above 50% || The only thing that matters is championships.   That's it!

He's got one which definitely helps his cause.   If he didn't win one,   I would put him in a different category with Malone or Barkley. || Agree.

I've watched NBA on and off for 35 years and both the eye test and the stats are in agreement, he is a generational big man. As long as he stays healthy and reproduces his current form for a decent number of years he is on track to finish his career as one of the ten greatest players of all time.

Trying to rank him against other all time greats is dificult for the same reason Bird is tough to rank- joker is just so fucking perfect offensively that it papers over any other cracks in his game. || His peak could still be going for few more years
He doesn’t rely on being athletic he only falls off when his focus is off || Agreed with most the comments he is the best offensive player ever

And I would say His defence isn’t elite, but it’s definitely underrated || He has a great case obviously 



I diminish jokic from greats simply because...


DEFENSE.


Bill Russell 11 rings DEFENSE 
Shaq DEFENSE 
Hakeem DEFENSE 
Kareem DEFENSE 
Duncan DEFENSE 
Wilt DEFENSE 


Jokic has a great case but there is a reason when we talk top 5 any position or top 5 centers they all have DEFENSE || Just going to add that if you removed end of the quarter heaves, which Jokic leads the league in, then I believe he is the most efficient 3 point shooter in the league. || [removed] || He is on a five year run that is at least ARGUABLY better than anyone else’s. And the years before his numbers were still all nba level. At some we have accept that super efficient scoring, wonder passing and dominant rebounding combined with the most team oriented mindset possible probably will make you a legendary player. I think he’s better at the game than Magic or Bird. We are watching a phenomenal player in his prime. In the same way as I accepted Steph was the GOAT shooter quite early in his career I now accept that Denver had a top 10 player of all time. Things improve and people get better at playing games it’s only to be expected that a 2025 player might  do some things that weren’t being done in 05 or 95. I think we should all enjoy it. || Giannis is right there with him if not better. Defense is a thing in the NBA. || Comparing players across eras is dumb especially if you don't have a clear cut criteria. Plus anything you judge a player on is based around their teammates rather it's stats, awards or winning everything is skewed by how good or bad your teammates are and the fit put around the best player. || Yep. We’re watching a basketball savant. He’s the most bizarre super talent I’ve ever seem. Incredibly limited athletically in a sport that rewards athleticism as much as any sport, but his IQ, size, strength, vision, hand eye coordination, mentality, and work ethic are all off the charts elite.

Guy is truly an anomaly, and so much fun to watch.  || he's in the midst greatest offensive peak ever. never seen a dude elevate average players like this. westbrook was on his way out of the league! aaron gordon, bruce brown, KCP, efficiency jumped huge playing next to joker. 

give this dude an allstar like every other ATG had and its a wrap. bulls dynasty had scottie locked in on a notoriously underpaid contract, meanwhile nugs are paying murray and MPJ max to be average efficiency volume scorers. 

if joker had a competent FO behind him he would already have 4 rings. their best value signing in Westbrook was JOKER's  idea ! dude is a better GM than his own GM || “Because his team didn’t win a team award as often as others”? He has more mvps than conference finals appearances lol. You can’t put him in the same category as MJ, lebron, Kareem, Shaq, magic, and Tim Duncan yet. And best player in the league for the past 4+ years? Maybe but embiid won an mvp during one of those years. And I’d argue that the best player in the league on the best team the past 4+ years has been Tatum. Deep playoff runs every year. || You guys know when you make your best players ever that you don't really have to include players like pre 80s even pre 90s, it's not like you saw Bill Russell so why would I put him in my top ten. Make your own top 10 with what you know, dont be a sheep || [removed] || Ok, let's discuss. 

Yes, Jokic is that good, for all the statistical reasons you listed... And, he did finally lead his team to a very elusive title, and has a good amount of accolades. 
But, what does that mean?

A lot of the NFL world seems ready to crown Patrick mahomes the goat, for potentially winning 3 super bowls in a row. Why? Cuz there, they understand the importance of winning, over statistical achievements. 
Yes, the NFL is different, and due to winner take all playoff formats, it's harder to win 3 in a row. I'll give you all of that. 

Bringing it back to the NBA... What criticism is often levied against Wilt Chamberlain, for his goat case? He didn't win enough. I can provide all sorts of context and history, regarding the Bill Russell superteams, and lack of free agency and post injury Wilt and blah blah... But, at the end of the day, he didn't get it done, despite his ridiculous list of all time records (which are even smaller than they should be, cuz certain stats weren't even counted when he played...)

Winning matters, is the point. It shouldn't be your end all, be all... But, it matters. 

And in that category, we need to pump the brakes a little bit for Jokic.

Then there's the recency bias issue, of trying to put the proper context around Jokic in this era, and trying to compare that to previous era's---which is already a fools errand in many ways. But, the entire play style of the league is very different. The rules are different. Positionless basketball is a very new concept. Centers of the past trained their entire lives to play in those styles and systems. David Robinson is a GREAT center---but recency bias, stats, and analytics will never give him the credit he deserves. They also won't add any context or history, of him consistently playing against other great centers. 

Your comparing a guy, with an insane usage rate, in a positionless league, who has the ball in his hands all the time, and basically makes all the decisions on the floor... To players of the past, that had roles, played in systems, were generally less ball dominant, etc, had to rely on point guards to get them the ball, where high scoring point guards were anomalies... These are the areas where recency bias will tell you Jokic is ""SO MUCH BETTER"" than everyone before... When it's more complicated than that. 

Also, it's an inflated era. The commissioner has admitted, on camera, rules were changed intentionally to make scoring easier. Pace and more 3s makes it easier for rebound opportunities, and not just for centers anymore. There's no physicality in the league. Assists are given out like candy now. Freedom of movement and carrying/lack of travels makes it easier for everyone... The spacing has never been so wide open... The center position has NEVER been so physically weak, out of necessity, to keep up with modern offenses.

So ya... Admire what he's doing. But no, he's not goat center yet, he's not top 15 already...

Damn... Let his have his career. Recency bias and analytics are frothing at the mouth to put all these players right now in goat conversations and put them as all time greats, before they've even put in the real work. || Not Magic for 4 years. Bird though for sure 

3 MVP
5 runner ups in 8 years || My only contention with his placements among the offensive goats is his slight playoff dip. I'd expect a guy with his regular season profile to either have LeBron or Jordan relative box score numbers, or goat level impact data, but he doesn't have either of those, in the playoffs. || Stats aren't everything. He has great stats-- legendary stats, the best stats--yes. And he can make a team better when he's the focal point.

But beyond that, he lacks a lot of the traits that ""the best player in the world"" should have:

* the ability to take over games and series, night in, night out
* the ability to carry a team much farther than they would go otherwise
* excellent defense
* dominating his fellow stars in at least one All-Star game
* helping his team win multiple rings (still to be decided)
* the dominant ""Shaq effect"" that makes he and his team feel unbeatable 
* the killer approach of MJ
* the all-around dominance of prime Bron

He looks like ""one of the best,"" but not ""the best."" Right now, SGA is who really impresses me. || If Embiid never got hurt last year then he would have ran away with the MVP again. Why isn’t that talked about? || I think he's currently the best player in the league, and has been for the last 3-4 seasons.

  
His passing (better than LeBron's), footwork (great fundamentals), and shooting (both midrange and 3p) are elite. The only thing holding him back is that he isnt athletic, but he is strong and has immense stamina. || Jokic is just like Wilt Chamberlain. Does everything except win championships || Idk, try maybe not blowing a lead to the sub .500 Bulls right after getting blown out by the .500 Twolves. || Assuming he has the longevity, he's going to get boned on the championship thing. IMO the level of talent in the NBA is so much higher than any other era. The age defying feats of LBJ/Steph/Durant may be coming to an end, but the parity (also due to CBA changes) is astounding.

I don't know if he will be able to get another ring and thats just not fair. But those are the breaks. || ^^^ On the alltime lists is where Jokic sometimes gets overhyped. He's not a top 15 player yet, every other player in the top 20 has several more years of star play on their resume. Assuming health he's on pace to retire top 10, but we shouldn't be crowning him based on a hypothetical. || Yep. If his first 10 match the second 10, he's not just top 10 but top 3. But we'll see if he maintains his pace. Still lots of basketball to be played. || Most elite guys virtually guaranteed a team 50-wins, for the majority of their prime. We have to consider the fact that maybe, his lack of rim protection makes him contribute less to winning than other all-time greats. || We can’t deny that Jamal Murray played at a superstar level in that championship run though. He was completely unstoppable alongside Jokic. Jokic is definitely the best Center of the last 15 or so years. But when you look at the sheer two way dominance of guys like Hakeem especially, and Shaq, it’s impossible to put Jokic above them all time rn. || BPM weighs certain statistics differently by position, and Jokic's statistical profile has his stats weighted for a SF/PF hybrid, if I recall correctly. His assists become extremely valuable and count towards his DBPM, which has overvalued him insanely on that end. 

I think BPM is going to need another recalibration, the way they had to do it for Westbrook's rebounding numbers. It's just not putting out the correct value for Jokic's contributions on the defensive end.

Jokic is clearly a top 20 all-time player already, and his peak is astronomical offensively, but I agree that we're going to have a statistical reckoning in the near future that will give us a little better perspective. || >Efficiency stats when comparing eras just don't make sense.

Using raw numbers can be a little dangerous since efficiency has gone up over the years, but it's not hard to adjust for era. Very few players have been as efficient as Jokic on as high of volume for as long as him.

>And the reason his BPM is so historic is the team is appalingly bad when he is not on the court.

I don't think BPM is a great way to judge a player's impact, but it's a box-score based stat; it doesn't look at how a player or his team performs on vs off the court.

>Now that usually happens when you have a superstar because the rest of the team is cramped with the salary cap. So you didn't see teams cratering when the star was off the court like you do in the Lebron/Steph/Jokic era.

Even if on/off data is inflated in recent years compared to the 70s/80s, Jokic is still off the charts.

Here are the highest 3-year on/off stretches for some contemporaries:

Player | On/Off | Years
---------|----------|--------
Jokic | +21 | 23-25
Curry | +18.6| 14-16
LeBron| +16.5| 15-17
Embiid| +11.2| 21-23
Giannis|+10.1| 18-20
Harden|+7.8| 14-16
Luka | +7.5 | 23-25

>To crack the GOAT tier discussion, he'll need to win a few more championships. May not be fair to him in the era of parity, but those are the breaks.

Why? Championships are a team effort. If we're talking about the best *player*, why judge them based off of a binary stat that requires a good team? || I meaaannnn, Lebron had dogshit Cavs, Jordan had pretty awful early Bulls, Luka Mavs, Kobe Lakers, etc, they all had to carry, he just clearly, 100%, carries better than all of em, no? || if all the stars in the past had way better teammates then wouldn't that also mean it was easier for them to win championships? || You're right that sky-high BPMs happen when you have a superstar because the rest of the team is cramped with the salary cap, but that doesn't explain why Jokic's BPM still surpasses all those other historical superstars (peak MJ, peak Bron, '16 Steph, etc).

(I also agree that multiple championships and Finals MVPs are table stakes for getting into the GOAT discussion, fair or not) || [removed] || But Giannis was in discussions for becoming possibly a top 10 all time player if he kept up his success. Then Jokic came into his own and was even *better* than Giannis, and now no one talks about Giannis as a potentional top 10 player anymore. || [removed] || He's been the best player for the last 4 years. It's his 5th. Stops this ""discussion"" nonsense, that's just the media, because no one would watch, if they just went ""yup...Jok is no1, there ain't really clear no2, sry"". It's Lebron like peak || Also something to take into consideration which I am surprised never seems to get brought up is his lack of defense. The all around GOATS were some of the best on both sides of the ball. Jokic definitely one of the top playmakers all time right now tho and averaging a triple double is just insane. || Eh I mean he’s averaging a 30 pt triple double and dominating the advanced stats. Individual bad games aren’t bringing the averages down enough to matter.

I agree with you on everything but this is the most important part. Joker is literally ""basketball essence"", he plays the game the way it should be played. || I don’t understand your MVP argument. So what Embiid won an MVP? LeBron didn’t win an MVP every year either, but he was clearly the best player in the league || Tatum is clearly not the best player in the league. He plays on a stacked team so the team is really good but there is no reason to bring him up in a conversation for the best player in the league. || Embiid won an MVP that he should never have won. I agree with the rest thou. || Is Bill Russel your goat? Has any player ever won multiple rings without ever playing with all star teammate? No, because basketball is a team sport. No player has ever had such a large discrepancy in his team’s success in the minutes he plays compared to the minutes he sits, so don’t try and pretend he doesn’t impact winning. || Our sub is for in-depth discussion. Low-effort comments or stating opinions as facts are not permitted. Please support your opinions with well-reasoned arguments, including stats and facts as applicable. || Let me ask you this, can you name me one NBA player in history with multiple NBA titles who never played with a single all star? No you can’t. Sure, a few of the Nuggets teams constructed over the years have actually had very solid supporting casts, but solid supporting casts rarely win championships. You could seriously argue the 2022 Nuggets were the worst supporting cast to ever reach the playoffs. In addition to never have an awesome second option many of the Nuggets teams have also lacked depth. The only real exceptions were 2020 and 2023, where shocker they went to the conference finals before losing the eventual champions and won it all respectively. || That’s just straight up, verifiably untrue. Last season he averaged 28.7/13.4/8.7 on 62.5% TS in the post season. The season prior he averaged 30/13.5/9.5 on 63.1% TS in the playoffs. The season before that he’s averaged 31/13.5/5.8 on 64.3% TS. Even his first season in the playoffs all the way back in 2019 he averaged 24.5/13.0/8.4 on 
59.6% TS. He has also lead the league in post season PER 4 out of his 6 playoff appearances, and post season BMP 3 times as well. The Nuggets have legitimately never lost a playoff series become of Jokic. || I think his level of excellence put him above SGA but i agree that there is a kinda  ""numeracy bias"" to saying he's the best player in the world or even among the best of all time.  It is obvious to me that he's the most versatile offensive player of all time, in that he is a first option scorer who can face up and post up, shoot the midrange, stretch the floor and hit free throws, while at the same time carve up defenses with making the right reads.  In that way, he's the Michael Jordan of centers.  The difficulty of Joker's excellence is two-fold.  Great players rise in the big moments.  But the best of all meet what the moment requires.  So LeBron most memorable play was a block and MJs most memorable play was a two for one where he stole the ball from an MVP.  Players like Jokic and Steph have to have a really improbable level of excellence on the offensive end to offset what liabilities they sometimes present on the defensive end.  That's just life.

But the second thing is: being the greatest really is more than winning championships or having massive stats.  It comes down to those intangibles, the act of building the legend.  That's the hardest part and not only is it particularly hard for players like Duncan and Jokic, those are two guys that couldn't care less about their legend.  Kids right now are jacking up threes believing they are Steph.  Shimmying into a free throw like KD.  People are yelling Kobe's name throwing something in the trash.  And people are doing fadeaways that they shouldn't even have tried because of MJ and MJ copied Jerry West and Elgin Baylor.  No one is trying to be Jokic or Tim Duncan.  A lot of people would be better off trying to be those guys instead of trying to be freaks like MJ and LeBron.  But capturing the imagination is part of greatness, and if you don't have sizzle and flair, you need to win a lot, like Duncan, for you to be properly appreciated.  Winning is still the proof that you didn't just pad stats or look good. || All of those criteria either apply to Jokic or just don’t make sense. 

- He does carry his team night in night out

- 2022 might genuinely be the best carry job in sports history. The fact he took that team to the playoffs, let alone the 6th seed when his second option was a slightly washed up Will Barton is genuinely mind boggling. That teams offensive rating when he wasn’t on the floor was 86.3. For context, the Wizards who have far and away the worst offense in the league this season currently have an offensive rating of 104.8. Without Jokic that team might not have won 5 games. 

- According to advanced metrics, Jokic is actually one of the most effective, impactful defenders in league history. While I agree that these absolutely over estimate his defensive impact, largely because his offensive impact leads to less fast break opportunities and thus less easy shots, and because of his dominance as a defensive rebounder. However, I would argue that it doesn’t really matter. If other aspects of his game are leading to opponents scoring less when he is on the court, he is still impacting both sides of the ball at a high level. 

- Why on earth does the all star game matter. That might genuinely be the dumbest criteria for what makes a player elite ever.

- Name a single NBA player with multiple rings who never played with an all star. 

- Off of vibes, I feel Jokic feels pretty unbeatable.

- This means nothing

- Jokic is one of the most well rounded basketball players ever. 

I would like you to elaborate on what you feel makes SGA the better player. || I’m not sure how anyone runs the “not athletic” line anymore. Great stamina, which you admitted. Stronger than basically everyone, which you admitted. Crazy quick hands and reactions…what exactly is missing for you? His lack of high flying dunks and minimal leaping blocks is pretty clearly a choice, not an inability to do it, it’s his playstyle. || Yeah, he’s not consistently good on transition defense either which on fast breaks have proved costly at times as the best rim protector on that team is AG who has been out or playing injured lately. || He’s a great passer, but saying it’s better than LeBron’s is a bridge too far. They’re both elite passers, but Jokic’s higher assist numbers are higher due to the kind of offense they run. Jokic has one DHO assist for every brilliant assist he dishes. || It’s also an opportunity to redefine what makes a player great, and how championships should factor into that. || You can’t assume that he won’t get another ring. The league is wide open currently, no dominant superteams. Nuggets could easily win one this year, even, if Murray figures it out. It’s not super likely, but far from impossible.

And Jokic is only 29. He could be at or near his peak for another 5-6 years. He’s been an iron man, knock on wood, and his game doesn’t rely too much on athleticism. Lot can happen in that time. It’s not like the nuggets have totally mortgaged their future or anything.  || [removed] || The talent isn’t higher just because you don’t know who played back then. 

Also the CBA hasn’t made it harder to win alone it’s been injuries. Every team that won suffered an injury after. Bucks never had their entire roster back after Middleton was hurt. Warriors lost Poole and Porter Jr and others. Nuggets lost Bruce Brown and Jamal Murray played hurt. 

These players don’t get graded on a curve sorry to burst your bubble || He could very well just retire early and go race horses. || [removed] || If he retired after this season, he'd be a 7x All NBA player 5x 1st team), 3x MVP, 1x FMVP. He's a lock for All NBA and 1st team.  Not including any potential championship or MVP awards. 
 
46 players in NBA history have 7x All NBA selections. 25 of those have at least 5x All NBA 1st team selections. Of those 25, 11 have 1 or fewer rings. He goes from a 21/11/7 regular season player to a 28/12/7.5 in the playoffs.  He has a 55% win% in the playoffs through over 90 games.
 
 I don't think it's a  stretch at all to call him a Top 20-Top 25 player ever all. The only thing that could potentially be holding him back is how much  you value raw stat totals and/or raw games.  Not every player is judged based on their longevity, some people have insane peaks propelling them higher in rankings. || He's top 10 in basketball skill/ability already IMO.

But then again, I was always one to find listing accolades to compare players uninteresting. I'm just talking about what he can do on the court. || How many 3 time MVP’s are there? || He is going to be top 10 across the board and top 5 in center, it’s difficult to crack that even if we discount bill Russell and wilt || Idk, I think there are very reasonable arguments for him to be top 15 already. It just depends what you value. If you really place a lot of value on like the number of seasons in which someone played at an all star level then currently Jokic won’t make top 20, sure. But if you instead value the level of play someone showed at their peak, or their big resume accomplishments (chips, MVP’s), he has an argument.

Personally I have a hard time putting guys like Barkley, Malone, Nash who never won a chip ahead of Jokic. Same with guys like KD who only won chips as part of a ridiculous superteam/weren't the clear best player, and guys like Jerry West who never sniffed being the best player in the league. And I also give advanced stats some credit when they agree with the eye test, and Jokic has some of the best advanced stats seasons (& playoff runs) of all time.

The close-to-consensus top 11 (IMO, and in no particular order) is: Jordan LeBron Kareem Wilt Russell Magic Bird Duncan Shaq Kobe Hakeem Steph.

After that it gets tough and it depends what you value. But you could make an argument for Jokic as low as like 13, again, depending on what you value. 

Personally I can’t put him top 10 unless he wins another chip, but pretty much as soon as he does (assuming it’s not as part of a superteam or something) he’s top 10 in my book, regardless of how the rest of his career goes. || >Most elite guys virtually guaranteed a team 50-wins

Hakeem had many 40 something win seasons, KD had a few, Kobe had a few, Wade, Giannis, LeBron, Curry.

I've checked 7 guys so far, all 7 have multiple sub 50 win seasons. Idk where you're getting this from, but it's just not true. || The Nuggets have won 48 or more games in every year of Jokic's true MVP winning prime. And that 48 win season was because Jamal Murray was out the whole year || I know some people are terrified of advanced stats, but isn’t he top of the pile on “contribute to winning” stats? Honestly, I might be biting on troll bait here, but that question seems ridiculous. || [removed] || >His assists become extremely valuable and count towards his DBPM, which has overvalued him insanely on that end. 

Overvalued in DBPT but simultaneously undervalued in OBPM where he's already at the top. || Does LeBron not have any other 3-yr stretches that make your list?

I’m shocked considering some of the mediocre rosters he elevated. || [removed] || I'm not sure what you are arguing. Of course he carries this team. While Lebron/MJ had bad teams, Jokic has a decent starting five (Cavs1.0 LBJ and early MJ had no one on Porter Jrs level, let alone Murray and Aron Gordon). Its jut that BPM has as much to do with the quality of your bench. Denver is notoriously top-heavy.

I didn't make my point correctly. For the people that argue Jokic isn't the best player the last few years, no amount of advanced stats are going to convince them. He clearly is. The arguments against him have nothing to do with performance. Its either ""he's unathletic/lumbering"" or ""he's a white euro trash"". These aren't exactly high level arguments. So there is no point in throwing more proof at them. Its like arguing with flat-earthers.

I was responding to the OP using advanced stats comparing him to the GOATs. I was just pointing out that you can't use these numbers because the eras had such different baselines. What would peak Jordan have looked like with the space players have today? How much more efficient would Lebron's 2013 advanced stats look like if D-Wade wasn't a 25% 3 point shooter?

No one can make a judgement on those comparisons equivocally. IMHO, he is creeping into the second tier all-time. His peak seams to be as good as anyones (or better) but at that level longevity and championships matter. We'll see how he manages on both of those.

Either way, I think everyone on this thread is in agreement that Jokic is fucking awesome. || [removed] || It’s hard to say, do you mean carry them in the regular season or playoffs? Because in the regular season I see the argument, but(at least statistically since eye test is not a source), LeBron is the heaviest lifter in the playoffs since at least  Jordan as we do not have the data readily available from that time. At least based off the knowledge I have in terms of databases out there. || Def the best floor raiser i have ever seen || Lebron carried that dodgshit cavs team to the finals lmfao || I mean this as no disrespect to Jokic, as he clearly is the best player in the league right now, but the answer is that BPM specifically awards his style of play and statistical profile exponentially more than any player maybe in league history.


Much like it did with guards that could rebound (ie Westbrook) before it was recalculated, BPM indexes bigs that distribute the ball and rebound well extremely high on both offense and defense. This leads to things like Jokic being statistically the 3rd best defensive player of all-time by DBPM. || Doesn't it? 

The stat measures what individual players do on the court but also compares it to what their team does and he's arguably the best player in the league on a team that's otherwise not very good outside of him.  MJ, LeBron, and Curry played otherworldly but had other great players around them.  Jokic doesn't.

Now, Jokic is definitely a great player but in a lot of ways BPM is a stat that's practically designed for him to excel in. || Being fair, some of the advanced stats clearly overvalue certain player profiles when compared to others. For example, while Jokic is by no means a bad defender, he is only average, DBPM has him ranked as the 3rd best defender of all time.#

How can we take stats just as face value when that is the case for example? || [removed] || If Giannis wins another one he’s arguably a top 10 player OAT. What do you mean by nobody talking about him like a potential top 10 player ? That’s literally called recency bias. || [removed] || There absolutely is a discussion lmao. There’s even a discussion rn and that’s why Shai is #1 in voting rn || [removed] || He has the worst lateral movement in the game. And, that makes it very easy to just dribble around him. His defense isn't only not good, besides getting in the passing lane for steals, it's not existent.  || Not right now, ill try to look it later (im on phone) and saw the graph like last season on the Mavs subreddit. 

But i mean, Luka last season averaged 33.9 ppg and 9.8 apg, thats almost 54ppg without counting possible 3 pointers / free throws created; don't think its very hard to look if someone had a season with more points created combined (not trying to be an asshole, english is not my first language) but again im on phone and can't look it up :P || I said best player in the league on the best team lol. || Tatum is the best player on the team, he was when Theiss was starting, he is now that Jrue and KP are in. He has probably been since he was 22. While he is nowhere near Jokic, he is not far from anyone else. Remember there is much more to the game than just stats, like defending and winning. OKC is insanely talented and young, they have done shit on post season. Do you think Shai regular season accolades doesn't have shit to do with playing on a good and well managed team?"

Rui and Reaves are their best assets and if you throw Knecht and picks, that might be enough for a near max player.

In that regards,
Probably 
Luka
Vincent 
DFS
Lebron 
Centre (turner or kessler) || I wonder if the Lakers will try to move Reaves for big man. A Luke/Reeves backcourt is pretty brutal on defense. Wonder if they'd call the Raptors about Poeltl? Or maybe Reaves to the Magic for Wendal Carter Jr? There's not exactly a ton of starting quality centers out there for trade.  || The new Mavs look like the Clippers IMO. A solid on-ball one-way star guard, an elite two-way player, and solid roleplayers around them. That's a good team, high regular season floor, but almost 0 chance to win a ring. To add to the comprisons, all 3 stars are over their peak and will only get worse in time.

The Lakers at the moment are a mess. I don't see a path for them to be an average defensive team, and Luka, Bron and Reaves seem a bit redundant on offense. Sure, Luka alone proved to carry a team to a top 5 offense, so this group can be top 3 (or even the ebst half-cout offense), but that is not enough to be a contender. Interestingly, there was a world where the old Lakers could compete for a title if the stars aligned, and I think the chance is lost (for this year), unless they make a follow-up move or two. || If I would set it up, I might move dinwiddie to one, Irving to two, Thompson three. 
Kyrie is awesome but I somehow can’t see him as a facilitator, he’s very good with an aggressive playmaker. He was great with LeBron, Harden and Luka. 

The issue with this lineup is it lacks Luka. Without him you have some isoball with Klay pouting in the corner waiting for a pass that never comes. 

AD doesn’t create, he isos or finishes. 
Kyrie is a willing passer, but when he’s in scoring mode he will just attack. So they kinda switch isos I guess? I dunno, they got rid of a generational playmaker while having a team that relies on a playmaker and a system of plays and movement built around that. 

It’s not a bad team but I just don’t see the fit. Not even talking about chemistry issues after they signed players who wanted to play with Doncic. || I would move PJ to the bench and start Grimes. I can’t see PJ guarding wings but Grimes can and he can shoot. || In short term both teams are worse even if fully healthy. Lakers now the worst defensive team in the league probably. || Lakers should start luka, reeves, bron, dfs and hayes. Hachimura off the bunch for scoring punch.  Dfs is needed to shore up defense.  Hopefully Lakers get a guy like Poetl or Claxton to start the 5 and then they are cooking with gas. || As a Pelicans fan I am actually very curious to see if Luka can actually make Jaxson Hayes  good on offense. He cant help Hayes on defense or rebounding but Hayes can rim run and set screens. || The cap space and trade requirements are beyond my comprehension. Can Los Angeles move LeBron to Miami for Butler? Butler and Luka can compliment each other (or destroy each other I'm not sure).  What are your thoughts? Is there another move incoming || Kyrie can’t. He’s had 14 years and multiple teams and chances to prove it. He’s 32 and starting to slow down.

Moving the super star from the back court to the front court is only going to make things harder for Irving too, since teams can now put their best guard defender on Kyrie instead of Luka.

Take Boston for example. Brown and Jrue were the primary defenders on Luka, and when Jrue was on him that meant Brown was out, so Kyrie was facing off against guys like Derrick White.

Now Kyrie is going to get the Jrue and Brown treatment. Jrue will likely be the primary because they’d rather Jrue be on Kyrie than Klay, but if Klay is ever out of the game when Kyrie is in or Kyrie starts going off, Boston will plant Brown on his ass.

It’s the same with any team though. Kyrie is going to have more difficulty scoring, so AD will have to play even better than Luka did last year to carry the team. I just don’t see that happening. || AD already has || I mean realistically he just takes a paycut so Lakers can get another max player for best shot at winning. || Lebron is 40 bro, teams target Austin and Luka plays no defense. Who's back there cleaning up the paint lol Jaxon Hayes hahhaha. || Yeah. I think before deadline closes they’ll end up with a big man, maybe through LeBron taking less. And, I think LeBron’s minutes will go down as Luka can take the full offense on his own. || LeBron is 40. He doesn’t play defense because he can’t not because he’s choosing not to lmao || [removed] || > 2-3 year period the Mavs win if healthy. 

This is one of my problems, define win in this context. Are the Mavs really a BETTER team now?

They made a move to win now, but I don’t see how this team can possibly be considered to be better than the one with Luka on it.

Let’s use the Celtics again as an example.

Last year the Celtics won handily because they could focus Luka and the rest of the team couldn’t elevate to counter.

AD is not better than Luka. If they met in the Finals again this year, Celtics focus on AD with our 500 centers and now also have Brown free to cover another dude. 

So Jrue locks up Kyrie again, Brown locks up Klay, Tatum is able to support any one of them, and Horford/Unicorn/Kornett with Queta and Tillman as bodies wrangle AD.

No way AD goes off for MORE than Luka does, and the rest of the team becomes easier to defend.

I mean, Mavs have max 2 chances to win with AD. This year as a 7-8 seed, and next year. Does anyone see that happening? || Shams claimed that the Mavs made the movie because they were worried about Luka’s conditioning. || Huh? If AD stays healthy, if they keep Kyrie etc. etc. and that’s assuming they’re a better team now, which may very well not be true. || Mavs just became easier to defend.

Sure the Mavs are big, but Klay Thompson is not the shooter and defender he once was and Kyrie has shown over and over again he can’t be the number 1 on a championship team.

AD is also easier (relatively speaking) to stop than Luka.

So they have the exact same problem they had last year, but now with a slightly worse player. || And what about the offensive production you get from Luka? Kyrie and AD aren’t making up for that. The Thunder lock Kyrie up and then who’s beating you on that team? Absolutely no one.

With all his flaws we’ve seen time and time again you need guys like Luka that can just take over games in the playoffs. Last time Kyrie was the #1 he got ran out of Boston and AD didn’t see any major playoff success until LeBron. || Kyrie can score so can PJ & Gafford & Ant what are you talking about lol || Lakers can’t offer enough to get Turner, assuming you’re talking about Myles. Reaves and Rui are an awful fit in Indy and the Pacers are already thin in the front court and trying to win now. || yeah reaves is def outta here now since all possessions gonna be eaten by luka and bron. || they're not gonna trade Reaves. He has one of the most team friendly contracts out there. They wouldn't be getting anything close to his production if they traded him away || Ruis been starting tho || I get what you are saying, but Derrick white is an elite. Defender. He came in 7th in DPoY voting last year. || You keep mentioning the Celtics acting like a Player like Kyrie can be “locked down” it’s hilarious, can jrue and white bother him and play great defense yes but cool out buddy, and 32 is your prime no one’s slowing down 😂😂. Not one of those 100 big men you think you have is in the same universe as AD and he averages 30-12 in a series with the Cs. They will live and die by the three against the Mavs with Lively, AD, and Gafford  in the paint im from Boston saying this 😔 || The only way they do that if LeBron takes the vet minimum. Which is not gonna happen. || This defense is swiss cheese lmfao. The lakers punted on the season idk why nobody realizes that yet || What? Have you actually watched him this season? His on ball defense is still good but his help defense is bad because he decides not to help too much to conserve energy. Now that Luka is 100 percent gonna be the offensive focus, he can now conserve more energy on offense and be a spot up guy which he actually prefers. || Teams will be able to score on Dallas, Klay is not the prime Klay anymore, Kyrie will get targeted and PJ will have to defend the other teams best guy. It’s not going to be great and def can be exposed if they aren’t producing offensively which will be harder to do now || Removed. Maintain civility in this subreddit. Telling someone they don't know ball is never going to fly here, people clearly have different opinions, it doesn't mean they're inferior to yours. || Comparing AD to Luka without mentioning defense is a bit disingenuous lol || >I mean, Mavs have max 2 chances to win with AD. This year as a 7-8 seed, and next year. Does anyone see that happening?

I for one certainly do not. You’re banking on two players who although extremely gifted, some of their biggest criticisms have been not being able to be a #1 option. And that’s not even getting into the health concerns the two of them have. 

And I don’t see how this doesn’t impact the locker room.. your franchise corner stone, at worst top 5 player in the league and someone who could be a perennial MVP candidate for the next 5+ years, who was pivotal in taking you to the finals for the first time in over a decade and you just trade him like that? In a move that arguably makes you worse. || I really don't see this Mavs team beating OKC last year and especially not last year's Minnesota. || What do you mean Kyrie has shown again and again? He’s had a total of one single playoff run as a number 1 in his entire career? So he’s actually shown just once that he wasn’t able to win the ring as a number 1 || All them bigs are gonna just clog the paint. They have no good play making anymore || Would be a three team deal sending a cheaper (long term) center to the Pacers that they don't have to pay big money next year. || While that is true, he’s heavily redundant to Luka Doncic. He’s an actual asset and I could see us flipping him for a better fit. || They have to. He doesn’t fix next to them, and if you cook another deal using Reaves & Rui, you’re still competing this year. || You being from Boston means absolutely nothing. It honestly makes this take even worse considering.

Kyrie can’t be locked down? Do you have short term memory? You don’t remember his series versus the Bucks when he was the #1 in Boston? || Luckily we won't know how Dallas fares in a series against Boston because they won't even make the WCF. || Why not? If I’m born I’d take a vet min for a shot at another ring. His wealth is mostly from endorsements and outside the NBA investments, so that additional money isn’t insanely huge || Lakers are at 189/190 million for next season. Bron even going down to 25m a year opens up another 25m player in theory right? || Internet act as if LBJ gonna play for another 5 years and is 32 years old || Idc how good his defense is, they are not even in the same stratosphere of player. So no, it’s really not that disingenuous. We are a worse team. Our starting pg is now dinwiddie, unless we move Kyrie to the 1 which worked so well on the Nets! || They wouldn’t have beaten last years Denver either || They don’t win either. The playmaking is in the bun, the clutch shooting is in the bin, the team is just worse. || Are you implying that he could’ve scored more on his other teams but didn’t because he was deferring to be a #2 option lol || There were the pre-LeBron years in Cleveland.... But he couldn't get that team to the playoffs so I guess no chance to prove anything? || Absolutely, and not from the offensive end.  A perimeter defense where Doncic/Reeves/LeBron can be switched is going to get torched by any guy with a first step.  It’s already a problem for the Lakers, but note they don’t have an All NBA rim protector to fall back on.

Lakers def need to move for a center.  Wonder if they could pull together a deal for Claxton?  He’s having a down year, but is both a great rim protector and a good lob threat, something Luka can make the most of. || Averaging 20-5-5 and losing against a guy averaging 30-10-5-2-2 shooting 60% isn’t getting locked down my man || He’s trying to become an owner I think so I’m guessing he’ll need every cent possible to do that. || It’s easy to say for us and makes sense, but nobody does this in practice no matter how rich they are. Everyone always wants more. He can get close to max deals just by being Lebron James for as long as he plays. || $47M is approximately the difference between his salary and the vet minimum. There’s no way he takes that pay cut. That’s a little less than 10% of his career earnings from NBA salaries. || [removed] || You mean when he was 20 years old? When he played with a bottom 3 group of players in the league? Let’s not be entirely disingenuous. That absolutely does not prove anything about kyrie’s abilities. Using a players first couple seasons before they even reach their actual prime levels just seems so bizarre || If you had anything the Raps needed we could get you Bruce Brown and Jacob Poetl.  But I don't think you have anything we need :( || Yeah I was thinking Claxton or Vucevic are the best centers really available, that they can get. Turner isn’t available for what the Lakers can give up, afaik they can’t get Ayton because of the Rookie Max Extension rules, so those are the best they can get. || He shot 35% from the field, 21% from 3 and averaged almost 4 turnovers a game….

If that’s not locked up to you then you must not be very smart. || “Averaging 20” is doing a lot of work there. Turns out averages aren’t super accurate with small sample sizes.

In the series against Boston he scored 12, 16, 35, 21, 15.

Furthermore, let’s look at shooting %.

Game 1: 31%, 0% from 3

Game 2: 38%, 0%

Game 3: 46%, 66%

Game 4: 55%, 16%

Game 5: 31%, 33% || Removed. Maintain civility in this subreddit. || It has everything to do with it.

You’re acting like he’s not had opportunities to be the number 1 option, but if he was good enough, even on team with other super stars he could’ve been the #1.

The fact that you admit he’s never been the number 1 shows you don’t think he’s good enough lol || 20 years old who could possibly prove they were a number one option in their first three years in the league.... Oh wait ya the guy they just traded away had already done that. I'm sure Kyrie will be able to replace that level of offensive production and show everyone at age 32 about to be 33 he's finally ready now to be the focal point of every team's best back court defensive player night in night out and create for others on a team constructed of players who all benefit from having looks generated for them. || Vuc is a good shout.  The Bulls FO is weird though, who knows if he would be cheaper. || Tatum shot 35 and 12 from 3 averaging 12 Hayward the same averaged 7 both playing 30 minutes while Giannis did everything and more. I don’t think you understand basketball that much || By your standards Tatum got “locked down” too right ? || He played behind fuckin Lebron James, Kevin Durant and Luka😂 3 of the top 15 talents to ever play the game. Kyrie is a 6’1 PG || Now you’re arguing against your own thoughts and not me😂 I never said nor believe anything you just said. I just take issue with people saying “Kyrie proven he can’t be a one.” A lot of guys CAN be a one, doesn’t mean they’ll win a championship every year. Harden is a 1 even tho he never got a ring. Norman fuckin Powell is a 1 right now.

Only 2 guys in nba history have been a 1 on a championship team under 6’4. It’s an unreasonable standard of judging players || Vuc is a slow footed non-rim protector. || Okay so they got locked up too? Doesn’t change anything lmfao || He absolutely had a poor series. I personally think it was more pressure than anything, but there’s no question even compared to earlier series that he had a poor series. || Exactly. He’s never been good enough to even be considered a number one when playing next to super stars, because he isn’t one. He’s a star, but never has been and never will be a super star, which should answer the question that if you have Kyrie as your BEST player, you will not be winning a championship.

Btw, LeBron is the only one of those 3 to have a championship as a first option. Durant got his as a #2 to Curry and Luka doesn’t have one.

Hell, when Kyrie was on the Nets “super team” with Durant and James Harden, he was the clear 3rd option to those 2; both of whom have never won a chip as a first option.

Kyrie hasn’t been trapped behind someone like LeBron his whole life. He’s had plenty of chances on plenty of teams to be “the guy,” but he’s not good enough to be the guy, which is why outside of the Celtics he’s always been a second or third option and only had a chip with LeBron.

Btw, he won’t the guy on Mavs with Luka gone either. AD is the first option and Kyrie is the 2nd behind him.

Because Kyrie isn’t a super star. || So is LeBron, but at least Vic wants to play Center || Ya your right in a team game when your 2 other stars get outscored by Kris Middleton together, while Giannis averaged 30-10-5-2-2 means nothing for a PG. your right bruh || Well Kd led that team in scoring and was the best player in the playoffs for those warriors teams. Calling him a 2 is very disingenuous.

This just shows that being a 1 on a championship team is a crapshoot. You need luck and the right team around you. Plenty of guys have the capability, that doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen for everyone.

Giannis is a shoe size away from being ringless as well. This shouldn’t be an indictment of them as players. It’s hard to win a ring. Only one team does it every year. Sometimes you go up against an especially great team and you lose. That doesn’t mean “you’re not a 1.” || Calling Ad a first option is hilarious. The man cannot create offense for himself or others. He can’t be a pick and roll ball handler. You can’t inbound the ball to AD and say “do something.” He can’t.

Ad will rely on others to break down the defense and create him looks. That’s not a 1st option.

I guess we just have a fundamental disagreement about basketball. I don’t view a guy that needs others to create space, create them looks as a number 1 option. That’s one reason the trade was so bad. Luka is like a QB, AD is like a defensive tackle. Both great but one guy has so much more potential to impact a game || I’m not suggesting LeBron play centre either lol just that Vuc is a terrible target and not in anyway a good shout. Lob threat / rim protector is what the Lakers need. || Bro you the one came on here moving the goalposts the discussion was about KYRIE and whether or not he got locked up. What everyone else did was irrelevant because he played like shit too and was a cancer to that team the entire season. Move along. || And those are in short supply and high demand.  To the extent that Portland is asking for an unprotected first and a prospect for their 3rd string center that has an awful injury history. || He averaged 20 while his team shot under 30% from 3 being doubled every time if you actually watch the games you’d understand my boy. The fact you you really think Ky can be “locked down” showed me you know literally nothing about basketball 🤡 || Doesn’t make Vuc any better though does it haha. I’m counting on Claxton personally but every option has their limitations for sure. || You’re clearly a Kyrie fan.. he literally just got locked up by Boston in the finals not even a year ago my guy. You’re not very bright I see. || You’ve clearly never seen a basketball court outside the YMCA so it’s understandable you don’t get it it’s cool 👍 || He got locked down btw"
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-02-04,nbadiscussion,1ii9yy7,I know it hurts to see Luka traded but it's still possible that Luka won't sign an extension in LA and if he doesnt it would teach the League a huge lesson about making trades like this in the future,"Here are some things to consider.

1.) Obviously Luka didn't choose to go to LA. Plus the state taxes will be way different than it is in Texas once he sees the difference in his pay.

2.) Lebron James realistically has about another 1 or 2 years to play good basketball. That's if Father Time decides that even if LeBron wanted to play at a high level at some point his body's going to give out whether he wants it to happen or not.

3.) The Lakers don't really have a sense of direction right now and will realistically have to depend on free agency. Even if they were to make the playoffs this year, they won't go far. Luka just went from a contender team to a team trying to find an identity after trading their second Superstar.

4.) Luka will finally have a decision as to where he will want to play even though we know Dallas would have been his first choice. If he does choose to sign with la, it will likely be a short-term deal in order to get to his 10 years to get the supermax ",0,32,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ii9yy7/i_know_it_hurts_to_see_luka_traded_but_its_still/,2025-02-05 08:31:11,"Aren’t there very few teams with cap space to sign him, and most of those teams are very bad? The Spurs seemed like the only real option, but not sure if it is possible with the Daron Fox contract || 1. Endorsements will more than make up tax differences, it’s LA lol

2. Max Cap space, do you think nobody would want to play in LA with fucking Luka doncic?

3. Their direction is having a generational 25 year old. Also “Even if they make the playoffs this year” lmao, they’re a game out of a top 4 seed, just smacked the Celtics/knicks/clippers. This part just makes this post read like cope.

4. Yes

Sure, there are ways this doesn’t work out, but No matter what happens with Luka there’s not a single team that won’t take a “risk” for trading for a player like him no matter how this turns out, you’re kidding yourself. || Sure, as a Celtics fan it would be the funniest thing, but even if he doesn’t re-sign with the Lakers you still do that deal 100 times out of 100 as the Lakers. There had been no rumors about trading AD previously, and they wouldn’t have been able to get much for him anyways. Getting Luka for AD is by far the best deal they would’ve ever gotten. || Tax won't matter because of endorsement. Lebron is in LA because of the money and connection too.

Once lebron retire, they'll get another star

Most of the laker players are 24-28 Dalton, Reaves, Vando, Rui, Gabe (all movable, cheap, short contracts) while only missing 2 FRP in the next 7 yrs. And if you think they won't go far in the PO with Bron AND Luka, then you haven't been watching the Lakers  

Why will he sign back with Dallas? The franchise that doesnt really want him? They need to change owner for him to rejoin that circus || Bron joins Lebois Ad and Kyrie this summer and Luka joins Wemby and Fox the next summer. All happy. || I agree with pretty much everything you’ve said here, but cmon. It’s the Lakers. They do right by their stars and are one of the only teams that could realistically build through free agency.

That said, if the Heat have max cap space, I think there’s a possibility he could sign there. They definitely have a more promising roster and the word in Mavs circles was always that Luka was interested in living in Miami. || I feel like you don’t really watch the lakers lol they basically tied with the nuggets in seeding with the same losses. They are 8-2 in their last 10 games. Just won against a hot knicks team and wrecked the clips without AD.

No matter where Luka goes, tax included, won’t more more than the 120mill Dallas screwed out of him || I genuinely don't understand why people find it so unthinkable that Luka would want to test out FA. The fact that this deal was done so abruptly and suddenly meant that Luka and his manager had zero leverage or ability to even say ""hey, if the mavericks want me gone, here's where i'd like to be."" They (as in both sides- lakers AND mavs) explicitly did it this way *so* Luka would have zero agency/leverage to ask for anything or see where else he could be a good fit.

I don't know why he would completely forego the option to test out FA given that he was deprived of any say in this trade. Someone like Fox atleast got to make the trade request, say where he wanted to go and Kings/Spurs made it happen. But Luka's trade happened like this specifically to deprive him of any ability to have a say in things. It is not unthinkable for me that he'd want to have a say and feel like FA is the way to go about it. || 1. Luka is making obscene amounts of money and I expect the endorsements being the superstar of the Lakers will more than cover the tax differences.

2. Not sure what LeBron has to do with Luka playing in LA.

3. The Lakers are one of the most sought after FA destinations, they can and will surround Luka with enough talent to compete.

4. I can't remember the last time a young athlete took a short term deal instead of locking in for as many years as they could, especially if they are going to be at the max anyways. Turning down guaranteed money is a risk. || yeah no, man, you're coping way too hard. there's no real reason to believe that luka won't extend in LA. yeah we're finding our identity, but its not like we're a terrible team right now. the mavs weren't doing too hot even when luka was healthy. 

i believe luka can see the long term vision, and he knows that he can sign long term contracts with the lakers to eventually have as much money as he wants. 

the lakers are counting on lebron retiring eventually, and being being players in the FA market. i don't see whats wrong with that. players and roleplayers will want to come to LA with the amount of cap space we're scheduled to have in a couple years, and for the opportunity to play with luka in his prime.

the mavs were *not* legit contenders lol. there's no universe in which the mavs are doing anything against a healthy okc team. even if by some fluke they made it to the finals again, not only are the celtics still as good as last year, the cavs are maybe even better than that. 

i'm sure dallas would have been his first choice up till a week ago, but now that he's in LA, and he builds a culture and legacy here, there's really no reason for him to want to go back to dallas. for one thing, the FO is entirely incompetent and they've snubbed him horribly. but even if that wasn't the case, kyrie klay and AD are all aging. dallas is going to be collapsing in a couple years while the lakers are going to be building a contender around luka. once luka signs the extension to get to the 10 years, he'll sign the vet max in la which'll recoup the potential money he's losing this offseason.

everything so far gives me an indication that luka is genuinely looking to leave his mark here and build a legacy. he's aiming to be a top 15+ player of all time, and the best way to do that is to stick it out in one place for as long as possible.

also, even if luka doesn't extend, hypothetically (which i *highly* doubt, but still), the lakers will easily just do the bidding war in the trade market that the mavs should've done. they'll get a big haul of picks and young stars in exchange for a year or so of luka, and offloading an aging AD. that's more than fair (although it's probaly not going to happen) || This applies to most teams that would’ve potentially traded for him. He can opt out following next season, and who knows how many of the remaining ~30 games this year he’s even healthy for. 

Like I personally would’ve traded Banchero plus however many picks to beat the Lakers’ offer, but Orlando between free agency/salary cap concerns plus overrating Banchero for being ‘their guy’ wouldn’t, and then even from Dallas’s perspective that’s a half-assed move because Paolo is way worse than AD now and wouldn’t have that much help in the future because the Mavs aside from Lively (who’s injured rn) are old and have traded future picks to build their current roster - that’s not competing with teams like Houston, Memphis, and San Antonio that are obviously set up super well for the future.

All these other management types are barking about how unfair it is they didn’t get to bid when they wouldn’t have actually given up that much for potentially a one-season rental. I would also say that if Dallas’ ownership did not want to pay him a supermax he assuredly would have taken that as an insult and wanted out. You can it was dumb/they cheaped out to not want to supermax him, but once that decision is made by ownership your hands are pretty much tied as a GM. || [removed] || Fox contract expires in the same offseason as Luka’s. That said, assuming Luka actually want to go to Spurs, they will just do sign-and-trade with Lakers for Fox: that way LAL still get a quality and still young guard for their retool instead of losing Luka for nothing.

Miami will also have cap space in 2026 and can have Luka join Herro and Bam who are roughly his age and they are missing that alpha level playmaker.

Nuggets will do literally anything legal (and probably a few illegal things too) to free up cap space should Luka be available: that’s only fair for them to give their biggest player in history in Jokic a chance to play with his best basketball friend.

I’m sure half of the league will be looking into making cap space available should there be indications that Luka is to go into FA: he is literally the biggest potential FA since LBJ if we take into account his off the court pull. But right now ball is in Lakers court, if they make correct moves over the next 6-9 months, he probably will stay. || Maaaan, imagine having Luka + Wenby in the same team. That will the futur dynastie of the league after the warriors, and probably will be the#1 cause of heart attack in Dallas. || how do the heat have a more promising roster? bam is supposed to be in his prime but he looks washed, tyler herro is doing great but if they want to take on luka's contract, he'll be making way too much money. in fact, i feel like the entire franchise is collapsing tbh. terry rozier is awful too. i guess jaime and jovic are somewhat intriguing, but i dont think they're necessarily championship calibre roleplayers to the point that luka would want to hop teams. || but *why*? i can't think of too many reasons. i think hteres a 0% chance he ever goes back to dallas, but what reason would he have to leave LA at this point? he has an opportunity to play a couple years with lebron while the lakers put a championship roster around him, he gets to play for a franchise which will attract loads of talent in FA, and again, it *is* the lakers. Luka said he likes the ocean in the press conference lmfao. I think at this moment, he's completely dialed in on winning a championship, and i genuinely think that being in LA puts him in the best position to do that. || 4. Doncic is in a unique situation here:

A) Other players always extend on the max they are eligible for, so they do max duration too.

B) Luka would have done the same, but now he is screwed out of supermax extension with that trade, meaning he will only make a normal max: that’s 100M left on the table over 5 years.

C) With that in mind, it makes sense to sign a 2 year extension in 2026 first, get to 10 years of service and again qualify for a veteran supermax and then finally lock-in for 5 years. This way he maximises the money he makes by being on a standard max for 2 years only instead of 5 and then getting absolutely most money possible; not to mention it is easier for teams to justify giving him veteran supermax at 29 than it would be at 32. || Dwight Howard left, just to answer your question, with Steve Nash(aged), Kobe and Pau Gasol on the team. But yeah i agree with you overall. || Please keep your comments civil. This is a subreddit for thoughtful discussion and debate, not aggressive and argumentative content. || exactly. the lakers do a lot of things wrong, but their stars aren't one of them. especially, with how aware rob and jeanie seem of who they have (as opposed to nico lol), i'm sure they'll throw everything at luka to convince him to stay (although he probably will of his own volition) || Shaq did in 2004: even if you think it was back-end of his prime, he still finished 2nd in MVP voting in his 1st season in Miami.

Kobe was THIS close to leaving, but shrewd trades saved his legacy in LA: should Rob pull out another rabbit out of his hat, Luka will similarly stay, but if Lakers stay put and don’t try to be aggressive, Doncic may be out in a 1.5 year. || Luka and Jokic would be a team that wins almost every game with a score of 140-135 || Ware, Jaime, Jovic, Herro, and Bam are all interesting players. You’re probably right that they would have to move Herro or Bam if they realistically wanted to sign Luka, but even then they probably have four players that could be seen as long term building blocks. 

Outside of Reaves and maybe Knecht, i don’t think the Lakers have any long term pieces. They also have leveraged all of their trade-able picks until 2031 || It’s essentially replacing Murray with Luka: it’s not like Jamal is some excellent defender as is. 

They would have an even more potent offense while defense would stay relatively the same or maybe even improve a bit: Luka’s advanced defensive stats are better than Murray’s. || you don't think DFS, Vando, or Rui are good long term pieces around Luka? shit, i guess we'll have to agree to disagree, because i think with a 3&D guard and a good center rotation, the lakers are much closer to being contenders than people realize.

and i imagine that the lakers will build through FA since we have a lot of expiring contracts around 2026 and 2027. || Oh I wasn’t poo pooing it, it would be a super fun team to watch and if the Nuggets got the opportunity they should take it.

They’d also just need to make sure they pick up another couple bodies who play good D to help out. || DFS is awesome but definitely too old to be considered a long term piece imo.

Vando is the type of player I could see Luka elevating, but he’s not a good offensive player and misses a ton of games. 

Rui is a solid piece, I forgot about him tbh. Again, this is probably a player Luka could elevate. He’s probably the closest to a long term piece after Reaves. 

And yea, I said in my original post that I certainly would not bet against the Lakers being able to successfully build thru free agency, they’re the Lakers! And now they have Luka! They will probably figure it out || all fair points."
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-02-04,nbadiscussion,1ihruk4,How rare are NBA stars?,"The NBA promotes the best players in the league. I wondered how rare it was to be a star player. I did a quick calculation. Most NBA teams have at least 1-2 ""Stars"" on their rosters. I averaged it out to be 1.5 stars per team and multiplied the result by 30 and got the number 45. Since 15 roster spots is the max for NBA rosters, the estimated total number of NBA players in the league is 450. 45/450 divides perfectly into the top 10% of the league. 150 starters and 300 reserves. There are only 24 spots for the NBA all-star game each season. 24/ 45 estimated ""Stars"" comes to little over 53% of NBA stars in the league actually make the team. I can easily why someone like Trae Young and Damian Lillard didn't make the team despite being some of the best players in the league at their position. I'm sure there were other good players in NBA history who didn't make an All-star team or made it once simply because there are only so many spots to get.

Only 459 NBA players in the history of the game have made the all-star game at least once. 315 of those 459 made the team more than once. I saw an estimated number that said about 4,800 players have ever played in the NBA since it's inception! Pretty amazing. And if you divide 459/4800. You'll get a number just under 10%.

The math shows you how much of an outlier Lebron James is and how good you have to be just to get on an NBA roster and just to be the best out of the ones who make the NBA.

Any thoughts??",11,15,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ihruk4/how_rare_are_nba_stars/,2025-02-04 15:39:41,"its kinda hard to uniformally estimate the number of stars because different teams are in different states that warrant different # of star players. Like the rockets are coming off a rebuild and dont actually have a defined ""star"" player on a consistent basis, but thats different from the situation in orlando where there is a 1a/1b, which is also different from the situation in boston, which is also different from what we got in LA, etc. Its even harder to estimate this across eras where teams used to start people that were absolutely useless on offense too, and a lof teams in purgatory or the basement would still have nobody.

  
tl;dr stars are even rarer than you think || It’s also interesting to note because based on these calculations while the lifetime number may be 9-10%, the league has had a surplus of stars only recently. The number of stars per year has historically been lower with players developing faster and staying around longer. || I would argue its not about skill it is about revenue generation.  A star player sells jerseys.  A star player sells away tickets.  A star player sells sold out home games.  A community can support a player by all those metrics and have them be a star, and its an entertainment profit driven league, so that is your star player.  If people are willing to pay to see that player, they are a star.  There is no metric that matters more because if they are willing to pay to see, they are willing to buy merch and they are willing to tune in, and that is all that matters to the NBA. || My thoughts are, thats a lot of maths! lol, seriously though, yeah making it to the NBA and becoming a star is super rare. There's so much that needs to go into that, and to stay at that level, even beyond just basketball or talent. And we're just talking about All-star teams here too, let alone All-NBA players like Sabonis that get snubbed. || Thoughts? 🤔

Didnt lillard make the all star team this year? 

Why you got him as not making it? 🤷‍♂️ || NBA Star player is like different tiers. LeBron Steph Jokic  and Giannis too I’d say are all the stars of the league and bring in money. They are known worldwide as well.  Guys like Ant , Tatum , SGA are also “ stars “ in a skill wise but not in the way like the other guys. It’s kinda like how when you think of soccer stars you auto think of CR7 and Messi because they are the biggest names / stars ever although there are out of prime and there are lot of stars right now like Mbappe Vini who are better currently. || Not all stars are made the same.

There are players like Draymond Green who were technically stars who have no place in an All-Star game.

That's not what people come to watch.

Trae Young should 100% be in the All-Star game Lamelo Ball also.

You don't go to an All-Star game to watch Evan mobley or Tyler Herro || Yea, it is because there is no truly objective way to define a star player. Sometimes, a player is just the best player on a bad team. When he gets traded to another team, he becomes an average player.

Also , 10 years ago KD was very popular as well.

LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-02-19,nbadiscussion,1iu0as7,Has Father Time finally caught LeBron James?,"LeBron James. Age 40. Season 22. No one in the game has had this kind of longevity. The only player who came close to this is Kareem. (Sidebar: I'll always find it curious how few people called Kareem the GOAT based on longevity when MJ was around, but now call LeBron the GOAT based on longevity... But I digress..).

Even at age 40, Bron is continuing to stuff the stat sheet. Let's look at the basic, raw box stats:

24.3 PPG (51.5/39.4/76.1)
7.7 RPG
9.0 APG

Age 40 and he's doing this? Looks incredible!

Now let's start looking beneath the surface. At efficiency and impact on the game.

Per DunksAndThrees:
OffEPM 2.5 (33rd in the NBA)
DefEPM -0.5 (300th in the NBA)
EPM 2.1 (54th in the NBA, basically tied with Austin Reaves)

Offense is chugging along, but the defense is gone. He's 40 and playing one side of the court to conserve energy. Makes sense, I guess.

Now for on court impact (per Cleaning the Glass):

Efficiency differential -8.1 (team points scored per 100 possessions minus team points allowed per 100 possessions). -8.1 puts LeBron in the 15th percentile in the NBA in efficiency differential and is the lowest of his entire career by far. In fact, he's NEVER been negative in this. Even as a rookie he was +1.9. And just last season LeBron was +8.3 and in the 88th percentile in the league.

Expected wins -19 (How many games would a team win in an 82 game season with this efficiency differential?). Once again, he's negative for the first time in his career. Just last season his expected wins was +20.

Points per 100 possessions: -3.5. Again, the first time he's been negative for points per 100 possessions in his entire career. -3.5 points/poss is the 28th percentile in the league.

Across the board, it looks like his efficiency and impact have fallen off a cliff, despite the solid raw box counting stats. Which brings us to last night...

Hornets vs Lakers: A Closer Look.

People are criticizing Luka. Especially a lot of Bron fans. And I get it. Luka's raw box score numbers looked terrible! And Bron's raw box score numbers looked pretty good. But let's dig a little deeper again and check impact.

Luka on: +17.1 Net. Luka off: -41.2 Net.
Bron on: -5 Net. Bron off: +10.6 Net.

Holy shit. The Lakers were +10.6 Net with Bron off the floor? And they were -41.2 Net with Luka off the floor, but +17.1 Net with Luka on it? Shocking.

In short, raw box scores can be very deceiving. You can score all the points you want, but if you do so inefficiently and/or play no defense, it won't matter much in terms of actually impacting winning games. It's been said that ""every team has a leading scorer, even the bad ones."" 

It's hard not to come away with the conclusion that Father Time has indeed caught up with LeBron, but it's not reflected in raw box scores (posted from Real and elsewhere). It's reflected in efficiency and impact. LeBron is getting his numbers, but at what cost to the team? 

The Lakers have a great record so far, but that was Anthony Davis around, who is one of the best defenders in the NBA. The perfect counterpart for a 40 year old LeBron who coasts on defense to save energy. Now LeBron is paired up with Luka, who, if anything, is a lot like him. A ball dominant, one way player. They have time to figure things out, but losses to the Jazz and Hornets could be a sign of things to come. The Lakers have had one of the easiest schedules in the league up until this point. They now have the 6th toughest remaining schedule strength. This could get ugly, quickly (we're already seeing people throwing Luka under the bus).",0,21,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iu0as7/has_father_time_finally_caught_lebron_james/,2025-02-20 09:54:38,"Father Time has slowed him down to a degree and we see that with LeBron not being able to do the hard carry through all the injuries and now trying to allow Luka to get back into playing shape while being comfortable with a new team. Things will come together as they get more reps and find that comfort level between LeBron, Luka, and the Lakers kind of find their way. Without AD the Lakers just went on a great run and are at worst an above average team still || For the first time in a long, long time LeBron has no pressure to win. I'm a Lakers fan, we're rocking a center rotation of Hayes and Len. We absolutely will not win anything with those 2 playing real minutes. Trading AD for Luka made us worse in the short-term but much, much better long-term.

I've seen a tonne of LeBron basketball. He's been in decline for a bit. He's 40 that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. I do think right now, the way he plays regular season basketball is hurting his team. I also don't think it really matters, for the reasons mentioned above. The real test will be his impact in meaningful games, based on what I saw at the Olympics I definitely think LeBron can be the #2 option on a very good basketball team. The Lakers have their eye on the future, so unfortunately we might have seen all the meaningful basketball were gonna get from LeBron. 10 finals appearances, a gazillion playoff games, he's given us more than we can ask. Time to just enjoy the end of the ride. || Use your eyes. Lebron is paired with the worse parts of the Lakers rotations. Charlotte hunted Luka to win the game. || > Offense is chugging along, but the defense is gone. He's 40 and playing one side of the court to conserve energy. Makes sense, I guess.

Old Kareem was that way too.  Seems like anyone at that age has either their offense or defense vanish, even if the other end stays at a high level.

For examples the other way, Tim Duncan and Karl Malone both were still great defenders in their final seasons, but their scoring ability had declined quite a bit. || Stats are very deceiving in the modern NBA. I think he should retire but he won't do that until after next season because Bronny is retiring that same year || LeBron can still play at the highest level possible and look like the best player in the world he just can’t do it all game anymore. The coasting on defense is most definitely helping mitigate his stamina and allowing him play defense and offense in the 4th when it really matters. I don’t really see him having an actual huge drop off but he will probably continue to slowly decline. I may get hate for this but I think with AD he would’ve been done in a year to two because bron was still having to run everything and AD doesn’t really control the offense. With Luka once he gets settled I can see lebron playing a lot more off ball and being a spot up shooter which should allow him to have more stamina for key moments. I also would think that this would extend how long he can and may want to play not having to put the entire team on his back every night. It’s also contingent on LA building a competent team around him and Luka where he can coast on defense and offense when needed. So yes I think Father Time has slowly started to catch up with him but it only really has changed how much of a game he can 100%. I still see him being a mid 20s and 7+ plus assist and rebound a night guy years down the line if he doesn’t have to carry the team like he has to do most do his career. || Anything to deflect the blame off the guy charlottes was hunting last night. || On the defensive end yes. On the offensive end not very much. He’s even a better 3pt shooter now than he ever was || While it’s obvious that this is the worst season LeBron has played in his career and his defense is probably the worst it’s ever been, I think these advanced stats actually do a worse job of telling the story than traditional box scores do. The Lakers currently have an inefficient, out of shape co-star that is still building chemistry and a below average bench. LeBron currently leads the lakers in minutes per game and according to nbarotations.info, usually takes the floor again without Reaves and Rui, who provide quality defense and open up the floor for different offensive scenarios. Comparing efficiency and +/- is useful when looking at an individual team and determining rotations, but you lose a lot of context when you compare between teams. To me, looking at these numbers knowing LeBron plays significant minutes with lesser talent on the floor shows that the team feels LeBron offers enough upside to give the other players a rest. If LeBron only played with the best lineups, his numbers would be better. You can say LeBron no longer “elevates” his teammates or makes up for a bad roster like he used to, but at the end of the day looking at a guy comparing these numbers for a guy who takes the court with Christian Koloko and Shake Milton is going to have worse numbers by default than say, a guy who is on a team like the Knicks who keep their rotations much tighter. || And he just had another 40 point game after this last night lmao. If anything he’s somehow better than his age 39 season? || I'm late to this discussion but there is another layer to this.   On pbpstats Lebron's 3 point shooting luck when on and off the court is quite unlucky.  When Lebron is on the court, his teammates even on open possessions have forgotten how to shoot.  On the court, they go nuclear from 3.  Swings like this happen all time.  SGA's season is getting juiced even more than it should be by 3 point shooting luck when he is on and off the court in the reverse direction.  Lebron has benefitted from these swings at various times in his career, but this isn't the first time it has happened, but it is the most dramatic example.  In 2018 he almost had a negative on/off.  EPM and DRtg capture this and make his defense look a lot worse than it actually is in this particular season.  It has started to normalize though. || All this advanced stats go out of the window if you watch games but why do that right, no seriours person will watch the last Lakers game and say that Luka was better than LBJ.

In short advanced stats can be deceiving as well if you are using them to further our own agenda and throw context out of the window.

Lakers started they best run when they went small and AD was out.

But not much is expected of a dude who is a Warriors fan and spends his time on reddit hating on LeBron (in order to prop Curry ) and using kindergarten talking points.

And the most hilarious is trying to mask it as thoughful discussion in this sub.

One other thing that is funny is that since Lebron took a week off he has been balling and pushing his team into the standings. || It's a great analysis by OP. LeBron is slowing down. A lot of turnovers. Passing like crap. Little to no defense. Father Time is undefeated. What happens next is nagging small injuries pile up or a devastating Achilles or knee injury occurs or both.

LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-02-22,nbadiscussion,1iwkh1h,I’m fascinated by the operations and administration side of an NBA team,"Does anyone have information, a book would be awesome, about the administration side of an NBA team?

Does LeBron James have a Lakers email account? LeBron.james@lakers.com

If a team needs to reschedule a practice or flight, are they texting the players? Are they emailing the players? Is it communicated through a player’s manager/agent? Is JJ texting Luka about the change in practice schedule? 

Does Steph Curry pick out his own shoes? I know he has final say, obviously. But, today he’s wearing one blue shoe and one yellow shoe. Does under armor give him a few options and he picks which one to wear?

I work in non-profit operations so I’m really interested in how organizations operate behind the scenes. The NBA is unique but it’s famously a business too. Any place I can learn more about this side of the league?",153,22,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iwkh1h/im_fascinated_by_the_operations_and/,2025-02-23 16:02:28,"As far as logistics go, a lot of teams use the Teamworks app for scheduling and keeping players updated.

Here's a link in Google Play but there's an iOS version too.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamworks.twmobile.next || My wife's cousin (my MIL's brother's son) is an MLB player..It's super complicated.

But for a lot of your questions, the team communicates with the players just like your bosses communicate with you.

There's a team of people that handle communications, hotel arrangements, visitor requests, special arrangements. They'll even take your dogs for a few days on a road trip if you've got nobody home to take care of them. || Check out sports business classroom: https://www.sportsbusinessclassroom.com/

Only thing I've seen really geared towards the admin side of things. || I've also been interested in team logistics, equipment managers and travel logistics for all sports, draft war rooms, Olympic team gear hauls, things like that.


There's a channel on YouTube that used to visit a bunch of different team equipment managers. Shoe-wise, I think it depends on relationships between players and shoe companies (ie who sponsors a player). For sponsored players, they may know the kinds of shoes they like and make sure they send those, plus others to test out. Additionally, I think the companies send a bunch of shoes to teams for non sponsored players to pick from. And non sponsored players might be able to make requests, too (I don't know for sure though). At the end of the year, players have a bunch of shoes left over that they have shipped to their homes.


As with everything, it's all pretty logistically organized and streamlined so players don't need to think too much, except for what they have at home to support their job (ie the decision to have a personal chef, in-home gym, etc). Once they make decisions, there are many resources available from the team, the league, and good agents, to help them get things done.


Players and staff also have group chats which fills several purposes, but specifically when it comes to logistics, helps them organize get togethers (ie on Old Man and the Three, they had Jaren Jackson and Desmond Bane on, and they were asked a question about Steven Adams, and one of the stories was of a get together at assistant coach's house Darko (now HC at Toronto) where his gf cooked up a meal for Adams before the get together where he had several more chicken breasts. That's the sort of stuff that group chats would facilitate.


What was most interesting to me when I was first interested in team logistics, was all the stuff players travel with on the road. It isn't just what the social media shows with one carryon and a backpack. They carry PS4s; personal massage kits and cryo kits for their legs or arms or whatever, even torsos; podcasting gear; all sorts of stuff to make their lives easier and more comfortable on the road.


Equipment staff usually takes care of a ton of things and have to do so at the visiting arena a certain fixed time before the team arrives, so often they go straight to the arena upon landing, and there is a logistics side there to how many copies of different jerseys and equipment to bring depending on how long the trip is, I think including sewing (or maybe the home team lets them use their sewing as a reciprocated courtesy), in case of a new player that arrives midway during a road trip. They have to be prepared for every. Thing. And that brings up reciprocated services and hospitality by all home teams, where they let visiting teams, and players away from their teams, use their weight rooms, and I know the team I root for lets other players come by just whenever (within reason), especially if someone is rehabbing but coming through town for whatever reason, and wants to use the training facilities, the team tries to accommodate them. Probably not medical staff, but just like the ice tubs after a weight room or shooting round. And I suspect that is not uncommon. Just need to communicate with the team ahead of time. || Recommended videos/channels to learn more about the logistics would be Royal Key/Coiski Media they have a lot of vlogs on touring the facilities with operation and equipment managers of professional sports and college teams. They also have vlogs on nutrition/wellness executives on how they prepare food for teams especially for college teams. Some NBA team vlogs have specific videos on Game Day prep with the equipment operations teams from ingress and egress of games and this shows how spoiled NBA teams are where these dudes behind the scenes barely sleep especially on those back-to-backs and late flights. There are also vlogs on team security staff of the Milwaukee Bucks making sure that things don't escalate on-court and coordinating with the logistics/operations teams on team security when moving in and out of cities.

Most of the equipment operation guys started out as ball-boys and eventually move up or were Assistants and the job is taxing one, given how big egos are in a pro sports team. They would need to know literally hundreds of items from socks, shirts, compression (pants, sleeves, tops, shirts, hybrids where one sleeve is longer), braces, shorts, multiple-colored jerseys, headbands, practice shirts, shorts, pants, tank tops, and A LOT of SHOES). 

When the NBA changed their rules of allowing teams/players to wear shoes that are not limited to primarily being their team's colorways, this also added another dynamic layer of logistics for them since they would need to consider the number of pairs each player has. Adding to the issue would be teams with multiple signature athletes, coordinating with their brands for specific colorways/releases ex. Christmas Day, MLK day, All-Star, Playoffs and etc. Normally a lot of players who aren't necessarily signed to a brand ex. Nike can easily request through the equipment team for specific customizations if they have bigger sizes beyond 16 or 17 or they would most likely have brand reps who would offer teams discounts on shoes/colorways that were mostly evident prior to the NBA attire/fashion rule change where shoes like Hyperdunks would be in team colors. 

They would also need to have multiple back-ups, of each item, and they must prepare and collect dirty gear and get them clean while the team is travelling, and this requires a lot of coordination with the other team's opponent if they are in the road and they assist each other with laundry and getting their gear in place in the arena or even practice facilities.

For team operations outside of the equipment, they definitely have internal team roles who handle the back-office/internal activities that a team does. It could range from sales/marketing, analytics, operations (including equipment managers), HR, administrative, finance and accounting, PR, communications which you would normally see in a typical corporate office and these roles are mostly non-basketball related. 

Hope this helps since I'm also a big fan of the NBA beyond the basketball aspects! || I was a security guard a few years ago for MLSE and Masai Ujiri would often leave his office door open so I would have to go in and close it but he had business cards with a common email on it, pictures of his family on his desk and a parking space with his name. Downstairs of his office is the leafs office, and around draft time they had a war room with players they wanted just written on a white board and after the draft they used the war room to discuss free agents they wanted to sign and what they expected them to get and what they were willing to pay for the free agents. It's pretty common that it runs just like a regular office. Fridges, lunch rooms, merch. But the raptors don't really have their own parking lot, they have Biometrics to get into locker rooms and practice court on the top floor of the Scotiabank arena. If the player doesn't have their ID card, then they have to go through a different entrance. I remember being at a door on an off day and 3 raptors walked in and very very politely asked if they can go to the gym upstairs and work out. I didn't recognise them because they weren't starters or anything n were in street clothes and I was like ""naw that's just for players"", and they told me their names and the guard I was with said ""y'all play for the raptors?"" And they laughed and politely said yeah we play for the raptors. Looked at their ID and called it in and they got an escort upstairs. Their locker rooms are pretty small to be fair, leafs one is cool but basic for it being a billion dollar franchise. Media room is just an open space with a drinks fridge and food set out.

And also, this has nothing to do with anything but when I worked there it was 2 or 3 years after the championship and there was NOT A SINGLE picture of kawhi Leonard in the entire arena. Pictures of the parade, no Kawhi, draft picks, no Kawhi, random players, no Kawhi. And they meet every year and discuss the pictures in the arena so it's a conscious decision to not put Kawhi in the building. || I was curious about logistics around a player being traded and found this interesting article ok group chats in the NBA

Not really you’re question but still may intrigue you. || yeah I've always wondered how they specifically get paid. Are dudes just getting like 1 million direct deposited every two weeks? I mean I guess so but it just feels so crazy that's how it would be done. || If you’re interests exceed just the game of basketball and include pretty much pro sports as a whole, David Samson is a former GM and president of OPs for the Malrins. Sure it’s MLB but he has a podcast and he often goes on other pods like Lebatard Show to discuss the ins and outs of running a sports team. From how people learn they are traded and report to their new team, to how a team gets an arena approved and funded. It’s called Nothing Personal. || I love this question because I'm fascinated by it as well. In fact, during my (failed) degree in International Business Studies I worked out a case-study with a local football (soccer) club. This was the early 2000s in the Netherlands, but it is so much more complex than you'd imagine.

For example in football, the team manager is not the 'coach' (the man they call manager in football), it's a dedicated role and they are often supported by an assistant. Their role is to plan all logistics. Getting a football team with 30 people from one city to the other in the Netherlands is relatively easy, you hop on a bus and drive. But you also need all the kit, all the documentation, the hotel sorting, the fitness suite sorting, physio rooms etc. etc. They had check-lists for everything and these were constantly changed to meet emerging requirements, like a player needing sports tape or changing dietary requirements.

Between clubs, things are arranged with 'riders' like music acts and actors do as well, the hosting club describes what facilities will be available to the visiting team. But it's on a 'like for like' basis. If the team you are visiting is only providing you with bare necessities... well, then you only provide them with that when they return, right? There's a lot of unspoken rules and gentleman's agreements involved. 

Hotels tend to be booked as soon as the schedule is known and each club has good contacts with particular hotels/chains. Back then the team I studied had an agreement with Van der Valk hotels, a big chain in the Netherlands. They had just got quite far into the cup and were playing a team at the other side of the country, but all hotels were fully booked due to another major event in the area. So Van der Valk arranged a bunch of caravans on a nearby camping for the team to stay in. Apparently it wasn't very comfortable because they lost that game 3-1.

Training/exercise is run by the coaches/actual manager. But again, not in the way you'd necessarily expect. Every month they decide on the 'agenda' in a big meeting with the captain of the team, the physios/sports scientists. But I learned that it is different for each manager. Some prefer lots of team focussed training and a lot of team-wide stamina/cardio training, others draw up seperate schedules for sections of the team (defenders, attackers, midfielders etc.) and adapted for each player's individual needs. It is super intricate and I can only imagine that in the last 20 years that has only become more complicated. Add in that in the NBA the players have a huge say, many have their own personal trainers/chefs etc. So I think it's probably quite different in the NBA in that sense. 

Oh, before I forget, discipline was a huge eye-opener for me as well. The team agree fines at the start of the season, being late, swearing, smoking and drinking (a player told me a brilliant anecdote of being out in the city after a big win with a couple of others, they were drinking and pretty drunk on the main square, partying with fans, when the manager and assistant coach spotted them. Big no no! Cost them €1300 each, which was a week's wages at the time! Funniest thing: The manager was completely blottoed himself) but it's actually the team-captain that is in charge of that. He collects the money and depending on how much there is at the end of the season either organises a massive party, donates to a charity of his choice or a combination of the two. || That's a very interesting topic for me. Like, does LeBron have a company phone? Does he need to go through mandatory courses so he doesn't click on a phishing email and get hacked? || So LeBron exchanges emails, text messages, phone calls, Teams messages, in-person meetings, virtual meetings, and hand written post it notes with JJ. || I’d love to see the spreadsheets equipment managers have to track the extra gear each player wears. Arm bands. Wrist bands. Headbands. Shooting sleeves. Leggings. One-leg leggings. Knee pads. Mouth guards. The list goes on and on. || This is super helpful. I’ll check out those videos. Thanks. || That was interesting. It’s funny to read an article from 2019 that talks about group chats like they are some great advancement in technology. My favorite was the mention of players forming group chats to discuss teaming up in free agency with the implication it’s scandalous. || They only get paid during the season so it’s their annual salary divided by the number of payments in a season. But yes, otherwise it’s just a normal payroll. || It would make sense to me have a couple “player relationship” managers that just say “hey plane leaves at 6p lmk if you need a car or you’ll be driving, trip is 8 days” 

But at lebrons level, his assistant probably deals with everything || Yes. And the staff, the trainers, the medical team.

When I get tickets to go watch games, my wife's cousin texts the fan relations person directly.

Well, LeBron may not... But my wife's cousin makes $20M+, and he does. || I love the idea of LeBron losing access to his Cavalier’s email account when he left the team. || In the NBA they typically place ticket holds for every game. Players usually buy from that at a discounted rate

The cool thing is that they also have an internal bidding system for tickets for anyone associated and working with the league. So say you want to catch the Bulls vs Hornets in Chicago. Instead of buying a ticket, you can place a bid for a ticket and say I only want to pay $30 for it. They’ll go down the list of bids and give out whatever is left from their allotment to the highest bidders

If it’s a game that in high demand, there’s also the option of putting requests into a suite"
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-02-27,nbadiscussion,1j0hguj,The Luka Lakers Are Figuring It Out... Thanks to LeBron's evolution from his heliocentric role into a 0.5 battering ram.,"The morning I filled in for Adam Mares on the All-NBA podcast with Tim Legler, I watched Los Angeles lose to Charlotte. As I took notes and pulled clips, I could only feel disbelief at how clunky the Los Angeles offense looked with two players trying to play the same role: heliocentric alpha.

LeBron James and Luka Doncic have thrived in this role throughout their NBA careers. They’re the basketball version of grandmasters chess players. They’ve seen every coverage under the sun, can make every shot/read in the book, and they both know how to move the pieces around the basketball chessboard with precision and ease.

Thanks for reading Low Man Help! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.

But like [Highlander, there can be only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcLjcSloXs), and as to the question of who would be that *one* for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

Players often say they want to win, but they really mean, “I want to win, but I want to do it playing my way.”

The Charlotte game felt like a line of demarcation for this team. Two heliocentric grandmaster chess players wouldn’t give them the best chance to win, so an evolution had to happen.

**Two BIG things have stood out to me since that Charlotte game:**

1. LeBron’s shift into a 0.5 Player
2. The Roberson Rule

**LeBron’s Final Act:**

LeBron James has shifted from the only role he’s ever known in the NBA into a 0.5 player[1](#footnote-1). This is a massive step for someone of his caliber; he’s undoubtedly one of the top players to play this game.

Since the clunky Charlotte game, Los Angeles has won four games in a row, three of which have featured both James and Doncic. In those three victories, James recorded his two lowest games of the season in average touch length and average dribbles per touch.

During the Los Angeles win over Denver, James set a season low for average touch length (2.892 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.83).

The Denver game was the only time during the 24/25 that he had been under three seconds per touch or two dribbles. Until the Los Angeles win over Minnesota, James again set a season low for average touch length (2.581 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.44).

The data indicates precisely what the eye test says: LeBron has shifted into the 0.5 player this team needed to reach its ceiling, and he and the Los Angeles Lakers are thriving!

**LeBron James Closeouts:**

* Before Luka: 1.033 Points Per Chance (52nd Percentile)
* After Luka: 1.351 Points Per Chance (87th Percentile)

One of the most significant benefits of James relinquishing the highlander role to Doncic has been seeing his first three steps transition from then defensive end to offense. James no longer waits for every outlet pass to control the chess board; he knows Doncic sees the same picture he does, so he gets on his horse and goes!

James has long been one of the league's best, if not its best athlete. However, creating offense in the NBA takes energy, and that burden fell on James more times than not. But with Doncic in Los Angeles, the on-ball burden is gone, and LeBron’s athleticism has been unleashed every play they’re on the court together.

**The Roberson Rule:**

JJ Reddick is using the NBA regular season as a defensive lab experiment. One theory he’s been beta testing is [Seth Partnow’s “Roberson Rule.”](https://x.com/SethPartnow)

The past week, Aaron Gordon, Russell Westbrook, Dante Exum, Naji Marshall, Jaden McDaniels, Jaylen Clark, and Tarrence Shannon Jr. have received Reddick's version of Partnow's Roberson Rule.

One of the things I always tell agents, scouts, or front office members when discussing shooting is that volume matters. Yes, it’s great to be a 40% shooter from the three-point line, but if the player turns down open → semi-open shots to pass or drive into traffic, the percentage doesn’t matter because they can be put into a box defensively.

The Roberson Rule is that box.

Since January 15th, Los Angeles has been first in defensive rating, opponents’ points in the paint, and opponents’ FG%. The results are straightforward; the lab experiment is working.

Reddick is unwilling to concede gravity to players he doesn’t believe will shoot enough volume to beat them. Instead, he chooses to shrink the defensive shell and shift more gravity to players who *can* beat Los Angeles, like Jokic, Kyrie, and Anthony Edwards.

# Ben Taylor showed what that extra gravity looks like when shifted towards a player (Jokic).

Even a few makes from Gordon and Westbrook didn’t shake his resolve in the Roberson Rule strategy; it takes volume. Your shooting gravity is not defined by your percentage but by a combination of three factors: Percentage, Volume, and Mechanics.

He knows that players who have never shot 15 threes in an NBA game don’t know how to deal with the emotional swings of missing nine threes and it still being a good thing for the team, and he’s betting on players not being able to step that far outside the Overton Window of volume.The Luka Lakers Are Figuring It Out...",1458,107,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j0hguj/the_luka_lakers_are_figuring_it_out_thanks_to/,2025-02-28 15:29:35,"Great article! As a Lakers fan the Roberson rule has been very noticeable on defense, taking away their best player (see the coverages on Jokic and Ant) in exchange for giving low volume shooters an open 3.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || Side note but remember the “lebron can’t play off ball narrative”

Like idk where the even came from. Ig cause he’s always been the guy with the ball in his hands so they just assume he can’t. Especially with how much his shooting has improved, he’s lethal off ball. Saves energy and now he can use it to get boards, play defense, etc. his vision allows him to be a menace when cutting to the basket too. || Could someone please explain what a “0.5 player” is? I may be missing something, but I read the article on substack and tried a google search and I have not found an explanation that matches the context here. || Just want to point out - We are talking about how a 40 yr old finally unleashed his athleticism. || This was a fun read. Great analysis. Makes a lot of sense with their new personnel being fast enough for a close out on those guys instead of a proper gravity cover. I’ll be on the lookout for this next game. || Great article - one of LeBron’s main strengths has always been how remarkably well rounded he is in his game, combined with his brain. Even with that, I’ve been suprised how fast he has essentially worked out off ball play with Luka - is there any historical parallels of anyone doing this before? || [removed] || [removed] || [removed] || LeBron is trusting Luka - it also gives LeBron more rest and energy to do more dirty work and make plays when it matters, at this age this helps him chill a bit more and dial it up when it matters. || This was a great read, esp as a Laker/Bron fan rooting for him get that last championship run. || [removed] || Hey correct me if I’m wrong please but it feels like Taylor Jenkins also loves the “Roberson rule” and as an all 82 grizzlies watcher it frustrates me more than anything. It worked great vs Jrue Holiday but since then it feels like we’ve been burnt more than helped. || Bro I fucking hate Dallas for this. I’m finally ready to protest something lol || Lebron is getting more catch and shoot 3 opportunities, quality looks made possible by Luka having so much gravity and being an elite passer.

Then of course Lebron can rim run and is one of the best in transition which is easy money for a full court passing threat like Luka

People are mentioning Luka’s shooting slump, which is normal after an injury, but when you realize how often he’s double teamed and blitzed that’s what creates shot quality for other guys || LeBron’s never actually been heliocentric. We’ve gotten too liberal with the word. He’s always given other guys the opportunity to create, he’s always been a good cutter, he’s always utilized some post ups if the guard doesn’t have many options, etc 

Ball dominant? Yes

Heliocentric? No || > But like Highlander, there can be only one, and as to the question of who would be that one for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

I kind of disagree with this framing, as if LeBron playing off ball is the result of Luka being the better player, which he hasn't been in LA so far. LeBron even ceded ball handling duties to Westbrook to become a screen and short roll player when they were in the lineup together. To me this arrangement is the result of LeBron covering up Luka's weakness as an off ball player in the same way he covered up Anthony Davis' weakness as an on ball player. 

Even at this age, LeBron has less weaknesses than Luka and can do everything well and is an elite play initiator and finisher. Depending on what he has on his team, he can do either. So he's adapting his game to utilize the strengths of his teammate because he can in a way less flexible players cannot. || This isn’t accurate.

Since Luka arrived, LeBron’s touches per game have actually increased from 85.6 to 91.2, along with his scoring, which has jumped from 24.5 to 28.2 points per game.

For context, LeBron’s 91.2 touches per game surpass Luka’s 78.2.

Luka has merely come in to play point guard and distribute the ball to LeBron, but he hasn’t yet been the “alpha” or “Highlander” on the Lakers. LeBron has found a way to maintain that role—despite the devastating impact of 0.74 fewer dribbles per touch (shocking!). || I think Denver can put lineups out there (sans Westbrook) where you won’t feel as comfortable as you did last game. 

I think as teams see this more, they'll try to adjust as best they can. 

Boston can handle this coverage (obviously). Doing this on Golden State is scary because even though Green can't shoot, he's always a threat to get into quick two-man game actions with Curry or Buddy, who you must be up at the level to prevent open shots. || Hard to play this defense against the Bucks. I've seen teams all year focus on taking Dame away but then there is Giannis. As for role players AJ Green will gladly jack up 10+ 3s. To a lesser extent so will GTJ and Lopez. Portis & Prince will throw up 10 3s if given open looks as well. || [removed] || Boston, Cleveland || They playing the avgs. || Fully healthy wolves can run a lineup of DDV, Ant, Jaden, Naz, Rudy.   That lineup will launch 3s if left open, that type of defense would have a strong possibility of being a catastrophic decision. || Nice article! My only suggestion would be to explain what a 0.5 man is. I had no idea and had to find that in the comments. The Roberson Rule at least gets explained in the tweet that you have linked in the article (but not here). || nice piece, def enjoyed!  || I was hoping your substack would define this, what is a 0.5 player exactly? || Great work man, posts like yours keep me coming back here. Well done!! || Agreed.  In hindsight, someone with that much knowledge on playmaking is going to be amazing off ball - knowing exactly where to go for other playmakers. || He played off ball with Wade quite a bit and was a menace. I don't know how anyone thought he'd struggle.  He shot 40% from 3 with Wade, albeit on low attempts. But he's definitely a better shooter now than in Miami. || it was never about “LeBron can’t play off-ball” but rather “it’s not worth letting someone else play on-ball instead of LeBron”. For the first time ever, there is a player LeBron is playing with who is better than him offensively and it now makes sense for LeBron to play off-ball. Before that, even the likes of Dwyane Wade and Kyrie Irving were not enough to overcome how much of a clear advantage it was to give LeBron the rock || It was because him playing off ball was always noticeably worse than him having the ball. Not because he was bad at it but because he’s top 2 all time at having the ball in his hands || People really said any old thing about LeBron, didn’t they? It’s pretty clear he became a primary ball handler because he had to and developed the skills accordingly. He never identified as a guard. || Bron does what he wants || The idea is you have to make a decision quickly(.5 seconds). So as soon as you catch, either pass shoot or attack. You hear the spurs and warriors talk about it a lot || Quick decisionmaking, whether it's moving the ball or moving forward with it or moving without the ball, to maintain whatever advantage the offense has and not let the defense get back into position. 

Beautiful game Spurs highlights will drive home just how significant it is, as they were able to have 5 lineups with guys playing that way at a high level. Part of the reason why a ""ball stopper"" has been so bad for an offense is because they're the antithesis of this, and even though that term is often used for players who are inefficient that negative effect can persist even when they're not. || I am also lost. cc: /u/low_man_help || I see this has been answered already. I just wanted to say thanks for reading, and I'll try to include a footnote next time about things like this. || I’m in the same boat here. || Pretty remarkable. || Thanks! I’m glad you enjoyed it. The Lakers have been fun to watch this past week, alot of times the Lakers defenders are 10+ feet away during the shots (per SS), a lot of “dare you to shoot” action going on. || I’m sure there’s an NBA parallel, but it reminds me of when dudes like Randall Cobb have been QB their entire life before becoming the slot WR in the NFL.

They didn’t forget how to play smart offense just because they’re now running hot routes instead of throwing them. || For a player of his stature, never. 

But this is also the first time a player like him has been paired with his air-apparent. So pretty unique all around. || [removed] || This sub is for serious discussion and debate.

Thanks! || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || I think that's spot on. 

People have asked him to do it for years, but he’s never trusted anyone to take on his role with the ball. 

^^ Because no one created the advantages others he did. Luka can make the same one. || The most famous picture of him and Wade on the Heat was LeBron being off-ball and Wade passing him an alley-oop on a hard cut. || In basketball, where the basketball is the center of the game, can you explain how being ball-dominant is not also being heliocentric? || This isn’t referencing one player being better or worse than the other. 

It’s more about a long-term organizational timeline—the 25-year-old with a 10+ year runway was always going to be the one to keep that role over a 40-year-old with a 1-4 year timeline. || The touches stat wasnt for the period since Luka arrived though, reread it || It kind of feels like you're just making my point further but somehow trying to be combative about it. Not sure why. || But then again if teams adjust their lineup to more offensive oriented line up to counter the Lakers defensive strat they will sacrifice their defense especially if you are up against 4 good offensive players in Luka/Lebron/Reaves/Rui.

Hope you're enjoying the pod and substack too! || Tbh while I was never in the “he can’t play off ball” camp, I didn’t think he’d be this good at it given his age.

I’m surprised how quickly Luka and Bron have clicked.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it!

0.5 = Drivble, pass, or shoot in 0.5 seconds. It's just the Spurs' way of saying keep pressing the advantage once it's created. || [removed] || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || Heliocentricity is when a player has *everything* revolve around them. The term originates from the belief of the universe revolving around the earth - everything around it

You can be a ball dominant player without literally having *everything* revolve around you

LeBron is ball dominant. He has the ball a lot, he’s the driver of an offense, but he doesn’t dominate every single possession. Throughout his career he has constantly flexed off-ball utilizing actions like cuts, post-ups, and attacked off of spot-ups as he gives his standard costar guard an opportunity to take up some possessions as well. He’s always achieved some balance. Throughout much of his career, people begged him to not be this way and just do *everything* all the time

Heliocentric is peak Houston Harden. *Every* possession of the Rockets offense was directly dictated by something he did with the ball. There essentially was no alternative some of those years. There was no off-possession. No off-ball actions, nothing. He was responsible for basically every offensive outcome 

Players like SGA, Giannis, Embiid, etc are also pretty clearly ball dominant. I don’t think you’d call them heliocentric, would you? || If the young star with the longer timeline were an Anthony Edwards type instead, you'd still give the ball to LeBron because of the skill set and how it maximizes both players. 

The other aspect of this framing that feels off to me is that it's even a role the two players are fighting for. LeBron's been itching to play off ball forever. The Lakers front office traded perfect heliocentric complement Danny Green for Dennis Schroeder. Then they traded more 3 and D role players for Russell Westbrook. And in between those seasons and now, LeBron put very public pressure on the Lakers to trade for Kyrie Irving. Those aren't the moves you push for if you want to have the ball in your hands all the time. || Boston and Golden State. That’s it. OKC you sell out on SGA and tell Lu Dort to beat you from 3. He is very hot and cold, and he sort of needs to be on the floor, because Dort is the single best Luka defender in the League. || This is very important. If they want to counter this kind of defense, they have to put offensive minded players who likes to shoot but those players are mostly not good defensively. LebronAustinLuka will kill you offensively. Even if they get hot, the Lakers can put Gabe, DFS and Vando to slow them down. However, not sure if this works during the playoffs. But still a team with Luka as first option and Lebron as 2nd option with Austin as 3rd will be too much for a lot of teams. I hope everyone stays healthy because this could be very fun playoffs with the variety of how teams are constructed. || Yeah it’s not just that you can’t key into anyone but also that they have two guards that will pull for 3 if you don’t fight over screens. Lakers have no one that can fight over screens besides sort of reaves and 0 offense Gabe Vincent. They have to switch everything and then you have Darius garland or Donovan Mitchell repeatedly isoing Luka, which is even worse than Jayson Tatum and Jaylen brown doing so like last year.

Lakers will continue to play good, smart, active team defense in the playoffs but their weakness in iso defense (Luka and AR are both solid team defenders but bad on an island) can be exposed most readily by the Cavs. || Thank you!! Hope you enjoy the rest of the pieces on there || just another piece of evidence that almost directly undermines the complaints about too many 3s. 3s are being generated in different ways by every team. takes more than a first glance to understand players aren’t just jacking up shots for no reason other than 3>2 || Yeah I think fans (myself included) don't realize how much energy it takes to be the focal point of the offense, especially at age 40. Him not handling the ball every possession has allowed him to spend that energy on all the other aspects of his game. || Correct! Tobias is a 5.0 player. || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || is 2018 lebron heliocentric? || I think you could throw the Cavs in there, but maybe not since they also have other ways to score. Being the most efficient team in the NBA means making the best play, which sometimes is at the rim. || good thing they are in the East! Its interesting tho because I think the Cavs will have to figure out how they can impact Luka and Lebron as defenders with no one on their team possessing the size enough to really affect their playstyle. So while the Cavs could exploit, I feel like the Lakers are a bad matchup for them as well because their best players are guards and centers whereas the Lakers are both 6 foot 7-9 do it all hybrid players w incredible court vision || I disagree. What would happen is that the Lakers would switch and sell out hard to the three point line on isos. Any blow by would then run into a packed paint leaving Mobley and Allen open at the 3 point line or the dunkers spot. Okoro would also be left open. 

Also offensively the Lakers are the worst Cavs matchup possible. Luka and LeBron absolutely love going matchup hunting, and both would abuse Garland and Mitchell, who are just not big enough to guard them. || That’s why he kept asking for “playmakers”, which tbf every star needs around them, but it’s especially noticeable with stars that are AARP eligible.

The Lakers just kept going for “playmakers” with no jumpers. || Lest we forget to tortoise and the haire. Tobias out here playing 5d connect four || Against the Cavs, I am interested to see what the Lakers do, but my instinct is that they pack the paint and tell Mobley to beat them from 3, in a similar way to what they did for Aaron Gordon. || I would think Mobley wade and hunter would be decently good matchups on d.  All have a combo of size/length/strength to hold their ground || That's a good point about the cavs defense, I'm wondering if a series would end up looking like the 90s with all the post ups--except it's two 6'8 guards posting up on 6'3 guys and looking to create instead of 7 footers duking it out.

I do think you're kind of describing the issue with the lakers weaknesses, though. When you go to make up for them what ends up happening is you create other weaknesses, and the Cavs have the shooters to punish. || If they pack the paint, it won’t be Mobley beating them from three. || Lmao u can’t put Garland AND MItchell on the same court against Luka and LeBron they will get hunted relentlessly || Lol Mobley is WAY too slight for Lebron and not a perimeter defender…hunter and dean wade man come on lol. They are alright players overall but lets be real || I’m not sure I buy the Cavs shooting in the playoffs though. Their closing lineups will all have Mobley in, if not Allen as well. The Lakers will just sag off them the same way they do to everyone else. I’m genuinely very concerned about the Cavs in the playoffs. They are fantastic but they have so many exploitable weaknesses. || What the Lakers have played is a paint focused defence where they then close out hard on good shooters - so whoever the Cavs have 1-3, and leave bad or just low volume shooters open, so Mobley and Okoro would probably be left wide open. || Thanks for the insight. I guess we’ll see. His 3 is coming along, but it’s his first year really exploring it. He shot some last year, but has a lot more this year.  All part of the progression to superstar. || Okoro probably wouldn’t see the court much if we met in the finals, and Mobley plays the 5 a lot of the time with 4 shooters since we stagnant him and JA’s minutes.

LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-02-27,nbadiscussion,1izk0tj,Maybe We Should Rethink Unfair and Lazy NBA Narratives,"I do not post often on Reddit but I just had to get this off my chest. Please share your thoughts even if it's about a single sentence that I have written. Apologies if this post is an incoherent mess and a long rambly mess. I'm just trying to get my ideas out there. To start off, I do not claim to be objective and I have my own preconceived notions, biases, and prejudices. I could be mistaken in various of my points here and I am open to having a discussion about any of them. Also, I note lots of examples in this post so forgive me if these examples are not 100% exhaustive.

Peruse r/nba or r/nbadiscussion and you will see a variety of narratives, especially about superstar or HOF-bound players or even solid role players:

""LeBron James cannot win without a superstar teammate""

""Kevin Durant cannot win without Steph Curry""

""Russel Westbrook will never win a championship""

""It is impossible for Joel Embiid to get out of the second round""

""X player never won anything""

""Scottie Pippen can't lead a team""

""Allen Iverson single-handedly dragged the 76ers in 2001 to the finals""

""Dirk Nowitzki carried the 2011 Mavericks""

""James Harden cannot win as the #1 option"".

""X player jumps ship and moves teams when it gets tough""

""Chris Paul can't win a ring""

""Jimmy Butler has never won anything""

""The 50s and 60s players played against plumbers and milkmen""

""Jordan went 1-9 in playoff series without Scottie Pippen""

""Kevin Garnett could only win once he teamed up with other all-stars""

""X player is inefficient/is a ball hog/is a stat padder""

""Rudy Gobert is a bagless big and is overrated""

""X player got swept/convincingly beat in a playoff series, therefore Y""

""X player is greater than Y player because he stayed loyal to Z franchise""

""X player missed the playoffs in his prime, therefore Y""

""X player saved Y player's legacy""

""X player is no better than a scrub role player""

and many, many others...

Admittedly, I too, found some of these narratives convincing. You likely have reservations about one or more of these narratives. It is irrelevant whether or not these narratives are true. Players are devalued and valued based on things they largely have no control over. Regardless of whether you believe these narratives or not, they are ubiquitous in NBA discussions. All of these narratives are dependent on these outcomes decided by near inches or close games: Ron Artest's 2010 Game 7 Finals 3pt shot, Kyrie Irving's Game 7 Finals 2016 3pt shot, Kevin Durant's game-tying shot in Game 7 2021 ECSF, JR Smith's blunder in Game 1 of the 2018 Finals, Kawhi's Game 7 buzzer-beater in the 2019 ECSF, Jason Kidd's infamous momentum killing timeout in last year's 2024 Finals in Game 3, Game 6 Klay in the 2016 WCF, John Paxson's clutch shot in the 1993 Finals, Steve Kerr's clutch shot in the 1997 NBA Finals, 2002 WCF Game 6 Kings vs Lakers, Ray Allen's clutch shot in Game 7 2013, Game 5 1994 Bulls vs Knicks ECSF (Hue Hollins) call away. These are all moments that could have gone either way and should not define a player's legacy (the most overused word in NBA dialect nowadays) or their impact on winning basketball games.

All of these narratives are also dependent on injuries: Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving injuries in 2015, Draymond Green's suspension in 2016, Kevin Durant missing the 2015 playoffs and the entire 2020 season, Westbrook missing the 2013 playoffs after his meniscus tear, Steph Curry missing most of the 2020 season, Chris Paul getting hurt in the 2018 WCF, Kawhi's injury in the 2017 WCF, Klay Thompson tearing his ACL and Achilles, LeBron tearing in groin in 2019 and missing the playoffs, Kevin Garnett getting hurt in 2009, and I could keep going but I won't for brevity.

Some of these narratives depend on the situations of players drafted to not-ideal situations or bad front offices: LeBron was drafted to a mediocre Cleveland team in 2003, Kevin Garnett's time with Minnesota was plagued with misfortunes (like the Joe Smith situation, among others), OKC let go of James Harden and Demarcus Cousins was drafted to the Kings.

I find something wrong with denigrating or valuing players based on injuries they cannot control or outcomes that could have gone either way. Instead, players should be valued based on their individual performances and their impact on winning in a large enough sample size. I don't know what the sample size is so you can decide that. Maybe we need 40 playoff games to determine how well a player performs in the postseason. If so, then we should need around that same amount of regular season games to see how good a player is in general. I find it logical to value postseason performance more than regular season performance and most of us already do this.

You can have players who are individually excellent and impact winning tremendously (Jokic), players who are individually excellent but don't impact winning (Kevin Love in Minnesota), and players who are not individually excellent but impact winning (Draymond Green). Yet, some people value Draymond Green over Kevin Love or vice versa. That is an interesting conversation to have. It's not interesting to simply say ""Draymond has more rings than Kevin Love, therefore he is a better player"" because their circumstances are so different. I once thought like this as well, but I think it is a lazy attempt for our brains to make conclusions on highly variable situations and circumstances between players with completely different teammates, coaches, front office, the era they played in, etc.

As most of us know, individual players' stats do not tell the whole story and are not consistent indicators. Looking at box score numbers to determine a player's impact does not reveal that player's true impact. You could look at Box Plus-Minus, Win Shares, DBPM, Net Rating, PER, DARKO, or whatever other metrics to find the most impactful basketball players. A player's impact should be the only thing that matters when evaluating a player's greatness. We know Jayson Tatum impacts winning, but that does not stop someone from saying ""Oh, but he didn't win Finals MVP"". I think we need to stop this infantile level of discussion. I am guilty of engaging in this type of discussion myself. Whether we should value individual performances over impact on winning depends on the situation and that is a conversation we can have.

When I use ""we"", I am referring to some NBA fans, not all. Intangibles like leadership, mental toughness, and poise under tight situations, play a role in player evaluation, but it is unfair when the NBA community says ""X player is not a leader"" or ""X player is not clutch"" or ""X is soft"" when we are not in the locker room with that player and we cannot possibly have an inkling of knowledge on these intangibles. We use a few clips or quotes to make these conclusions about players without knowing the full story and circumstances behind a player. We use the stats of said player in the clutch as a way to be objective, we say, yet each clutch situation is highly different with varying circumstances. Instead of how players perform in the clutch under relatively similar conditions (we say it's too much work to do this), we just throw out the clutch stats of one player against another to make our conclusion. I must admit I have done this myself when debating with others on this particular topic. These types of conclusions are frankly lazy and we should do better as the NBA community.

We devalue LeBron James for his series against the Mavericks in 2011 and attribute none of that loss to the Mavericks' game planning, we blame Steph Curry for ""choking"" in 2016 and narratives persisted for years that he was not clutch even though that 2016 Warriors team was minutes away from winning the title, we say Jordan was 1-9 in the playoffs without Scottie Pippen as ""proof"" that Jordan is not as great as we say he is, we say that Kobe's legacy was ""saved"" thanks to Ron Artest's shot in Game 7 2010 Finals, we say that Westbrook is a selfish stat padder who will never win a title, among other narratives that try to make simple conclusions for outcomes. As a specific example, we forget that Iverson's 2001 76ers could have faced Vince Carter's Raptors in the ECF instead of the Bucks if Vice Carter hadn't missed that game-winning shot in Game 7 against the Bucks in the semi-finals. We don't know the outcome of a 2001 76ers vs Raptors ECF, but people would not be idolizing Iverson for ""dragging"" that 76ers team to the finals. We see Vince Carter as one of those very good players, HOF worthy, but not ""one of the greats"", when it's very possible he could have led his team to the finals in 2001 which would have given him extra ""legacy"" points. This is just one example out of many of how we elevate and denigrate players based on non-deterministic outcomes determined by mere inches.

The biggest problem is that NBA discussion is based wholly on simplistic narratives instead of actual basketball, which I am aware has already been talked about ad nauseum.  Whether a team wins a championship depends on so many factors including team chemistry, front office decisions, games decided in the last few seconds/minutes, playcalling, competent coaching, etc.

I could be wrong here, but I do not find it convincing that superstar players are the main reason for their team's success. They are the most consistent contributors to a team, but an individual player is almost never responsible for more than 50% of the team's offensive production. We say that Nikola Jokic is carrying the Nuggets this year. As of today's date 02/27/25, Nikola Jokic is averaging 29.2 ppg, 12.6 rpg, 10.4 apg (source: https://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/\_/name/den/denver-nuggets). He's contributing to 29.2 + (10.4 \* 2 < x < 10.4 \* 3) points, somewhere along the lines of 50 ppg for the Nuggets. Yet, the Nuggets score 121.3 ppg. The overall team collectively is contributing more than Nikola Jokic individually even though it may not seem that way when watching the games. The Nuggets have struggled this year, but it's not because of Jokic. This is an oversimplification of this point just for clarity. We expect a superstar's team to win when they have a 30-point triple-double or when they drop 50 points. We expect superstars to ""carry"" their teams to titles when basketball is a team sport. The idea of a ""#1 option"" or ""#2 option"" is another way for us to categorize players in a simple way. Fans, including myself, are obsessed with individual heroics. We blame superstar players when their teams lose. We call these players ""chokers"" when they perform poorly in playoff games. We say these players are not clutch or they are not ""killers"" like Kobe or MJ. If given a large enough sample size of poor performances in playoff games, then it is fair to conclude a player cannot perform consistently well in playoff games where teams are game planning against them (James Harden comes to mind, perceived as a choker, whether or not this is true is irrelevant). Yet, how many times have we seen a player have historic performances, yet still lose? Examples include:

Jordan's Bulls vs Celtics 1986 averaging 43.7/6.3/5.7 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1986-nba-eastern-conference-first-round-bulls-vs-celtics.html),

LeBron's Cavs vs Warriors 2018 averaging 34/8.5/10 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2018-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html),

Curry's Warriors vs Raptors 2019 averaging 30.5/5.2/6 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-finals-warriors-vs-raptors.html),

Durant's Thunder vs Heat Finals averaging 30.6/6/2.2 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2012-nba-finals-heat-vs-thunder.html)

We fail to realize that individual heroics do not always transcend the team's collective performance and they often do not. We shouldn't penalize players for that.

This is why player rankings, GOAT debates, and the aforementioned narratives lead to unfair discussions of certain players. If you've been watching the NBA long enough, you'll find these conversations stale and dull, for good reason. Looking at the most impactful players, basketball strategy, game planning, players and their individual performances is a much more fruitful conversation than only comparing the most accomplished. It's easy to compare the individual accolades between players. It's harder to compare their impact only.

We elevate players for winning MVPs, DPOYs, championships, All-NBA teams, and All-Defense teams when these are highly dependent on the talent in the rest of the league. It is unfair to elevate one player who has an MVP over another player who does not solely based on that accolade. When I compare two players, I ask myself this question: If I swap the individual accolades of the players I am comparing, does that change my perspective of them? Of course, the exception is players who would never win certain accolades in any era (Tony Allen likely never wins an MVP in any era and Isaiah Thomas never wins a defensive accolade in any era for being 5'9). If I swap the accolades of LeBron James and Michael Jordan, does that change your perspective of each player? If I change the circumstances (where they were drafted, front office decisions, teammates they have, etc.) of one player with another, does that have any effect on the careers of said players? The answer to both questions must be yes and it likely is for many readers. That is fundamentally a problem with how we evaluate players. We cannot make conclusions about an individual player's greatness based on their accolades or championships because these are situational and circumstantial. Many players who have won MVP would never have won MVP while playing in the 1990s while Michael Jordan was playing. That's not to undermine their incredible accomplishments, but context is needed especially when comparing and evaluating players.

I think that the only fair way to determine the value of a player is the impact they have on winning basketball games and their individual performances. Winning crucial playoff games and titles is dependent on much more than a superstar player's performance. I do not need to see Luka win a title to know he can be the biggest contributor to a championship team. He's transcendent enough to where I do not need to see him to do that to believe it. I don't need to see Jayson Tatum win an MVP to know he's an incredible basketball player. James Harden's Rockets were 27 missed threes away from advancing to the finals in 2018 yet according to NBA Twitter, he could never win as ""#1 option"" on a team. Yet, individual talent transcends being in varying situations. This is why superstar players who are healthy and in their primes consistently produce and don't average 30 ppg one year and 16 ppg the next despite being surrounded by different teammates, opponents, and coaches. Even being able to perform consistently among those wildly different conditions is praiseworthy (can we stop saying glazing whenever we praise someone?) to me. As such, the only fair criterion for players is their individual performances and how those performances elevate (or don't elevate) their teams. We've seen players be great individually but not consistently elevate their teams.

Because the playoffs have fewer games than the regular season, it is incredibly unfair to judge players solely based on that. Every single player has had bad games in the regular season, yet they cannot have bad performances in the postseason? The outcome of a basketball game is much more complex and has more variables than a superstar player's individual performance.

All that to say we should definitely value players who lead teams titles, especially more so when a player dominates the competition. All of these accomplishments contribute to the GREATNESS of a player, but not whether they are a better player than another player by themselves. Intangibles also matter a ton, but it is tough to evaluate them specifically. I find that when people talk about a player's intangibles, it's all about gut feeling. Please let me know if there is a way to evaluate a player's intangibles fairly. I personally must refrain from talking about intangibles because evaluating a player's intangibles is subject to our preconceived notions, biases, and prejudices, all of which I have. We're not in the locker room with a player, we're not aware of what they say or do in the huddle during a timeout, we don't know what the player says to motivate their teammates before a big playoff game, and we as NBA fans often do not have the knowledge to make conclusions on a player's intangibles. Of course, intangibles matter, but most NBA fans, including myself, do not have the information to evaluate them (even though we think we do). There is a reason many people question the validity of Bill Russel's 11 championships. It's because competition is a factor. There were only 8 teams and 9 Hall of Famers were on that 1960s Celtics team. Despite that, Bill Russel is (and should be) an all-time great but we often say Jordan was better for a multitude of reasons. The only thing that should matter is whether a player performs well and whether their performance elevates their team.

I just wish we were in a world where NBA fans could discuss basketball in its purest form instead of endless, unfounded narratives and dull debates about ""Who's the GOAT?"", ""Can X player be the #1 option on a championship team?"", ""Does X player have that dog or killer instinct in him?"", ""I need X player to drop a 40-point triple-double to win this game"", ""X player cannot carry a team"", ""X player will never win a ring because Y"", ""X player flat-out choked"", etc. Why can't we talk about a team's game plan against a superstar player to slow them down, why can't we talk about or argue how a player's individual greatness either elevates or denigrates their team's overall performance? Why can't we talk about role players without demolishing them for not being the biggest contributors on their teams? Why can't the NBA talk about actual basketball strategy? Talking heads like Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith who know very little about actual basketball strategy behind it have perpetuated these narratives for decades and it has seeped into NBA fan discourse.

TL;DR: I believe that when comparing and evaluating NBA players, we should only look at their individual performances, impact on winning, intangibles, and pure basketball strategy (game planning, defensive schemes, offensive schemes). Not winning titles or accolades only. A particular individual winning an individual accolade (MVP, Finals MVP, All-NBA, All-Defensive, All-Star) does not by itself make one player better than another. This is because these awards are based completely on the competition and the era you play in. A player winning a championship does not by itself make one player better than another. Most of us who have followed the NBA for a while already know this. This is because there are incredibly varying circumstances, injuries, and outcomes that affect winning titles or accolades.

If I could summarize my argument in one sentence, it would be this: Narratives that do not relate to individual performances, impact on winning (there is a difference between the impact on winning and winning), intangibles (I only trust evaluations of this from players, coaches, front office members, or other insiders of an NBA org), or basketball strategy are lazy and unfair attempts to evaluate players.

Again, I could be mistaken on all of this so please let me know what you think. I am open to being corrected about anything here.

  
EDIT: Thanks to DrizzyDayZD. I made a mistake when talking about the series between the Bucks and the Raptors. The Raptors faced off against 76ers in the ECSF in 2001, not the Bucks. My point was to illustrate how people's admiration of Iverson leading his team to the Finals would not have happened if Vince Carter hits that game winning shot in Game 7.",176,114,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1izk0tj/maybe_we_should_rethink_unfair_and_lazy_nba/,2025-02-27 11:37:24,"You have hit on just about every reason why I stopped writing about the NBA.

I don’t actually have a problem with most narratives. Can X player be the number one option on a championship team?

I hope you will take this constructive criticism as it is meant: encouragement to keep writing and keep honing your craft.

You meander a bit.

You'll get a lot more engagement by narrowing down your focus. Instead of listing 50+ examples, pick 2-3 and make your point.

You could have turned this into a whole series -- tell me why ""Chris Paul Can't Win"" is lazy; tell me why ""Draymond > Kevin Love"" is lazy.

Thanks for elevating the fan discourse. || Still reading, but wow, you have obviously put a lot of time and thought into this post! || Yeah but its incredibly difficult to discern who is better than who and who makes a bigger impact to winning by just watching games, thats why things like stats, accolades and performances are used. But all of these things are inherently tied to the team and environment that player plays in which can highligh certain strengths of weaknesses. 

>intangibles (I only trust evaluations of this from players, coaches, front office members, or other insiders of an NBA org

This part is specifically tough. For example, the Mavericks or Wolves just trade a guy like KAT and Luka, which by intent means they do not believe that those players can help them win, but is that a fair assesment? Its hard to predict the future regarding picks and trades. || This is not a very good post for a variety of reasons, but I'll point out just a few:

> Looking at box score numbers to determine a player's impact does not reveal that player's true impact. You could look at Box Plus-Minus, Win Shares, DBPM, Net Rating, PER, DARKO, or whatever other metrics to find the most impactful basketball players.

As the name suggests, BPM is based entirely on box-score numbers.

> I do not find it convincing that superstar players are the main reason for their team's success. They are the most consistent contributors to a team, but an individual player is almost never responsible for more than 50% of the team's offensive production. We say that Nikola Jokic is carrying the Nuggets this year. As of today's date 02/27/25, Nikola Jokic is averaging 29.2 ppg, 12.6 rpg, 10.4 apg (source: https://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/\_/name/den/denver-nuggets). He's contributing to 29.2 + (10.4 * 2 < x < 10.4 * 3) points, somewhere along the lines of 50 ppg for the Nuggets. Yet, the Nuggets score 121.3 ppg. The overall team collectively is contributing more than Nikola Jokic individually even though it may not seem that way when watching the games. 

This is straightforwardly wrong according to the same advanced stats that you advocate for above. [Nikola Jokic has contributed 7.6 of Denver's 10.9 VORP this year](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DEN/2025.html). A team with Jokic and 11 veteran-minimum players would almost certainly be better than the Nuggets minus Jokic. 

This very simple point was understood decades ago in baseball (and broadly shared in ""Moneyball""); a team consisting entirely of replacement-level players (e.g. solid triple-A players) wins about 50/162 games in baseball, not zero games. || [removed] || If you've never heard of Ben Taylor at Thinking Basketball I HIGHLY suggest you check him out. In my opinion, THE best source for actual analysis of the game of basketball beyond awards, narratives, etc. His website, YouTube channel and book are all valuable resources for understanding the inner workings of the game, how talented and contributive to winning players actually are, how context of the modern game informs our understanding of past trends, and much more beyond just what Shaq, Stephen A. and whoever else decide is the most lucrative topic for them to bring up that day. || You can’t just ignore circumstances and situational aspects though. That is all we have to base performance  off. Where someone’s drafted is a huge factor. Basketball strategy, game planning, and individual performances are all situational. Everything is situational who your teammates are, how healthy they are, do you have a good coach, front office have you set up for success or tanking. Does Tatum have the same impact on winning if he got drafted to the wizards instead of the Celtics. Does Jokic put up the same performances if Luka is on his team. If LeBron stayed in Cleveland he may not have any championships but who knows the individual performances he could have put up vs playing with Wade and Bosh. || Without looking at each example in detail I would say that broadly speaking, you are correct. Too much NBA conversation is driven by narratives. Player won = he must have all of the qualities we think are good. Player lost = it’s his fault and he lacks something. Some great players have lost early and lesser players have rings at home. 
Talking heads don’t want to talk bball so they have to talk in narratives. And sadly they aren’t even good at that anymore. Now they just talk in criticism. || Humans on a large scale only talk in absolutes. That's where all these stupid narratives come from because they're from stupid people || People have been saying all these things for decades and decades. It hasn’t changed and arguably has gotten worse. On the bright side you have more access to independent analysis on youtube or stats blogs than ever before. Just tune it out and find smaller analysts you like, mainstream won’t improve || The reason why so much NBA media is tilted to these simplistic, ridiculous narratives and beefs is because the average American lacks the critical thinking skills and understanding of nuance to digest anything beyond the toddler level garbage we're fed. || Fantastic write-up! For those who prefer a quick summary, I used AI to condense it:

NBA player evaluations often rely on oversimplified narratives, championships, and awards, overlooking basketball's team-oriented nature. Players should be assessed based on their individual performance, impact on winning, and strategic contributions, rather than just titles, clutch moments, or vague intangibles like ""killer instinct."" Factors like injuries, luck, and team dynamics are often beyond a player's control, so discussions should focus on deeper basketball analysis instead of reductive debates. 

Highly recommend reading the full post! || I love basketball. For me it’s the best sports out there. Team sport where the individual star can shine the brightest. In nba I get to watch basketball at the highest level possible with the best players in the world. So I don’t care about the discourse that much. I take it more in jest, kind of like soap opera for men 😂 || Its too late, this how all internet is now…from more innocent conversations about basketball to more serious ones about politics. We’re stuck in a cesspool of misinformation, un nuanced takes, and a willingness to be rude for no reason || Shoot, a lot of those are true tbh. But they’re also all negative . 

So focusing on the bad is moreso the problem imo. || [removed] || [removed] || 100% agree with the titles vs. # of teams in the league. It’s 4x harder to win a championship when there are 32 teams in the league vs. 8 teams. Hence, IMO Bill Russell’s 11 rings should be valued at 3 compared to someone like LeBron or Steph in the modern era. || I don’t think it’s unique to the NBA. This is part of the world we live in where entertainment companies of all sorts are constantly competing for our attention. People naturally have a short attention span when surrounded by novelties. And some of the headlines which have come out of sports in the past five or ten years are downright sensational. 



Along with that, there has always been a tendency among sports fans to have endless conversations about hypothetical matchups or career comparisons or talent levels. Combine that with our overexposure to bombastic media and we get these exaggerated takes on sports reddits. 



The same thing is happening in everyday speech. We all know how often people say “literally” these days. I don’t know if it’s because people are subconsciously becoming desensitized to descriptive language, but hyperbole seems to be on the rise. “X must be protected at all costs” “I’m literally dead” “James Harden is literally hitler”



Obviously these are meme phrases, but this kind of language exists all over the place, not just in sports. You are definitely picking up on this phenomenon where powerful language is more popular than rational discussion. Is this new to our digital age? Have people always had over-the-top arguments with each other? It’s probably a little of both. Whatever it is it’s everywhere and it certainly hasn’t spared the NBA. || Its simple... I actually think its all about a paycheck - money. Past players are so jealous of money of todays players is making.  That’s why they diss current players so much because retired players didnt make a lot. || [removed] || [removed] || [removed] || This is kind of tangential to your point, but I think the way the Celtics fleeced the Nets in 2013 in the Pierce & KG trade belongs right up there with the rest of your examples. People talk about the trade when they're ranking GMs, what was the worst trade ever, blah blah blah, and it's absolutely interesting in those conversations! But to your point, the trade is not ""pure basketball,"" yet it had (and still has) an enormous impact on the accolades that people like to use to evaluate players. 

The Celtics got to fast forward through rebuilding. Tatum and Brown joined a winning franchise, and got meaningful playoff experience from year 1. I'm a Celtics fan and I think Tatum is incredible, but when people bring up how high his playoff points are for his age, it's impossible to ignore that he was a #3 pick (and would have gone #1) who joined a team that won 53 games and made the ECF the year before he was drafted! That's not a knock against him, it's just a reminder that players exist in a broader context that has nothing to do with their basketball skills.

Anyway, all that is to say rings and stats and wins and losses all have a lot more going into them than what happens on the court, and any narrative which ignores that is at best misleading. || [removed] || I hear u, man. 

The problem is, imo, there is no sport where the players are judged, by media fans and former players, quite like basketball. 

The whole discussion of the sport is based on hate, and the current players understand this. So they look out for themselves, and then everyone judges them negatively for it || Thank you. It is absurd how so much of NBA discussion is narrative-driven instead of pure basketball. || I always love the Spurs as examples -- there was a long drought between their last two Finals appearances and the previous ones, and they just kept grinding it out. || It's always been about narratives since the 1980s. Especially in the 1990s with Jordan it was always about bloviated storylines not actual basketball. || Isn’t half the problem that the game has lost a lot of its strategy, so it’s just a three point shooting contest. It’s hard to actually break down the basketball in new ways, so we just talk about things like “did player x save player ys legacy” || That's definitely part of it. I myself don't know every single that's going on the court when I watch a game but I try to learn more and understand what's happening. Part of it is that people don't want to be educated when they watch a basketball game, they want to be entertained. Nothing wrong with that, but it's just a different perspective than someone who wants to learn more.

When it comes to stuff like ""number one"" option, I personally don't like the term because it individualizes a team sport into a neatly defined hierachy of players of ""#1 options"", ""#2 options"", ""#3 options"" that are not as important in different eras. In 2000, the third option on the Lakers was Derek Fisher. Could he be the third option today? Probably not. Who was the ""#3 option"" for the 2004 Pistons? Ben Wallace who was offensively challenged? Just say best player or second best player and be done with it. I see why people use it. Looking at their performances and playoffs runs under a big enough sample size to evaluate them can actually lead to some decent discussions. Just my honest thoughts on the matter. || Your first point is very important. The game has become so complex that most of the fans (myself included) dont really know what is happening on the court. When someone says there are too many 3s being taken, they dont really care about the X's and O's that lead to the 3. They just care about how the possession is ending. And if half of them end in a 3 point attempt, I can understand why that would be boring to watch. If we had people in the media actually teaching the game and talking about what is happening rather than having Shaq and Chuck throw out their shit takes, it would be lead to much better discourse || There is a decades long take on NBA games, it’s only relevant to watch the last minutes of the game. 

Then add in with a TOTAL of 1230 games during the regular season. A single game doesn’t matter at all. So why waste time watching it especially when times are not friendly to the average viewer outside of PST? Why tune into a west coast game on a Wednesday night at 11pm when I need to take care of a family and wake up for work the next game?

Ain’t nobody got time for the NBA unless you’re a young person with time. That is why the NBA discourse will always suck because no one can sustainably watch games. 


The average NFL fan doesn’t know what the nuances and complexities of coverages and formations. Their discourse and narratives isn’t nearly as bad as the NBA || I don't really think that explanation tracks. Basketball is a much easier sport to understand than football, for example, but NFL discourse isn't nearly as bad (it's not good, but still). || Thank you very much for the feedback. The reason I decided to give many examples is I didn't want people to think I was defending a certain player or fighting back against a narrative from my favorite team or player. I may write more posts that are more specific for a narrative against a player as you suggest. That is certainly a great idea. Since I know my post was long-winded, I included a one sentence summation of my argument at the very end of my post. Hope that clarifies my argument concisely. || [removed] || Thank you. I did put a lot of time and effort into it. I probably could have explained my point more concisely but I hope you got something out of it. || No doubt. Stats and performances can definitely be used, I just don't like accolades alone to say player A is better than player B. Every player is also in a completely different situation, some favorable and others unfavorable.

When it comes to your second point, that is an accurate counterexample. I agree with you, actually so I will reevaluate my stance. The Mavericks trading Luka only shows me the Mavericks don't believe in Luka (or if you believe the theory that they want to move the team to Las Vegas) and that the Wolves didn't believe in KAT. It is not a consensus decision and widely believed among that the intangibles of these players is poor. With KAT, there are some examples of players saying he's soft (like Jimmy Butler), but I don't quite know if this is widely believed around the league.

So to reiterate, I think that the intangibles of a player can be determined based on the consensus (players, front office, other insiders, etc.) from around the league because they have more knowledge than the average NBA fan to make those conclusions. || I trust the eye test more than stats. You can watch a game and a guy could be having a 50% shooting night but missed 5 extra shots because they got bumped or their hand was hit, late shot clock shot. Guys like Draymond don’t always show up in the stat sheet. Watching the game he could yell for a guy to do a specific coverage that causes a player to miss but the guy he yelled at got the defensive stat of making the guy miss, not him. He could show on a P&R and cause a shooter to pass to a worse shooter who misses. He impacts winning. That’s why a guy like Love, for all of his rebounds and shots in Minny couldn’t win. He was a lousy defender. Some guys are products of crappy GMs not giving them complementary teammates. Klay was great for Draymond because he had two targets who worked off all for scores. Now with Butler on the team he’s great for Steph. His putting teams in foul trouble means they can’t hop ride Steph as much on the dribble or risk sending him to the line. The big travesty is Kobe being drafted to LA with Shaq already established and an all star Eddie Jones in place. Then add a Del Harris who didn’t like playing rookies. He had to work 4yrs to get into the lineup. || Thanks for your feedback. I would also really appreciate if you can also comment on other areas in my post that are lacking. I mentioned BPM, but I was really trying to explain that a variety of stats, box score numbers notwithstanding, could be used to explain a player's impact. In other words, I should have really said ""ONLY Looking at box score numbers..."". I appreciate you bringing this up though.

Additionally, on your VORP point, I agree that Jokic with vet minimums would be better than the Nuggets minus Jokic. I won't argue with you there or about how valuable Jokic is. My only point is that Jokic's teammates are responsible for a larger part of the offense than he is. No matter how much he contributes, his teammates need to execute and make shots for them to win games. As an extreme and contrived example, Jokic and 4 players from the YMCA are not winning games. Jokic and 4 of the worst players in the league in the starting lineup won't win a title. That's not a knock on Jokic, that's simply the team-based nature of basketball and what makes it more interesting (in my view) than golf or tennis which are individual sports. That's not to say he can't raise the floor of a team tremendously.

Of course, Jokic contributes much more in other ways besides box score numbers. Even including screen assists of which he is third (source: https://www.nba.com/stats/players/hustle?sort=SCREEN\_ASSISTS&dir=1) at 4.6 which let's assume amounts to around 10-ish points (his teammates still need to score off the screen) a game plus the 50 ppg rough estimate from his raw box score numbers, that is still around half of the Nuggets offense. You can say he indirectly improves the team through secondary assists or his gravity as an offensive player or through any other metric. My only point is that the other Nuggets players on the roster collectively contribute at least more than half to the Nuggets offense than Jokic does. Jokic can spoonfeed his teammates but they still need to make shots. Please correct me if I'm wrong on this. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || Yes. I love his channel. I love that type of content. I don't expect NBA media to be that high quality, but it's incredibly insightful to watch actual basketball content and film. Another channel I watch is BBALLBREAKDOWN which is excellent as well for breaking down film. It was unbeknownst to me that he he had written a book. I will definitely consider reading that. The most perplexing is that former players, especially elite players like Shaq are closer to the camp of the Stephen A. Smiths of the world than the Ben Taylors of the world. || Bingo. Exactly the crux of my argument. || Right. It's the only way that we as highly flawed human beings can make simple conclusions on very nuanced and variable situations. What easier way than to simply state who won rings and who didn't? Notice how there are so many players who ""couldn't win"" until they actually did. I mention Michael Jordan before 1991 and Giannis before 2021 in the post as examples. All of this nonsense from those ""talking heads"" really just distracts from actual basketball analysis, film analysis, game planning, play calling, etc. The reality is that narratives get more clicks than a video explaining how a zone defense works and when to use it. || No, I think that's unfair. I don't think people are dumb. I just think they're misinformed, they just want to be entertained or they want to not think about basketball as a strategy game, or they are just unaware that basketball discourse exists outside of barbershop style talk. || Oh yeah, these problems are not new. The mainstream has to appeal to the casual fan somehow and explaining how to ICE a pick and roll is not one of those things. Yep, you're right and that's why I am glad to be living in the Internet era. Resources of actual good content exist, we just have to tune out all of the mainstream noise. || Yeah. Just look at the type of people that get elected in American politics in general.  Neither the smartest or the nicest people ever get elected. || Thank you for this comment. Glad you enjoyed reading it. I also have a TL;DR at the end for a concise description of my argument but this description is pretty accurate too. || [removed] || I can't blame you for thinking that. I just think injuries are a huge part of why he hasn't won a championship without Curry. In 2013, Westbrook gets hurt and their playoff run ends. In 2014, Serge Ibaka gets hurt against the Spurs in the WCF. In 2015, KD is gets hurt and OKC misses the playoffs. In 2019, he tears his Achilles. Out for all of 2020. In 2021, James Harden and Kyrie Irving gets hurt. Those are only for injuries. If Curry gets hurt for two of his greatest seasons and has injured key teammates for others, that affects his success and therefore how we view him. Not to say Curry isn't great, but my only point is that winning is circumstantial and is not the end all be all. || Our sub is for in-depth discussion. Low-effort comments or stating opinions as facts are not permitted. Please support your opinions with well-reasoned arguments, including stats and facts as applicable. || Doh, you're right. I just recently watched clips of Game 7 of that series yet for some reason while I was writing the post, I thought the Raptors faced the Bucks. I will make that correction in my post. Thanks. || Please keep your comments civil. This is a subreddit for thoughtful discussion and debate, not aggressive and argumentative content. || You're completely right. I have spent too much time listening to ESPN and reading Reddit posts, haha. Do you have any specific suggestions on who to listen to or what books to read? || Yes. The reality is that most people accept them because it takes too much time to meticulously craft an accurate narrative of a player so they just accept the mainstream opinion of said player. Should I take the time to really evaluate Kevin Durant or just accept that he is a ""bus rider"" because Charles Barkley said so? Most people will choose the latter, especially if the person saying it is a HOFer. Frankly, this lack of critical thinking for opinions could be said for any superficial opinion that someone has. || Yep. Tatum has already made several impressive deep playoff runs in his career but just look at the current supporting cast for the Celtics. I have a sneaky suspicious that if Tatum was drafted #2 to the Lakers in 2017, his team would not have gone to conference finals like he did his rookie season and probably would have missed the playoffs for several seasons and missed that playoff experience he ended up getting. Three of those drafted picks (source: https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2023/07/21/celtics-nets-trade-2013-kevin-garnett-paul-pierce/) the Celtics got from that Nets trade led to Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and the pick used to trade for Kyrie Irving (which didn't work out, but still). Not bad for a geriatic Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. We cannot just ignore the talent around a player when evaluating them and I can't understand why people just overlook circumstances. Looking at Tatum alone, he would have been a superstar anywhere, but it might have taken more time in a different place and he might not have a title. || I'm not as in tune with other sports as I am with basketball, but it's not so much the criticism as it is about BS that has nothing to do with basketball. Players know that criticism comes with the territory but the criticism rarely about what specifically they're doing wrong. Players will get criticized on their performance or their intangibles. Rarely will they be constructively criticized on why they missed a defensive assignment or why they should have ran back in transition instead of jogged, etc. It's easy to criticize a player by looking at the box score and saying ""man's only dropped 10 points, what a scrub"" instead of actually understanding how they were limited to 10 points in the game and how they could have been more productive in the game. || > there is no sport where the players are judged, by media fans and former players, quite like basketball

I mean damn, men’s tennis just got done with the Big 3 era, the closest thing we have to saying “this was the objective peak of our sport’s history,” and yet there’s more positivity toward the next generation of players in men’s tennis than in the NBA. || The nostalgia riff, particularly from players from past eras, definitely drives a lot of the negativity. And it's hard to blame the current generation of players for reacting the way they do. I mean, the game evolves. There's not a sport anywhere that is played the same way today as it was 20-30 years ago, but hoopers appear to be the only ones really taking flak for it. || But there was still room for actual basketball discussion. With algorithms and engagement the only goals of modern media, there really isn't anymore. || The game really hasn't lost a lot of its strategy because every team has different ways of getting those shots. Are there some similarities in schemes? Sure. But it's far from homogenous. And team defend differently as well, as the challenges of having to cover nearly the entire 47x50 halfcourt area has to vary based on the skill sets of your personnel.

That would be an example of the lazy narratives OP discussed. || The discourse in the NFL isn’t close to being as bad for a few reasons IMO.

The media voices in the NFL aren’t engaging in this nonsense as much. Charles Barkley is loved by fans but he doesn’t say anything productive if you care about basketball strategy. I remember Stephen A saying that he’d take Ja Morant over Luka because of his defense as few years ago. 


The speed of an NFL game is different. The game isn’t as fast paced as basketball. Possessions don’t change every 14-16 seconds and the time between plays makes it easier for fans to digest what is happening on the field. It’s also more easier for commentators to relay information to fans. What Tony Romo was doing when he first got hired by CBS isn’t something that could be easily replicated in the NBA. 

When the Clippers played the Jazz in the 2021 playoffs, Terance Mann had a monster 39 points to win game 6. Poor perimeter defense, forces Gobert to help off Mann leaving him open for 3s. 
Way too many people thought that because Mann scored Gobert was responsible. Help defense principles aren’t that complicated yet I don’t remember people accurately explaining to fans what was happening on the court.

In the NFL, if the same defensive breakdown kept happening commentators would point out why who’s at fault and why it keeps happening.

NFL fans may not know formations but being a bit more educated on what happens in a game and not having former players and the media members spout BS all the time helps a ton IMO. || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || I have started writing things similar to this before, but I always stopped... I could never do it justice the way you have here. I am thoroughly impressed 

I think the truth is that a lot of fans haven't been watching super long, or haven't been watching closely for super long, or some combination of the above. That's why the take merchants are so popular - because they say a bunch of stuff that has the ring of truth (""James harden is not a winner!"") because it may appear true on paper, but that doesn't mean it's a rule to go by. If the Kawhi shot doesn't go in, but everything else that happened happens, people are lauding Embiid's career and low key making fun of Kawhi for basically never playing. So many things would be different. That's just one example where 700 things have to fall exactly in place for history to play out the way it did, but that's *every single championship.* Every single year.

Anyway, kudos. I think people are very quick to judge, myself included, and there's no downside to it. If James harden wins a ring I'll be pleasantly surprised, but if he doesn't, ""I was right all along!"" || You are obviously a huge fan. Your passion is refreshing. Thank you. || Both the eye test and stats are a good measure. Eye test can be too subjective. Those are great examples that you pointed out about Draymond. That's the kind of stuff I am talking about. THAT stuff is why stats don't tell the whole story which most of us know. Draymond is the kind of player the average fan laughs at for being hot headed and for averaging ""a triple single"" (which is still funny), but he is a huge reason for the Warriors' success.

Great point with Kobe, don't even think about an Eddie Jones. Imagine him having to back up a Clyde Drexler or some of the other great two-guards and barely getting minutes. Or imagine if he gets drafted to a team without another all star. We might have viewed him like we view Jimmy Butler (Kobe is much better than Butler, but just an example of two tough-minded players) today. || > My only point is that the other Nuggets players on the roster collectively contribute at least more than half to the Nuggets offense than Jokic does.

I don't agree that this point is true in any useful sense. A team of G-League All-Stars would still score 95 points a game in the NBA despite every player being below average; they might score points but there's no sense in which they are actually ""contributing"" anything. The only true value in the NBA is value above replacement or value above average.

Going back to your OP above I narrowly agree with the point that narratives often get out of control, but because of how basketball works, the NBA is structurally a superstars-driven league and a championship-fixated league. In this lens it's not unreasonable to look at questions like ""can player X win a championship as the best player on a team assuming a reasonable supporting cast"". This isn't to say that the discourse around such questions is always illuminating, but these are not essentially bad or wrong questions. || The problem with this example is that a player like Jokic doesn’t grow on trees, whereas his teammates are pretty replaceable, as u/internet_poster helpfully spells out. 


You’re technically correct that the rest of them combined “contribute more to the offence” (in some narrow sense), but there is only one player on that team whose absence would represent a total death knell to their title hopes, or whose contributions are particularly additive. This line of thought is exactly why a team like the Wizards would probably trade their entire roster for a player like Wemby, and then scramble to find slop to surround him with and eventually build from there. The Wizards combined roster might have a higher sum total of raw box score happenings (points, rebounds, assists), but they’d all get shipped for one player. || So if you can’t ignore them then they have to be included. Nothing is in a vacuum even impact on winning, or individual performances. So you can’t talk about those without including circumstances around them. Same with strategy or intangibles. || 💯
But the national media doesn’t even really try. Podcasts have proven to us lots of players don’t think particularly deeply about the game either. 
So what we get are people who don’t know what they are looking at getting validation was guys who don’t think about how they did what they did. 
There are brilliant players and broadcasters out there but we get the Inside Guys and Stephen A. 
I refuse to believe there is t a market for great, entertaining shows that are actually about basketball and just not Bitter nostalgia fests. || That's where my ""they're dumb"" part comes from. When you said they don't want to think of it as a strategy game that's extremely dumb to me. That's just what basketball is. They need these big sweeping, absolute terms like ""bag"" to paint with a wide brush but that's just not what basketball is. They're completely aware of what it is but for them to be challenged, they would have to admit they might be wrong. || No problem, as a Raptors fan I felt compelled to get that right as it stings to think about lol || Our sub has a few posts a year asking for everyone’s high quality nba media suggestions. I would start with browsing one of the many previous threads on the topic. || If Tatum was drafted by LA he would have to play KD Warriors to reach Finals. || I agree 100%. 

I think that, honestly, one of the biggest issues is that a large portion of criticism today’s hoopers face comes from ppl who CANNOT, DID NOT, or DO NOT CURRENTLY play the game. 

I use the NFL as a comparison. No matter WHAT is happening, ppl who played football show a certain level of respect to the guys who currently play. Ppl who never played football make sure to always maintain that their opinions aren’t informed by actual experiences that come from putting that helmet on. 

Basketball is different. ANYBODY can say ANYTHING, and as long as there’s someone that will co-sign it, it stands. || I’ve NEVER heard a conversation regarding the difference between Mario Lemieux and whoever is the best player in the NHL today. And I DEFINITELY don’t hear former NHL players calling the current players soft and weak. || Ask yourself where did this all start? The tearing down of former NBA eras. And why? The answers become pretty clear pretty quick. || That part really surprises me too. There are a few players who give current players their flowers like Allen Iverson, but some former players do not partake in this. Looking at you Dennis Rodman for saying you could clamp LeBron (source: https://foxsportsradio.iheart.com/content/2020-05-03-dennis-rodman-on-guarding-lebron-james-i-would-have-locked-his-a-up/), looking at you Jay Williams for saying LeBron is a ""Pippen"" (source: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2907537-lebron-james-responds-to-jay-williams-saying-he-was-pippen-to-wades-jordan). I surmise that these players become defensive and critical of current players because they want to justify that ""their era"" was the best. By undermining current players as ""soft"" and elevating your contemporaries, you make the case for why your era was better. || To be honest I've heard quite a lot of my friends who watch football (the round-ball kind) complaining about the sport in a similar vein as some (sometimes me too!) complain about modern basketball. I think it's a natural instinct to dislike change if you've grown watching what might seem a quite different spectacle. Not saying it's good, but that must play a part. || Exactly. 

I’m not a baseball guy, but I can’t say I’ve heard a stream of media content explaining how the current players aren’t as good as the older ones. Cuz it’s still baseball, and ppl that LOVE BASEBALL always lead with the love, and not necessarily reckless criticism. || Sports can devolve too. Just because changes to the game come to fruition doesn't mean such changes are good/healthy, whether those changes come naturally or are more enforced.

Like, the NBA used to not even have a 3 point line. Most will agree that adding the 3 shot was good for the game, but nowadays it has become an exploitable feature, and teams chasing that exploit is in-turn producing some of the lamest ""accidental basketball"" exhibited. Same thing with the hop-step.

I really wish people on both sides would get off the ""Then vs. Now"" boat and put more focus on the integrity and exhibition of the actual sport, because that's what's being lost in all of this back n forth bickering. || Thank you. You should continue writing then. None of I don't know. I've seen a lot of fans who have been following the NBA for decades, way longer than I have, and they still haven't graduated from the narrative style of thinking about basketball. Yes, and if 699 things fall in place but 1 thing does not, then that could cost a team a chance to win. Of course, winning a title is extremely tough and more likely than not, if you bet against a player to never win a title, you'll probably be right. That does not make your arguments sound or cogent though, it just means you are statistically likely to be right. || Thanks. Appreciate it. || I agree with everything you said. It's why Jokic has won MVP 3 of the last 4 seasons. He is not replaceble. He is probably the most irreplaceable player (outside of Wemby) in the league. Even if his teammates are replaceble, they need to contribute collectively at least the same or more than he does to win games consistently and over a large sample size. How do you quantify those ""additive"" contributions tangibly? || When given ample opportunities and playing time, a great player will transcend their circumstances and perform well. That's why you can evaluate their individual performances and how they impact winning under a large enough sample size. I cannot think of a single example where a player got ample amounts of playing time and opportunity AND was a good NBA player, yet didn't succeed individually? Except in the case of injuries, of course. || Yeah, Shaq even said (pharaphrasing here) that basketball IQ is not a big deal and that he did not need it (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgA5XwjTWSg). Shaq is not exactly the most eloquent voice in basketball discourse even though he is among the pantheon great basketball players. There are the JJ Redick's of the world and other quality YouTube channels like Thinking Basketball and BBALLBREAKDOWN shows there is a market for engaging basketball content. || I peruse this subreddit often and there are a few gems on here for sure. Thanks. || > Ppl who never played football make sure to always maintain that their opinions aren’t informed by actual experiences that come from putting that helmet on.

Since fucking when lmao. Every sport fanbase is FULL of fans who never played the sport and have no idea what they're talking about but i have never once, in regard to literally any sport, seen/heard someone say ""i never played so take my opinion with a grain of salt but...""

I agree with you in general but suggesting that this isnt a problem in football is genuinely insane || Yep, no wonder that people complain about the 3pt era. We view the past through rose-colored glasses and think that having two inside bigs and having to give Bill Cartwright (no slight to this man, just an example) post touches is better than the space and pace, high IQ offenses we have today. || That's exactly right! Like betting against someone is basically betting heavily with the odds. For some reason people feel so elated when someone doesn't succeed, I really don't like that aspect of fandom. || > Even if his teammates are replaceable, they need to contribute collectively at least the same or more than he does to win games. 

Sort of, but not all “contributions” are actually a positive to the team. The fact that these players are replaceable is an implicit nod to that. 


> How do you quantify those “additive” contributions tangibly. 

The advanced metrics you cite would be a good place to start. Take EPM, currently considered to be the gold standard in terms of win-predictiveness, and apply it to Jokic: his individual EPM is +8.8. The second to fifth best players are at +7.3 *combined* (adjusting for minutes/missed time/aggregate considerations it’s probably actually somewhere around +6.5). Everyone else on the roster is in the negative. || Bc it’s hypothetical situations which is hard to do. You can’t remove their circumstances. It’s football but Tom Brady gets drafted to the jets and not only is he not in the goat conversation he’s a nobody. How about Pippen what’s his individual performances without Jordan? How about the spurs players without Duncan? Do Parker or Manu have anywhere near the careers without him? And I mentioned this one. But what is Lebrons individual performances if he never left the cavs and had zero supporting cast his whole career. Does he have a 40-15-10 season? Does he retire 10 years ago bc he’s tired of carrying a team on his back. And yeah must of them would have at least some level of success. Does cooper Flagg go to the spurs or the wizards. Those have to be completely different career trajectories. || Or less say Chet. Last year he helped take the thunder from a play in team to the top team in a stacked western conference. What would you say his impact on winning was at the end of last season?  How about now? He has missed the majority of this season and the Thunder are having a historically good season. Or last year Luka had an all time great playoff performance. What if the thunder sweep the Mavs. He doesn’t even have an opportunity to then. || More limited players are probably better at this stuff because if they couldn’t “think” the game they often couldn’t play. 
I want to see a panel with a mixture of a coach, an analyst/journalist, and an ex player. || You talkin bout FANS. I really don’t care about that, and it seems to me that the majority of players don’t care about it either. Everyone knows fans, by definition, are emotional, and prone to say ANYTHING. 

I’m talking bout MEDIA. It’s gotta be annoying to turn on a tv and see A guy/girl that’s never done anything you’ve done hoop and holler about the job YOU DID, while using the opinions of the dumb fans you eluded to to shield him/her from the same critique and criticisms they seem so entitled to deliver. || To be fair, that Cartwright shot was disgusting to watch and no amount of rose-colored glasses will make it look nice. || My primary complaint about the 3pt era is the imbalance between offense and defense.  It's not about revisionist history or rose colored glass.  

I also didn't like watching Shaq after the first several hundred dunks.  Yes, he was amazing but I get it.  It's boring to watch the same thing over and over again regardless if he was a freak of nature exploiting his size and speed.

Next, I also didn't enjoy watching dead ball era games that finished with under 80 points scored.  Inability to score was also not fun to watch.

Today, offense has been so propped up by officiating that 3pt shots are the most efficient shot by far unless you're right on top of the rim.  Give defense the ability to touch the offensive player and don't bail the offense out with lax rules around moving screens, extra steps, foul baiting, etc. and maybe the 3pt shot will still be most efficient but only for elite shooters.

We've all played video games where you can exploit a weakness and spam the same thing over and over in order to win.  This is what I see when I watch the inability for defense to really make a big difference.  Some players can and do try hard on defense but officiating makes it seem as though they're playing against a stacked deck. || >Sort of, but not all “contributions” are actually a positive to the team.

Can you explain why that is so? That is not intuitive or obvious to me.

>Take EPM, currently considered to be the gold standard in terms of win-predictiveness, and apply it to Jokic: his individual EPM is +8.8. The second to fifth best players are at +7.3 *combined* (adjusting for minutes/missed time/aggregate considerations it’s probably actually somewhere around +6.5). Everyone else on the roster is in the negative.

Excellent. That makes your case more compelling. This seems like a fine statistic to use when evaluating players just reading up on it. The creator of the stat makes it difficult for an unpaid user to search for specific players but I'll take your word for it. The creator of this stat acknowledges that ""defensive stats are very much lacking"" (source: https://dunksandthrees.com/about/epm) when it comes to the Statistical Plus-Minus (SPM) component of EPM. For example, for the 2025 season, Alex Caruso (who is still an otherwordly defender) has an Defensive EPM of +4.5 whereas Wemby has a Defensive EPM of +2.8, when Wemby was the favorite to win DPOY before he got hurt. It also claims that in 2016, Chris Paul's EPM is 7.7+ whereas Steph Curry's was +7.3 so it is not infallible as a predictive measure of a season based on the player's career up to that point. We know Curry won the unanimous MVP that year and led his team to 73 wins. I also cannot see the actual EPM for a specific season in the past as that seems to be available for paid users. Also, individual metrics, when used alone, can be misleading when not used in conjunction with others. If there are other widely respected metrics that point to Jokic being more impactful than his teammates collectively and/or if you can clarify your claim on contributions above, I'm willing to concede and agree with you."
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-02-28,nbadiscussion,1j0hguj,The Luka Lakers Are Figuring It Out... Thanks to LeBron's evolution from his heliocentric role into a 0.5 battering ram.,"The morning I filled in for Adam Mares on the All-NBA podcast with Tim Legler, I watched Los Angeles lose to Charlotte. As I took notes and pulled clips, I could only feel disbelief at how clunky the Los Angeles offense looked with two players trying to play the same role: heliocentric alpha.

LeBron James and Luka Doncic have thrived in this role throughout their NBA careers. They’re the basketball version of grandmasters chess players.

But like [Highlander, there can be only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcLjcSloXs), and as to the question of who would be that *one* for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

Players often say they want to win, but they really mean, “I want to win, but I want to do it playing my way.”

The Charlotte game felt like a line of demarcation for this team. Two heliocentric grandmaster chess players wouldn’t give them the best chance to win, so an evolution had to happen.

**Two BIG things have stood out to me since that Charlotte game:**

1. LeBron’s shift into a 0.5 Player
2. The Roberson Rule

**LeBron’s Final Act:**

LeBron James has shifted from the only role he’s ever known in the NBA into a 0.5 player[1](#footnote-1). This is a massive step for someone of his caliber; he’s undoubtedly one of the top players to play this game.

Since the clunky Charlotte game, Los Angeles has won four games in a row, three of which have featured both James and Doncic. In those three victories, James recorded his two lowest games of the season in average touch length and average dribbles per touch.

During the Los Angeles win over Denver, James set a season low for average touch length (2.892 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.83).

The Denver game was the only time during the 24/25 that he had been under three seconds per touch or two dribbles. Until the Los Angeles win over Minnesota, James again set a season low for average touch length (2.581 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.44).

The data indicates precisely what the eye test says: LeBron has shifted into the 0.5 player this team needed to reach its ceiling, and he and the Los Angeles Lakers are thriving!

**LeBron James Closeouts:**

* Before Luka: 1.033 Points Per Chance (52nd Percentile)
* After Luka: 1.351 Points Per Chance (87th Percentile)

One of the most significant benefits of James relinquishing the highlander role to Doncic has been seeing his first three steps transition from then defensive end to offense. James no longer waits for every outlet pass to control the chess board; he knows Doncic sees the same picture he does, so he gets on his horse and goes!

James has long been one of the league's best, if not its best athlete. However, creating offense in the NBA takes energy, and that burden fell on James more times than not. But with Doncic in Los Angeles, the on-ball burden is gone, and LeBron’s athleticism has been unleashed every play they’re on the court together.

**The Roberson Rule:**

JJ Reddick is using the NBA regular season as a defensive lab experiment. One theory he’s been beta testing is [Seth Partnow’s “Roberson Rule.”](https://x.com/SethPartnow)

The past week, Aaron Gordon, Russell Westbrook, Dante Exum, Naji Marshall, Jaden McDaniels, Jaylen Clark, and Tarrence Shannon Jr. have received Reddick's version of Partnow's Roberson Rule.

One of the things I always tell agents, scouts, or front office members when discussing shooting is that volume matters. Yes, it’s great to be a 40% shooter from the three-point line, but if the player turns down open → semi-open shots to pass or drive into traffic, the percentage doesn’t matter because they can be put into a box defensively.

The Roberson Rule is that box.

Since January 15th, Los Angeles has been first in defensive rating, opponents’ points in the paint, and opponents’ FG%. The results are straightforward; the lab experiment is working.

Reddick is unwilling to concede gravity to players he doesn’t believe will shoot enough volume to beat them. Instead, he chooses to shrink the defensive shell and shift more gravity to players who *can* beat Los Angeles, like Jokic, Kyrie, and Anthony Edwards.

# Ben Taylor showed what that extra gravity looks like when shifted towards a player (Jokic).

Even a few makes from Gordon and Westbrook didn’t shake his resolve in the Roberson Rule strategy; it takes volume. Your shooting gravity is not defined by your percentage but by a combination of three factors: Percentage, Volume, and Mechanics.

He knows that players who have never shot 15 threes in an NBA game don’t know how to deal with the emotional swings of missing nine threes and it still being a good thing for the team, and he’s betting on players not being able to step that far outside the Overton Window of volume.The Luka Lakers Are Figuring It Out...",1461,107,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j0hguj/the_luka_lakers_are_figuring_it_out_thanks_to/,2025-02-28 15:29:35,"Great article! As a Lakers fan the Roberson rule has been very noticeable on defense, taking away their best player (see the coverages on Jokic and Ant) in exchange for giving low volume shooters an open 3.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || Side note but remember the “lebron can’t play off ball narrative”

Like idk where the even came from. Ig cause he’s always been the guy with the ball in his hands so they just assume he can’t. Especially with how much his shooting has improved, he’s lethal off ball. Saves energy and now he can use it to get boards, play defense, etc. his vision allows him to be a menace when cutting to the basket too. || Could someone please explain what a “0.5 player” is? I may be missing something, but I read the article on substack and tried a google search and I have not found an explanation that matches the context here. || Just want to point out - We are talking about how a 40 yr old finally unleashed his athleticism. || This was a fun read. Great analysis. Makes a lot of sense with their new personnel being fast enough for a close out on those guys instead of a proper gravity cover. I’ll be on the lookout for this next game. || Great article - one of LeBron’s main strengths has always been how remarkably well rounded he is in his game, combined with his brain. Even with that, I’ve been suprised how fast he has essentially worked out off ball play with Luka - is there any historical parallels of anyone doing this before? || [removed] || [removed] || [removed] || LeBron is trusting Luka - it also gives LeBron more rest and energy to do more dirty work and make plays when it matters, at this age this helps him chill a bit more and dial it up when it matters. || This was a great read, esp as a Laker/Bron fan rooting for him get that last championship run. || [removed] || Hey correct me if I’m wrong please but it feels like Taylor Jenkins also loves the “Roberson rule” and as an all 82 grizzlies watcher it frustrates me more than anything. It worked great vs Jrue Holiday but since then it feels like we’ve been burnt more than helped. || Bro I fucking hate Dallas for this. I’m finally ready to protest something lol || Lebron is getting more catch and shoot 3 opportunities, quality looks made possible by Luka having so much gravity and being an elite passer.

Then of course Lebron can rim run and is one of the best in transition which is easy money for a full court passing threat like Luka

People are mentioning Luka’s shooting slump, which is normal after an injury, but when you realize how often he’s double teamed and blitzed that’s what creates shot quality for other guys || LeBron’s never actually been heliocentric. We’ve gotten too liberal with the word. He’s always given other guys the opportunity to create, he’s always been a good cutter, he’s always utilized some post ups if the guard doesn’t have many options, etc 

Ball dominant? Yes

Heliocentric? No || > But like Highlander, there can be only one, and as to the question of who would be that one for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

I kind of disagree with this framing, as if LeBron playing off ball is the result of Luka being the better player, which he hasn't been in LA so far. LeBron even ceded ball handling duties to Westbrook to become a screen and short roll player when they were in the lineup together. To me this arrangement is the result of LeBron covering up Luka's weakness as an off ball player in the same way he covered up Anthony Davis' weakness as an on ball player. 

Even at this age, LeBron has less weaknesses than Luka and can do everything well and is an elite play initiator and finisher. Depending on what he has on his team, he can do either. So he's adapting his game to utilize the strengths of his teammate because he can in a way less flexible players cannot. || This isn’t accurate.

Since Luka arrived, LeBron’s touches per game have actually increased from 85.6 to 91.2, along with his scoring, which has jumped from 24.5 to 28.2 points per game.

For context, LeBron’s 91.2 touches per game surpass Luka’s 78.2.

Luka has merely come in to play point guard and distribute the ball to LeBron, but he hasn’t yet been the “alpha” or “Highlander” on the Lakers. LeBron has found a way to maintain that role—despite the devastating impact of 0.74 fewer dribbles per touch (shocking!). || I think Denver can put lineups out there (sans Westbrook) where you won’t feel as comfortable as you did last game. 

I think as teams see this more, they'll try to adjust as best they can. 

Boston can handle this coverage (obviously). Doing this on Golden State is scary because even though Green can't shoot, he's always a threat to get into quick two-man game actions with Curry or Buddy, who you must be up at the level to prevent open shots. || Hard to play this defense against the Bucks. I've seen teams all year focus on taking Dame away but then there is Giannis. As for role players AJ Green will gladly jack up 10+ 3s. To a lesser extent so will GTJ and Lopez. Portis & Prince will throw up 10 3s if given open looks as well. || [removed] || Boston, Cleveland || They playing the avgs. || Fully healthy wolves can run a lineup of DDV, Ant, Jaden, Naz, Rudy.   That lineup will launch 3s if left open, that type of defense would have a strong possibility of being a catastrophic decision. || Nice article! My only suggestion would be to explain what a 0.5 man is. I had no idea and had to find that in the comments. The Roberson Rule at least gets explained in the tweet that you have linked in the article (but not here). || nice piece, def enjoyed!  || I was hoping your substack would define this, what is a 0.5 player exactly? || Great work man, posts like yours keep me coming back here. Well done!! || Agreed.  In hindsight, someone with that much knowledge on playmaking is going to be amazing off ball - knowing exactly where to go for other playmakers. || He played off ball with Wade quite a bit and was a menace. I don't know how anyone thought he'd struggle.  He shot 40% from 3 with Wade, albeit on low attempts. But he's definitely a better shooter now than in Miami. || it was never about “LeBron can’t play off-ball” but rather “it’s not worth letting someone else play on-ball instead of LeBron”. For the first time ever, there is a player LeBron is playing with who is better than him offensively and it now makes sense for LeBron to play off-ball. Before that, even the likes of Dwyane Wade and Kyrie Irving were not enough to overcome how much of a clear advantage it was to give LeBron the rock || It was because him playing off ball was always noticeably worse than him having the ball. Not because he was bad at it but because he’s top 2 all time at having the ball in his hands || People really said any old thing about LeBron, didn’t they? It’s pretty clear he became a primary ball handler because he had to and developed the skills accordingly. He never identified as a guard. || Bron does what he wants || The idea is you have to make a decision quickly(.5 seconds). So as soon as you catch, either pass shoot or attack. You hear the spurs and warriors talk about it a lot || Quick decisionmaking, whether it's moving the ball or moving forward with it or moving without the ball, to maintain whatever advantage the offense has and not let the defense get back into position. 

Beautiful game Spurs highlights will drive home just how significant it is, as they were able to have 5 lineups with guys playing that way at a high level. Part of the reason why a ""ball stopper"" has been so bad for an offense is because they're the antithesis of this, and even though that term is often used for players who are inefficient that negative effect can persist even when they're not. || I am also lost. cc: /u/low_man_help || I see this has been answered already. I just wanted to say thanks for reading, and I'll try to include a footnote next time about things like this. || I’m in the same boat here. || Pretty remarkable. || Thanks! I’m glad you enjoyed it. The Lakers have been fun to watch this past week, alot of times the Lakers defenders are 10+ feet away during the shots (per SS), a lot of “dare you to shoot” action going on. || I’m sure there’s an NBA parallel, but it reminds me of when dudes like Randall Cobb have been QB their entire life before becoming the slot WR in the NFL.

They didn’t forget how to play smart offense just because they’re now running hot routes instead of throwing them. || For a player of his stature, never.

People have asked him to do it for years, but he’s never trusted anyone to take on his role with the ball. 

^^ Because no one created the advantages others he did. Luka can make the same one. || The most famous picture of him and Wade on the Heat was LeBron being off-ball and Wade passing him an alley-oop on a hard cut. || In basketball, where the basketball is the center of the game, can you explain how being ball-dominant is not also being heliocentric? || This isn’t referencing one player being better or worse than the other. 

It’s more about a long-term organizational timeline—the 25-year-old with a 10+ year runway was always going to be the one to keep that role over a 40-year-old with a 1-4 year timeline. || The touches stat wasnt for the period since Luka arrived though, reread it || It kind of feels like you're just making my point further but somehow trying to be combative about it. Not sure why. || But then again if teams adjust their lineup to more offensive oriented line up to counter the Lakers defensive strat they will sacrifice their defense especially if you are up against 4 good offensive players in Luka/Lebron/Reaves/Rui.

Jokes and memes are not permitted. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || Heliocentricity is when a player has *everything* revolve around them. The term originates from the belief of the universe revolving around the earth - everything around it

You can be a ball dominant player without literally having *everything* revolve around you

LeBron is ball dominant. He has the ball a lot, he’s the driver of an offense, but he doesn’t dominate every single possession. Throughout his career he has constantly flexed off-ball utilizing actions like cuts, post-ups, and attacked off of spot-ups as he gives his standard costar guard an opportunity to take up some possessions as well. He’s always achieved some balance. Throughout much of his career, people begged him to not be this way and just do *everything* all the time

Heliocentric is peak Houston Harden. *Every* possession of the Rockets offense was directly dictated by something he did with the ball. There essentially was no alternative some of those years. There was no off-possession. No off-ball actions, nothing. He was responsible for basically every offensive outcome 

Players like SGA, Giannis, Embiid, etc are also pretty clearly ball dominant. I don’t think you’d call them heliocentric, would you? || If the young star with the longer timeline were an Anthony Edwards type instead, you'd still give the ball to LeBron because of the skill set and how it maximizes both players. 

The other aspect of this framing that feels off to me is that it's even a role the two players are fighting for. LeBron's been itching to play off ball forever. The Lakers front office traded perfect heliocentric complement Danny Green for Dennis Schroeder. Then they traded more 3 and D role players for Russell Westbrook. And in between those seasons and now, LeBron put very public pressure on the Lakers to trade for Kyrie Irving. Those aren't the moves you push for if you want to have the ball in your hands all the time. || Boston and Golden State. That’s it. OKC you sell out on SGA and tell Lu Dort to beat you from 3. He is very hot and cold, and he sort of needs to be on the floor, because Dort is the single best Luka defender in the League. || This is very important. If they want to counter this kind of defense, they have to put offensive minded players who likes to shoot but those players are mostly not good defensively. LebronAustinLuka will kill you offensively. Even if they get hot, the Lakers can put Gabe, DFS and Vando to slow them down. However, not sure if this works during the playoffs. But still a team with Luka as first option and Lebron as 2nd option with Austin as 3rd will be too much for a lot of teams. I hope everyone stays healthy because this could be very fun playoffs with the variety of how teams are constructed. || Yeah it’s not just that you can’t key into anyone but also that they have two guards that will pull for 3 if you don’t fight over screens. Lakers have no one that can fight over screens besides sort of reaves and 0 offense Gabe Vincent. They have to switch everything and then you have Darius garland or Donovan Mitchell repeatedly isoing Luka, which is even worse than Jayson Tatum and Jaylen brown doing so like last year.

Lakers will continue to play good, smart, active team defense in the playoffs but their weakness in iso defense (Luka and AR are both solid team defenders but bad on an island) can be exposed most readily by the Cavs. || Thank you!! Hope you enjoy the rest of the pieces on there || just another piece of evidence that almost directly undermines the complaints about too many 3s. 3s are being generated in different ways by every team. takes more than a first glance to understand players aren’t just jacking up shots for no reason other than 3>2 || Yeah I think fans (myself included) don't realize how much energy it takes to be the focal point of the offense, especially at age 40. Him not handling the ball every possession has allowed him to spend that energy on all the other aspects of his game. || Correct! Tobias is a 5.0 player. || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || is 2018 lebron heliocentric? || I think you could throw the Cavs in there, but maybe not since they also have other ways to score. Being the most efficient team in the NBA means making the best play, which sometimes is at the rim. || good thing they are in the East! Its interesting tho because I think the Cavs will have to figure out how they can impact Luka and Lebron as defenders with no one on their team possessing the size enough to really affect their playstyle. So while the Cavs could exploit, I feel like the Lakers are a bad matchup for them as well because their best players are guards and centers whereas the Lakers are both 6 foot 7-9 do it all hybrid players w incredible court vision || I disagree. What would happen is that the Lakers would switch and sell out hard to the three point line on isos. Any blow by would then run into a packed paint leaving Mobley and Allen open at the 3 point line or the dunkers spot. Okoro would also be left open. 

Also offensively the Lakers are the worst Cavs matchup possible. Luka and LeBron absolutely love going matchup hunting, and both would abuse Garland and Mitchell, who are just not big enough to guard them. || That’s why he kept asking for “playmakers”, which tbf every star needs around them, but it’s especially noticeable with stars that are AARP eligible.

The Lakers just kept going for “playmakers” with no jumpers. || Lest we forget to tortoise and the haire. Tobias out here playing 5d connect four || Against the Cavs, I am interested to see what the Lakers do, but my instinct is that they pack the paint and tell Mobley to beat them from 3, in a similar way to what they did for Aaron Gordon. || I would think Mobley wade and hunter would be decently good matchups on d.  All have a combo of size/length/strength to hold their ground || That's a good point about the cavs defense, I'm wondering if a series would end up looking like the 90s with all the post ups--except it's two 6'8 guards posting up on 6'3 guys and looking to create instead of 7 footers duking it out.

I do think you're kind of describing the issue with the lakers weaknesses, though. When you go to make up for them what ends up happening is you create other weaknesses, and the Cavs have the shooters to punish. || If they pack the paint, it won’t be Mobley beating them from three. || Lmao u can’t put Garland AND MItchell on the same court against Luka and LeBron they will get hunted relentlessly || Lol Mobley is WAY too slight for Lebron and not a perimeter defender…hunter and dean wade man come on lol. They are alright players overall but lets be real || I’m not sure I buy the Cavs shooting in the playoffs though. Their closing lineups will all have Mobley in, if not Allen as well. The Lakers will just sag off them the same way they do to everyone else. I’m genuinely very concerned about the Cavs in the playoffs. They are fantastic but they have so many exploitable weaknesses. || What the Lakers have played is a paint focused defence where they then close out hard on good shooters - so whoever the Cavs have 1-3, and leave bad or just low volume shooters open, so Mobley and Okoro would probably be left wide open. || Thanks for the insight. I guess we’ll see. His 3 is coming along, but it’s his first year really exploring it. He shot some last year, but has a lot more this year.  All part of the progression to superstar. || Okoro probably wouldn’t see the court much if we met in the finals, and Mobley plays the 5 a lot of the time with 4 shooters since we stagnant him and JA’s minutes. If lakers tried that we’d just go small ball with some combination of DG, Spida, Strus, Jerome, Hunter, Wade, or Merrill, with Mobley at the 5."
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-03-02,nbadiscussion,1j2c53x,Is it possible for LeBron James to score 50k regular season points?,"I can't believe I'm going to make an argument for this, but with Luka on the team now, LeBron might actually barely reach 50k points.
 
This season, LeBron James is averaging 25 ppg and has only missed 5 games out of a possible 59. However, his scoring has shown a clear upwards trajectory over the past month, so assuming he will average 27 points, playing 20 out of the Lakers' possible 23 games, LeBron James will end this season with 42377 points. 

We know LeBron will play in 2025-26. Let's assume he stays at 26 ppg for that year, playing around 73 games. This is around the same as last yr, and with a primary playmaker, we can assume a similar volume. At the end of the 2025-26 season, LeBron will have 44275 points. 

Now we enter speculation zone. However, I think it's probable that LeBron would sign at least 1 more two year contract, especially if the Lakers are contending, which is seeming likely. 

In 2026-27, LeBron would become 42, which means we should expect some dropoff.... but should we? I personally believe LeBron will lose some step by this time, but not so much that he would be scoring less than 24 ppg. Assuming he misses around 9 games again, this brings LeBron James to 46027 points. 

At this point, we see the vision. If LeBron James decides to chase the 50k mark, he can play 3 more seasons playing only 60 games a season, and average 23 for that to get there.

If he's still averaging 25 for 70 games in 2028, he'd be at 47777 at the end of his contract, which means he'd only need to average 16 a game for two more seasons playing 70 games. If he only plays 60 games, for those last years, he'd only need to average 19. 

It is possible, given his current trajectory, that LeBron James will retire with 50k career points to his name. The fuckery will, in fact, continue.",990,234,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j2c53x/is_it_possible_for_lebron_james_to_score_50k/,2025-03-03 01:07:54,"He’d have to play another 7 years or so. It’s probably **possible** but it’s not going to happen unless he changes his mind. Even he said he doesn’t want to play for 5-7 years more || It is possible. I just don’t think he will play that long. I’m a huge Bron fan. I hope that he plays forever and puts every longevity stat completely out of reach, but I just don’t see him playing beyond 2028 and even that might be a stretch. || Yeah I think if he wants to keep playing, 50k is within reach. It's absurd how good he's been this season, barely any regression in his game from the past few seasons. || I think father time will stop this from happening. Lebron himself said that he won't be here when the 2028 Olympics comes around. He's already owns the points record so there's really no incentive to hit 50k points. || No. What LeBron is doing is incredible, but he can't do this for 6 more years. Father time catches all. || I fear time will stop him. I see it going similar to Nowitzki were rather suddenly he will  move like a man his age ;) || There is no way he does this, as much as I would want him to. Maybe he gets to 45k. || Don’t get me wrong, we have all been burned before by assuming LeBron will stop eventually. 

But he won’t go on forever. I think another 4 years is the absolute limit of what we’ll see from him. Including his player option, he’s contracted until the summer of 26. I could see him sign another year with a player option, maybe 2 with a player option beyond that if the Lakers are contending and he’s still contributing at an all-star level. 

But as soon as he stops being seen as one of the best in the league, I think he’s done. Yes, he could in theory get to 50k points, but there’s a lot of things in basketball he COULD do, that there comes a point where continuing to set goals is near impossible. Because what’s next? 55k? 60k? Hell, if he’s still an elite player at age 46, does he want to be the first NBA player to be 50 years old and still in the league? Once the scoring record is out of anyone else’s reach in a year or two, does he start looking at Stockton’s assist record?? No matter how long he plays, there will ALWAYS be a goal he could’ve reached but left on the table. || If Lebron gets to 50k regular season points, I'll go ahead, buy whatever Lebron shoe is coming out that year and eat it in front of a camera and post it on reddit. || He can if he wants to. But does the FO want to pay him near max or max money given that they have Luka on the team? The money to be paid would go to an up and coming guy or some bench pieces that would make the team well rounded instead of the current pieces they have. || At this point, he doesn’t want to keep playing in the league to just hit a 50k mark. It is physically and emotionally taxing to have to doing the offseason workouts, the ramping up, the early morning shoot around and the traveling. He probably wants to retire and have his family life and other career (movie, shoes, endorsements) take off. For me as a basketball fan, I would like to see LeBron keep pushing the limits of his age and defy aging and keep up his insane consistency. But I totally understand his perspective. || If Luka takes over I wonder if there’s a world where LeBron does go after it and maybe transitions to a bench guy in a few years. Play 15 mpg during the regular season. Guide and develop the bench unit, able to play close games at the end when he’s needed, do more in the playoffs? 

With his basketball brain and considering how well his body has held up, he may not have stamina, but could a fresh, 45 year old LeBron still give you 15-20 really
Impactful minutes? That seems quite possible. || I don’t think there will be a major drop off but there will be a slow decline which has already started. It’ll get to a point where he dips below 17ppg and the argument for 50,000 will die. It’s just too much || I would love if LeBron does that. But realistically no. I do think with Luka and especially if lakers can get a title this year, LeBron extends his playing time by one more year. I say Bron plays 2 more years after this season. || As a Lakers fan, I was against signing Bronny. It seemed like a waste of a pick.

But now I'm wondering if LeBron's incredible season isn't in part due to his great enthusiasm for playing with Bronny. Could have helped give him the mental boost to keep going full bore at the age of 40. || Announce random drug testing and he will retire this year. Or at least within the year. 

And yes, everyone does it now. Obviously. But im being forced by the media to think the new juiced up guys are better than Larry bird because the extra juice allowed their bodies to break down later. Sorry, can't do that. || He is already #1. I could see him going for 45k pretty easily and considering that a career well done. He doesn't have anything more to prove or accomplish in a rankings sense, at least nothing he can control. || At first when I read this, I thought it was crazy. After reading the comments though, it's giving me flashbacks to a thread from maybe 10 years ago that was basically saying that Lebron could realistically break Kareems record. All of these comments are saying the same exact things they were saying back then lol. || Legit question - if he slowed down (say from father time or injury) a tick or two, wouldn't his strength, frame, and skill set still make a great center for 20 minutes a game? || Lebron scored 6,007 points in his first 3 seasons, through his age 21 season. Kareem was in college then. I think lebron will want to eclipse kareem by at least that number of points to ward off any argument that his record has an asterisk, because he got the benefit of three extra years in the league while kareem was dominating college. So i think he’ll want at least 45k || I’m guessing he goes for 45,000 then calls it a day.  No ones  catching that number. || yeah that’s super easy. So we just count his playoff points. bada bung bada boom. || I think it’s possible.

He’s already 40. Would his body really decline that much more by the time he’s 43-44? Probably not (barring any significant injuries). I think it comes down to motivation, and the Lakers will be contenders for at least the next 2 seasons. That’ll get him to 45k. From there, it’s all about how much he wants it.

One thing we should all know about LeBron is that he’s very petty - he would want nobody else to break his ATS record ever, and if he hits 50k it would surely cement that. || It's definitely possible. Currently he puts up at least 1500 pts a year during the regular season. As long as he shows no signs of slowing down, and maintains scoring 1500 pts a season, he can absolutely get it done in 6 years || technically possible but it won't happen. He's stated repeatedly his plan to retire in the near future (my guess is after 2028) and as he ages into his mid 40s the injuries will become more common || Is there a max age limit? Could bron be 60 and still play as long as there’s someone signing him? || It’s possible but he’s just not gonna wanna do it.  I’m pretty confident in saying that he’d still be a decent player at 45, I just don’t know why he’d wanna do that || I think it’s gonna be after the ‘28 season and the Olympics but it’s gonna come down to that Las Vegas expansion team really. Luka and his sons give him incentive to keep playing but I see 2-3 seasons after this, whenever they give him that team. || His longevity is truly unprecedented, so nobody can really say it's impossible because there's no reference to make predictions based on. That said, I think it's highly unlikely. || Possible, yes. Likely, no. 

He’s said on numerous occasions that he’s done everything he set out to. He has absolutely no reason to want to chase 50k reg season points. I’ll go out on a limb and say we’ll all be dead and gone before another generational athlete comes along and surpasses what he’s done. There’s not a single player in the NBA right now averaging 25+ that I can see sustaining that for 20+ seasons. || That's a huge stretch. I don't think anyone will ever hit 50k. Lebron, at best, would hit 45k || He's going to reassess once he hits 45k IMO.

Once he hits 45K he's going yo have to make a decision if he can do it for 3 more years... which is crazy to even say. || Assuming he will stay around 25ppg is maybe a stretch.  It’s definitely possible but you would assume eventually Father Time catches up || He looks to be having the most fun in his bball career..

it's amazing to watch Luka open up things for lebron unlike
Flip murray
mo williams
Mario Chalmers
Norris Cole
Kyrie
D lo

Lebron had to wait until 40 years old to play with his best teammate....kinda bittersweet || Basically the question is: can he sustain 27 PPG through age 44?

No, I don't think so.  Some of the best longevity players ever are Karl Malone (who retired at age 40 averaging 13.2 PPG), Kareem (who retired at age 41 averaging 10.1 PPG), Bob Parish (who retired at 43 averaging 3.7 PPG), Vince Carter (retired age 43 averaging 5.0 PPG), Nowitzki (40, 7.3), Stockton (40, 10.8), Garnett (39, 3.2), MJ (39, 20.0).

I think it's unlikely, but possible, that LeBron could still be playing through age 44.  But if he does, I have to imagine he'll be averaging something like 13 PPG in his 44th year of life. || If he is declining slowly buts still productive he should just keep playing. There are very few cases of top players retiring when they are still very good. 


Really only Jordan retired while still elite and he later came back with wizards. Lebron should use productivity not age to determine retirement. If he is averaging 20 on good efficiency with reasonable defense and health he should just keep playing.  || You really want to watch him drop dead playing don’t you? I suppose it’s possible, but probably far from likely. || The amount of people who claim and ""believe"" that he is on some kind of dope without zero evidence is the exact reason why the world is suffering from stupidity, why elon musk is throwing the roman salute in front of billions and why kanye is printing and wearing swastika tshirts, and why darvin ham still has a job in the league. || Don't get me wrong, it's a huge accomplishment, but I feel like that's not an accolade bron would care THAT much about, to play like 3 more seasons. Now 3 more rings, yeah sure but the math on that is way different and unpredictable so I doubt it. || Is it possible he plays 7 more years. yes. Will he? Absolutely NO. One goal stands above points. To retire near the top of his game. To be the top or next to top player on team. A record has very little incentive for him if he has injuries and fills in for other players. Please do not guess.... He will stay to get 47000 or 50000. He says he could play 7 more years ....could, but then says,  the end is close in sight. He wants to enjoy the game playing mainly injury free and be close to top of his game. To play when no longer fun, not a top star.... He has zero interest. Total numbers mean nothing because he is #1 now no record to break . All that said I think he will play 2 more years if all goes well.  I would not say 3 more years is impossible but unlikely. 4 no way. He will end career 44,500 to absolute max 47,000.  || I don’t think he needs to show anything else. He has already beaten all the records that matter for him. He gave a title to Cleveland. He said his last objective was to play with his son. Despite being still a beast in the game and undoubtedly remaining one of the greatest performers of this sport even at 40, I don’t think he will chase a 50k record, as it would be pointless from his point of view. || I highly doubt it. 

He’s in phenomenal shape — he has possibly the most dedicated fitness routine in the history of the league — but his athleticism has noticeably declined the last couple of years. 

I think he can make it another 2 to 3 years without a significant drop in production, and possibly another 2 to 3 years after that as a role player. But I’m convinced he’ll retire before that happens, **especially** if the Lakers win it all. 

Nobody wants to see 11 ppg LeBron. Especially him. || I think it’s more realistic that LeBron is targeting 25 years in the league, playing with both of his sons, and hitting 45,000 points. 

That’s just 3 more seasons, and he already committed to one more with the Lakers.

Next year when his two year contract is up he’ll renew it with them for another two and make the draft his son Bryce as well.

At that point if he is somehow still healthy and competing at a high level he’ll decide if he wants to push for 50,000 and another gold medal. || I would not wager on LeBron playing *over five more years*, much less on him averaging 25+ ppg at age 45. Come on. || I’d like to see LeBron finish with 50k regular season points, 10k playoff points, and another ring or two with Luka in town. None of those are very likely but would be amazing if he could reach them. || Talking about empty numbers...  
My opinion: there WILL be a career ending injury. I wish him well, but I'm pretty sure it will happen.  
No one, with or without balco, beats father time. || yeah... but if hes only 1000 points away after 4 years, I think he's going to go for it. || Idk I heard his new goal is to play with his grandkids || If he continues this play for 7 more seasons there is going to be a lot of PED talk || Yeah I don’t see it unless he really has a squad around him by that point and changes his mind, like you said || that said , he said that before the doncic trade || I've been watching Brady and LeBron for almost my entire sports watching life. 

Knowing ones gone and the other almost from their sports...just feels weird.  

Least we've still got Ovi and Verlander. || i hated him early on but have come around to accept that he is neck and neck for greatest peak and career ever. I really hope he plays until 2030. Doesn't help that I basically started following basketball around 2003, so checking for updates on LeBron is almost synonymous with my love for the NBA || I thought Lebron was toast during that November-December stretch where he looked awful and was putting up 4-16 FG games. My guess is that was from the Olympics exhaustion. He's had an incredible January-February stretch || fair enough, the only way he reaches that by 2028 is if he plays 75 games for 4 more years, averaging 26....... and I'm not sure if that's possible with his age || I will cry real man tears if he went to LA and won the Olympic gold one final time.

I never doubt him anymore. If he wanted to do it, I would have no questions of his abilities at the age of 44. None lmao. Guys a monster at this point he’s proved everyone wrong far too many times || didn’t he also say in like 2016/17 that he was done with the olympics for the rest of his career or something? wanting to focus on “chasing the ghost in Chicago”. then cut to 2024 lol. LeBron is known to contradict himself and go back on his words often. lebron will retire when he’s not a top 25 player anymore. his desire to play is mostly fueled by ego, i don’t think even he expected his body to hold up as long as it has lmao || we said that 6 years ago... and also, he doesn't even need to do it for 6 more years: an average decline will still get him over the finish line || Who knows at this point. Most players fall off between 34-38. This dude is 40 playing on the top 5 player list. || Except Brady.

It would have to be something like Brady did, which with we are seeing now with Rodgers (after Manning, Favre and co.) it is completely the exception to the rule. || I think LeBron would have to be 50+ before he starts moving like Dirk in his last season || [removed] || at this point i think 45k is a given || He might want to pass the ""oldest nba player ever"" record if he gets close. Its currently 45 years 363 days (so pretty much playing on his 46th birthday would net lebron the record) || !remindme 5 years || Is this a long way of saying you think Bird was better? || What new juiced up guys are you talking about. There’s only one 40 year old doing this and if everyone was juiced up why aren’t they performing like him? They also test for that in the Olympics.. He’s been to several. || Huh? LeBron from 23-34 was better than Larry Bird ever was, this is extremely evident when you account for pace, competition, and roster construction. || I don't think he cares about people trying to argue ifs,buts,candy, and nuts. If Kareem had played those extra years,he'd have had extra miles. Also,I think Kareem having Magic is similar to Lebron having Luka in terms of getting extra miles out of him.  I have Kareem as a GOAT contender, but I don't agree with the reasoning that he would've had the same longevity as Lebron if he had those extra four years. Managing what he did back then is impressive enough! || This would be a bad argument anyway because LeBron eclipsed Kareem’s scoring total in 150 fewer games (nearly two full seasons less than Kareem). || > He’s already 40. Would his body really decline that much more by the time he’s 43-44? 


Yes. The human body doesn't decay linearly, it speeds up quite a lot around his age. || wishing someone well and wishing a career ending injury upon them are mutually exclusive clauses || There's no way Lebron plays for another 4 years. At most he plays for another 3. My guess is he rides out one more year now that he's got Luka Doncic before announcing his retirement, and he'll be done at the end of 2027 || lol with LeBron all things are possible || Everyone’s on PED’s.

Edit: he does not have access to some secret juice that no other athlete including the likes of Steph Curry, Usain Bolt, KD, Mayweather, Messi, Ronaldo have. Everyone’s rich and has the ability to afford PED’s and afford to go through hiding their PED usage. || He's already been on hgh for many years || One thing that makes me think it’s possible is that since 2020 he seemed to be stressed and worn out mentally a lot more with longer bouts of frustration between him being happy on court. 

He even stated that his retirement would come when he wasn’t there for it mentally anymore.

But since the Luka trade and with the increased prospects of success he seems a lot more gleeful and youthful in his energy. 

If this has rejuvenated him mentally then I could see him playing longer than we think || that's awesome man || Same! I’m quite surprised with his energy on both sides of the court. JJ has done a wonderful job and so has LeBron buying in. || I think Austin Reeves growth as a primary ball handler aligns with that timeframe. Playing all this offball saves him enough energy to be an elite 2 way player again. Somehow. At 40. Lol. || could he still hypothetically be on the team if he's not in the NBA? maybe they'll just give him a spot as the king of LA lol || Yes, when he was 34. He is going to be 46 in 6 years. I doubt LeBron is going to want to play as a reduced version of himself. || 6 years ago he was 34 || I don’t think people were doubting it 6 years ago. He was relatively fresh off of a title and just signing with LA. 

46 is entirely different, especially for a guy LeBron’s size to try to stay in the shape he’s in today. There’s just so much more work to recover after games and in the offseason that a lot of older players get really burned out. It’s just a massive grind to say in game shape, which is a step beyond being in athletic shape, and a lot of veteran players retire to get away from that. LeBron himself kind of alluded to this when he started talking about retiring sooner than people think and the more chronic back and foot injuries we’ve seen him get over the past few seasons. 

I think your assumptions about him being healthy enough would be too far from given, if not unlikely. He’s been healthy for a season and a half now, but previously missed a lot of time the two seasons prior. Expecting him to average enough games to get there in 7 years isn’t likely if we average out his last three years. || There have been nba players that have been 40 before. Way worse than Bron but they have existed. 46 is literally 0 nba players. Past a certain point injury recovery, defense and the chance of catastrophic injury just becomes too high. || Sure, but he was a QB. Basketball requires a lot more athletism. || My statement comes mostly from watching soccer players. There is a “sudden” decrease in “athleticism” of 20-30% (those are just numbers, nothing scientific). The ones that take care of themself can delay it a bit longer bu it always comes.

And I took Dirk as an example because he went from “impressive what he does with his level of atlehtisicm” to “I hope he does not get hurt standing up from the bench” in a few months.

I dont’t think LeBron will have a slow decline like everybody says because the way he treats his body. It will be rather sudden. So I don’t think the 50k are in reach || He has to go on for around 5 years and a half more to get it. Not impossible. || Possibly. It's very close between the two. I think overall I'm forced to give it to lebron because he has accomplished so much and lebron at his peak was super dominant in his own right. But my point is that guys like bird, Hakeem and others haven't benefitted like lebron from ""modern medicine"", among other things, and they were so great already that I'm sort of compelled to imagine what they could have done given similar advantages. || Lebron didn't test during the Olympics. Everybody else did. 

And no large corporations are not about to bust the face of global basketball right now, he is protected lol || Kareem played college those years. Its not like he didnt play. Also idk if extra games played in your late teens early 20s add extra miles, apart from a big injury then. If anything its just more conditioning because your recovery is so much better at that age. 
Id like to see any proof that playing in college as opposed to the pros at a young age extends your career || Not really. Kareems three highest point totals were his first three years in the league. His lowest were his last three years in the league. If you were to replace kareems last three years with three years in his early 20s, he likely has at least 3,000 more career points in a similar amount of games || 10 years ago you would have said the same thing, but instead 43-44 it would have been 39-40. Well, here LeBron is at age 40.

He’s going to decline rapidly at some point, I agree, but maybe it’s between 45-50 as opposed to between 40-45? Who the fk knows man. He’s already defied all odds, and I wouldn’t count him out to have another couple years more of high production. || You are not very bright, are you?

Predicting that something will happen is not WISHING it.

Maybe you should do something with your hands, instead. You know, to be at least a little bit useful. || Nah its gonna be 2028, he gets to retire with 25 years + get 3 more chances at a ring + end his career with another olympic run || Who knows with that basketball psychopath. I doubt even the biggest Lebron fan would have thought when he joined the lakers that he'd be averaging 25ppg at 40. || He probably just wants to win 1ring and with Luka it’s a possibility. I’m sure he’s retire the same night if they won the finals || Do you think if he makes it to the 2027-2028 range he’ll base his retirement on Bryce’s status? His dream was to play with Bronny but to play with both sons? I’m sure he’d love that even more. Wouldn’t be surprised to see a team take Bryce too, even if he’s not NBA ready 😅 || I believe the CBA is up after the 2027 season.  I wouldn’t expect LeBron, KD, Steph to make it through that summer (and potential lockout).  It’ll potentially be 1999 part 2 (in terms of a total shift in era). || “This fuckery will be over soon”…. Just wait lol"
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-03-04,nbadiscussion,1j4i9dx,LeBron James Deserves MVP Over SGA & Jokic (Here's Why),"We are 75% through the regular season, the MVP race is heating up, and while Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Nikola Jokic are rightfully getting a lot of attention, I'm here to make the case for King James - Hallowed be his name. Yes, LeBron is 40 years old, but he's not just coasting – he's putting up a season worthy of MVP consideration, and here's why:

**LeBron is defying Father Time (again!):** Over his last 30 games, he's averaging 26.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 8.2 assists per game. Those are elite numbers for any player, let alone someone with two decades of mileage. He's also shooting efficiently, at 54.7% from the field and 43% from three. And get this: since Luka Dončić joined the Lakers, he's been even better, averaging 28 points and 10.1 rebounds per game!

**Elevating a Flawed Roster:** Let's be real, the Lakers supporting cast was considered weak before Luka arrived. Even now, many consider the team poorly constructed. Despite this, LeBron has kept them competitive in the loaded West. He's the leader of this team, guiding them through inconsistencies and making his teammates better.

**The Three-Way Race (Last 30 Games):**

Here's how LeBron stacks up against the other frontrunners over their last 30 games:

* **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander:** SGA is having an incredible season, leading the league in scoring. Over his last 30, he's averaging 34.7 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 6.5 assists. While his scoring is higher than LeBron's, LeBron edges him out in rebounds and assists while playing with a weaker supporting cast.
* **Nikola Jokic:** The Joker is a triple-double machine. In his last 30 games, he's averaging 26.4 points, 12.1 rebounds, and 11.5 assists. While Jokic leads in rebounds and assists, LeBron is scoring at a similar clip while demonstrating greater leadership and impact on a less balanced team.

**LeBron is making history.** No one in NBA history has ever performed at this level at 40 years old. Karl Malone won MVP at 35, and LeBron is exceeding those numbers. This is unprecedented territory. He already made history last year by becoming the oldest player to win any kind of MVP award when he won the inaugural In-Season Tournament MVP. A regular season MVP would be another legendary milestone.

**Conclusion**

LeBron James is proving that age is just a number. He's not just playing well for a 40-year-old; he's playing at an MVP level, carrying a flawed Lakers team and putting up historic numbers. While SGA and Jokic are having fantastic seasons, LeBron's performance, leadership, and the sheer defiance of his age make him a truly deserving candidate for the 2024-25 MVP award. His stats and greater win-share over the last 30 games prove it:

LeBrons been amazing but let’s be real || If LeBron played the way he currently is all season I'd agree.

No argument for him over SGA or Jokic with only a month and a half of him playing at this level || Being 40 doesn’t make him the mvp. He is simply not as good as Jokic or SGA. Giannis or Tatum too. He’s 5th at best || This is a terrible take. By your logic, if LeBron played until 50, and averaged 10, 5, and 5, should he win MVP then too, because ""holy shit no one has ever played like this at ***50***""? || If he played like this all season then yeah, but he only playing like this because Luka is on the team now || Feels like a Lebron glazing post lmao. Many thing you mention really had nothing to do with MVP and you credit him everything while ignoring AD starting his year as MVP candidate.

Lebron defying father time, perfoming like that at 40...blah blah has nothing to do with MVP voting, and he is not even the clear best player in that team before the trade, AD were providing DPOY calibre defense while sharing the offensive load, iirc he was among the top MVP leader until they lose to Denvers. 

Also 27/8/8 is not better than what Shai and Jokic is providing lol, not close. I will happily take 34.6 ppg on great efficiency and great defense and triple double monster on all time great efficiency over whatever Lebron is doing right now every days of the week || I love bron, but he’s just not deserving this year, I do think he deserves first team though. || Just Insane, I guess just throw out the numbers & team records. 

Who cares how old LeBron is. MVP comes down to who had the best overall stats plus your team's record.

Jokic is averaging a Triple Double as a Center, Mind Blowing because he's not even trying to get them, it just happens in the flow of the game.

SGA is the leading scorer on the Best team in the Western Conference which is also the Best Defensive team in the league. 

MVP's aren't Lifetime achievement awards. This isn't the Oscars || It's not the ""most valuable player when corrected for age"" award.

I am firmly in the camp of thinking that LeBron should have more mvps than he does and I still think you're making a terrible argument. 

If it were actually an individual award based solely on this season Jokic would win easily. Since it's a media based narrative driven award that for some reason gives you a bonus for playing with better teammates (resulting in more team wins) and Jokic already has multiple mvps and voters are ""fatigued"" it's close and SGA might win.

The way the Lakers are playing LeBron still has a shot at finals mvp, but there's no reasonable argument for him to win mvp this year. || Lmfaoooo lakers are only winning now cause of Luka. LeBron off ball and less strain on him. He has no chance of winning over SGA or joker || Lebron is playing like a top 5 player right now. Not just for the last X weeks, but for the season. Which is astonishing, honestly. He is 4th in the league in VORP and PER as well as 7th in BPM. But he has no statistical argument for MVP with how insane Shai and Jokic have been. They are both a tier above the competition. 


I hope Bron gets 1st team honors, but it would be pretty insulting to give him MVP unless things change dramatically down the stretch.  || AD led the Lakers in Estimated Wins until 2 games ago lol.  Also take a drink every time OP says ""last 30 games"". 

*Warning: do not play the LeMVP Drinking Game while operating heavy machinery.* || I do not think that his age should have an impact on him getting an MVP, it is impressive what he is doing at that age but it shouldn't be a factor. || SGA is playing absolutely bananas right now, it's his to lose. His numbers are bananas, his team is #1, Chet has barely played, and JDub is not as good as he was last season. || Say, how exactly does Lebron have  better leadership and impact compared to Jokic? What did you use to measure it? || I agree. Also, LeBron doing this at 40 shouldn’t be a factor for MVP discussions, his age makes his performance more impressive for sure, but not more valuable

Edit: Just to clarify, I said *shouldn’t*, I understand that the MVP is a narrative award but it *shouldn’t* be || tatum is a convo, but i’d still pick tatum i think. doesn’t really sniff the others even though he is playing out of his mind || Tatum should not even be in the conversation. Zero consistency plus team under performing || lol he’s better than sga, if you’re saying you’d rather have sga for a playoff series than bron you’re out of your mind || I think the idea is more so ""If you average MVP-caliber box score stats and you do something groundbreaking, you automatically enter the MVP conversation,"" probably meaning Top 5-ish. || He started playing like this since AD’s been gone/out. But I agree, lebrons early season really killed his chances. || First Team at 40 years old would be one of the wildest things ever || Narrative is a big deal. But his numbers and even record isn’t good enough either way || In a perfect world, yeah. But narrative does play a part. If it didn't, there's no way Rose wins that 2011 MVP, unless the voters really just don't understand that the Bulls hung their hat on defense and Rose played the Iverson role, keeping a team of elite defenders afloat offensively. Same with Westbrook averaging a triple-double.

LeBron's longevity narrative isn't enough to get him the MVP this year, but the voting process isn't completely free of human emotion and bias. || Eh, they have made exceptions for accomplishing out of the ordinary things, Westbrook’s first triple double season was awarded specifically because that stat line hadn’t been seen as a recent example.

It is hardly ever given to the actual most valuable player.

That being said, I didn’t see how it should be given to anyone other than Jokic this year, he is top 3 in points, assists, rebounds, and steals, shooting at an insane fg% including 44% from 3, with an astronomical PER.

Shari is the only other person with a case. 

But again, I think mvp is more about narratives now so it wouldn’t be out of the question that Lebron doing what he is at 40 could win it. || Nobody besides the top 3 are “in the conversation” but he’s a solid 4th || That's like not the criteria for MVP at all dude || MVP isn’t “who would you want in a hypothetical playoff series that hasn’t happened” it’s about who played the best in the 2024-2025 season || Nah I take Shai over him. The recent seasons has shown Lebron is not the ""if I have to take one player for a playoffs series"" Lebron anymore. He missed the playoffs, cant do anything stop Denvers even when AD playing like the best player in the world and got gentle swept back to back. He is nowhere the Final appearance monster he used to be whereas Shai is entering his prime, providing better scoring and way better defense. || That's still a stupid argument. || Rose won because he had the higher seed with less top-level help. LeBron wasn't even second. || If narratives dictate this year's MVP voting, it'll go to Shai. The media loves for a new face to come in and ""steal"" the MVP from a perennial front-runner like Jokic || Luka is much better than Tatum. Only delusional Celtics fans think otherwise || It's been a thing, though. The Thunder went 47-35 in 2017, and the one constant we've almost always seen is that you have to be roughly a Top 3 team in your conference at worst to be considered for MVP.

The Thunder were ***6th*** that year, but Westbrook got a pass because he did the unthinkable. || Rose's team won because of their defense. They were 11th offensively, which is admittedly great for a one-man show on offense, but their defense was by far their engine.

Dwight had a case for MVP that year tbh. The voters may have been hesitant to give it to LeBron because he was such a villain, idk || Possible, the other narrative would be Joker getting his 4th and tying Lebron. I spoke too dismissively of Shia’s chances, especially when considering records. Joker’s numbers are just so crazy across the board. I think most of it will come down to how they both play the rest of the season. || Luka is not qualified to receive MVP votes || Rose's one-man offence is what enabled them to field so many defence-first roleplayers. It's like Iverson's MVP (which you may not agree with either).

Dwight was a fine choice of runner-up. The voters didn't give it to LeBron because he underperformed on a superteam, not because they disliked him. || > Rose's one-man offence is what enabled them to field so many defence-first roleplayers. It's like Iverson's MVP (which you may not agree with either).

Dwight was a one-man defense though, and he was also a major factor on offense, whereas Rose presumably had relatively little impact defensively.

When you think about LeBron winning the prior two MVPs, being a one-man offense and leading the Cavs to 61 and 66 wins without a defense that at least bordered on all-time great statistically (Chicago had a -7 Net DRTG in 2011), Rose's MVP just looks weak in comparison.

So many players before and since have been unarguably better than Rose offensively, and led their teams to similar regular-season success without a defense as good as the 2011 Bulls'. || > The voters didn't give it to LeBron because he underperformed on a superteam, not because they disliked him.

If 27-7-7 on 59% TS, 58 wins in his first year with an entirely new system and teammates, while also getting more First Team votes than the actual MVP is underperforming, that's just voter fatigue.

Whether or not we expect more from LeBron personally doesn't change the fact that there is an easy argument that he had a better 2011 than Rose. And yes, LeBron had better offensive weapons, but Rose had far better defensive weapons, and Rose wasn't the two-way player LeBron was. || Rose had a larger impact on offence than Nash's 2nd MVP (which you probably disagree with too). Dwight was 10 wins behind, a big margin to overcome.

What I'm hearing here is winning 60+ games without another allstar is a great recipe for MVP. In fact I'm struggling to think of any who didn't. ('09 Cavs had a -6 defence btw). || I'd love to say unanimous 1st team is proof the voters didn't hate LeBron and were just drawing a distinction between best and most valuable.

But it was one voter who put Rose 2nd team. Doesn't mean anything. Not even the same position.

Maybe they voted for the guard who put up 26/6/6 on 58% TS on a 58-win team instead... || > What I'm hearing here is winning 60+ games without another allstar is a great recipe for MVP. In fact I'm struggling to think of any who didn't. ('09 Cavs had a -6 defence btw).

On paper, that doesn't sound like terrible logic. But when your team is dominant only on the side of the ball you *don't* contribute to, I fail to see how that player can be MVP. We've seen comparable floor-raisers who didn't get that same MVP consideration, because they didn't have an elite defense to get their team into the top of the league standings.

At least when Nash won it, the Suns were undoubtedly carried overall by the side of the ball he dominated. 

It gets murky because there's no one player on 2011 Chicago who you could say had the same impact on defense that Rose had on offense. I assume Noah was their anchor, but I can't remember for sure.

It's hard to even make a comparison, because there probably aren't any all-time great offenses that did things by committee and didn't have one person who was the clear engine on that side of the ball.

There's no case of a great, but not legendarily so, defensive player who single-handedly kept a team afloat on defense so they could field a team of great offensive players around him, with their offense being far greater than their defense, but not having a single standout offensive player. The closest I can think of is Tyson Chandler on the 2011 Mavs, but even then Dirk was still Dirk.

It's kind of unfair when you think about it, because pretty much no DPOY would ever get the award if his team was just above average defensively (Wemby probably would have been the first ever to do it this year), but MVPs who only contribute on offense can win it on teams that aren't even Top 10 in ORTG. || > I'd love to say unanimous 1st team is proof the voters didn't hate LeBron and were just drawing a distinction between best and most valuable.

That's honestly a fair point. || It's an interesting philosophical question. I'd say turning an average team into a great one is MVP-worthy regardless of which side of the ball the contribution is on.  Nash also had much more offensive support. I'd be curious to hear about these other floor-raisers you refer to. The quintessential example is Iverson.

In general it's easier for a single player to carry on offence than defence. I'd say the Gobert Jazz are closer to what you're looking for, but Donovan probably disqualifies them. Looking back much further, Russell's Celtics were (incorrectly) perceived that way in their time, which didn't stop him from winning 5 MVPs. || > I'd say turning an average team into a great one is MVP-worthy regardless of which side of the ball the contribution is on.

But we've seen plenty of elite defensive teams be great overall even without a floor-raiser on offense. Ben Wallace's Pistons (18th in ORTG in 2004, 17th in 2005), Russell's Celtics (historically bad offensively throughout almost his entire career), even a team like the 79 Sonics (1st in DRTG, 14th of 22 in ORTG). So a player like Rose is not a prerequisite for a team to win when their defense is that good.

> Nash also had much more offensive support.

Undoubtedly, but part of winning MVP is typically proving that if you are the center of your team's offense/defense, you can raise your team's ceiling with the right pieces. That's almost always the case. The only floor raisers as opposed to ceiling raisers I can think of who won MVP are Rose, Westbrook, and like you said, Iverson.

We typically require MVPs to prove that they can be ceiling raisers with great teammates, instead of giving them the benefit of the doubt that they WOULD be ceiling raisers, but they didn't have good enough pieces around them, like Rose, Westbrook, or Iverson. Voters made an exception for Russ because averaging a triple-double blew everyone's minds. They made an exception for Iverson and Rose because they falsely attributed their teams' high win totals to their contribution on offense.

Other floor raisers who didn't have the benefit of great defense that come to mind are T-Mac in Orlando, Vince Carter in Toronto, Bernard King on the mid 80s Knicks, maybe even someone like Kyrie, etc.

Even someone like Kobe in 06. If the Lakers' defense had been elite, they'd have obviously won way more games. The only difference between 06 Kobe and 2011 Rose (besides the fact that Kobe was way better) is that Rose had an elite defense behind him, whereas the Lakers had to win their meager 45 games purely on the back of Kobe's offense. Rose without that elite defense turns into a poor man's 06 Kobe and the Bulls probably win less than 50 games.

> Looking back much further, Russell's Celtics were (incorrectly) perceived that way in their time, which didn't stop him from winning 5 MVPs.

MVPs were voted by the players at that time IIRC, and everyone knew from personal experience how much of an absolute one-man army Russell was on defense. And I don't think it's much of a stretch to say that Gobert and especially Russell brought much more value defensively than Rose brought offensively in 2011. || The same player will provide different value in different situations, so part of MVP is luck of the draw. I don't think that takes anything away from such winners.

Playoffs notwithstanding, I'd hesitate to say the 54-win Pistons (let alone the 52-win Sonics) are great teams while the 62-win Bulls are not. I don't think voters were under any illusions that the Bulls and Sixers were great offences. They gave Mutombo DPOY and Thibs COTY.

As for the other players, King was an MVP runner-up, T-Mac and Vince could've won in the right circumstances and obviously Kobe did. On the flipside, Gobert and Mitchell weren't going to win on the same team; nor Billups/Wallace. It would've taken 2014 Noah to steal Rose's sunshine - as indeed Wade did to LeBron."
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-03-08,nbadiscussion,1j765cg,The current No. 6 Seeds in both conferences will be dangerous opponents in the first round of the playoffs - Warriors/Pistons,"#DET vs GSW

Last night, while the Lakers and Celtics were on ABC primetime, there was another game in Golden State that was more competitive and had an intense playoff feel with frequent lead changes.

Both the Pistons and Warriors have been playing phenomenal basketball in recent weeks, steadily climbing up the standings.

#Pistons’ Current Matchup

The No. 6 seed in the East led by all star Cade Cunningham would face the No. 3 Knicks. Even with a healthy Jalen Brunson (recently injured his ankle), the Pistons could definitely upset the Knicks (already defeated New York twice at the garden).

#Warriors’ Current Matchup

The No. 6 seed in the West led by the recent member of the 25K club, Steph Curry, would face the No. 3 Lakers. Even with a healthy LeBron James (recently injured his groin), the Warriors could definitely upset the Lakers (especially after acquiring Jimmy Butler; 11-1 in the lineup).

#Avoiding No. 3

This could be the difference between advancing and elimination. The Lakers in particular may see a better matchup with the Grizzlies/Rockets than the Warriors.

The Knicks would have to go on a significant losing streak to not be the 3 seed. The Pistons may go up in seeding to the 4th or 5th seed (Knicks would be in the clear).

#Injuries

Within the last 72 hours, there have been major injuries that will affect how the rest of the season goes for these particular seeds. Nevertheless, the Warriors and Pistons are 2 teams that will not be easy matchups in Round 1 of the postseason.",283,72,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j765cg/the_current_no_6_seeds_in_both_conferences_will/,2025-03-09 07:59:47,"Warriors are much more dangerous because they e been there and have championship DNA. 

The Pistons are a tough out but they are very young. || The Pistons are young and talented, but they also have zero playoff experience. That usually results in an early exit regardless. And if a team did want to dodge the Pistons, they’d face the Pacers or Bucks, who I’d be a lot more worried about. || The Warriors have Steph and the pedigree to be taken seriously. I don't think any serious team is worried about the positions, but they've had a great year and Cade might be all-nba. || Non ""contenders"" you don't want to see in round 1:

Warriors 
Bucks 
Clippers
Suns

High ceilings low floor teams basically. Any of these teams if they are playing well can upset a round 1 matchup. || People are underrating the pistons vets, they might not be elite players but THJ, Beasley, and Tobias are all rotational players and have plenty of playoff experience || The Pistons have been playing great but lets not act like they weren't the worst team in the league last season. Making the playoffs will be a huge success for them but the Knicks are clearly a better team.   
Detroit won on Dec.8 120-111 with Sims as the starting center and KAT as a DNP. Granted on Jan 14. Piston beat the Knicks at home by 5 points, but the Knicks blew out Detroit by 30 points on Nov 1st.  
With Kat and Mitch back for a 7 game series Pistons might sneak a game but nothing more. || I personally would not be worried for OKC or CLE with those matchups in the first round. || Nobody should want to play either of those teams. The Dubs are the hottest team in the league since the Jimmy trade, despite most of their games being on the road. And they’ve done this without Kuminga, who should be coming back from an ankle any day now. And they have Steph…and playoff Jimmy. Plus Draymond will kick you in the balls. Literally. 

The Pistons are a completely different team over the last 20 games. Cade is playing at an all-NBA level, Beasley can’t seem to miss (42% on 9.2 threes per game!), and Ausar is borderline all defense. They’re young, sure, but I like their chances against the Knicks. || You clearly haven’t watched JB Bickerstaff try to run an offense in the playoffs || The ""Pistons have zero playoff experience"" is such a BS trope.  They have over 200 games of playoff experience in their rotation between Tobias Harris, Tim Hardaway, Malik Beasley, and Dennis Schroeder.  Their coaching staff is led by a HC who has led teams to the playoffs, and they have an experienced assistant staff.  Are they AS EXPERIENCED with their playmaker Cade and HC?  No, definitely not.  But this isn't some team that's going to get to the postseason and lay down because the lights are too bright.  Have you seen how Detroit plays this season?  They scrap with everyone.  They even tried to fight Steph Curry.  I mean this with all due respect, but Detroit is almost too stupid to realize they shouldn't be as competitive as they are.

I think they beat Indy in a series and give hell to NY.  Milwaukee would be tough. || I don’t think people realize how different the basketball games are in the playoffs (far higher % half court sets vs. transition)

Or account for how “caught up in the moment” players get. Especially the ones who haven’t been there before, or gone as deep

I don’t think the pistons get more than a game on the Knicks if everyone’s healthy

Warriors for sure can beat the rockets or grizzlies, rockets more so. I’d favor them in either matchup but nuggets or lakers would both beat gsw in 5/6

Grizzlies far deeper than gsw but many of their young players make dumb mistakes, and Ja been throwing temper tantrums when he doesn’t get calls throwing himself into dudes, which you tend not to get more of in the playoffs || The Pistons won't. It's a jbb team. He won't make adjustments and try to brute force it. || Warriors are not doing anything in the postseason. They’re too small and reliant on Steph to shoot lights out every game. || [removed] || Agreed.
Most young core never been in a competative team.

As a pistons fan, i love this team, they might win a playoff game or two, but that's all. || Also, the Warriors are much better than their record. Since adding Butler, they've looked like one of the best teams in the West. || With the Brunson injury it may be the bucks the pistons end up playing! || Suns defense is beyond awful, they are not beating a 1/2 seed.

Bucks will prob be 4th so no top team can see them in the 1st round.

Clippers with Norm can be a tough out.

Warriors if they play Hoston/Memphis sure, the other top teams should beat them. || Suns aren’t getting out of the playin || You saying that actually convinced me less than before I read this. If you’re relying on the veteran leadership of THJ Beasley and Tobias, you aren’t doing shit. What have those 3 ever done in the playoffs. || Nov 1st pistons were a VERY different team, guys made jumps, Schroeder and Ausar changed a lot for this team || Agree that that trope is often trotted out more than it needs to be, as a Thunder fan I know that for sure. But I suppose one could argue that the lack of playoff experience together could be a little bit of a factor. Given the choice between those guys having independent playoff experience or playoff experience as a unit, you’d definitely take the latter. But I suppose the bit that’s up for debate is whether the benefit would be massive or negligible. I suppose it’s not really a question that can be answered as only one outcome can come true, but it’s something to think about. 

Then again, the unit has looked good this regular season, so maybe that translates to the playoffs. I just wonder if it’s going to be a bit of a roadblock for these guys who don’t know what effect, say, getting clamped by the same team for the first two games might have on their teammate and whether they can trust them to bounce back in the following games. 

I don’t know, I’m yapping about hypotheticals so I probably sound like a crackpot, but maybe you can see what I’m getting at. || As a Cavs fan who watched a JB team the past few years, he's definitely good at laying foundation for good culture and raising a teams potential floor. But you are right, he's not the guy to make adjustments and pull different levers in order to push a team to a top level || You haven't watched them post Butler trade || That matters against the Nuggets, but who else is really going to exploit that? || How is that narrative any different than 2023? 

I think if they can get the right seeding, they can win a 1st round against the likes of Memphis/Houston/Sacramento. All depends on the matchup. || How many times have I heard that now? || Remindme! [50 Days] || Depends on how serious Brunsons injury is tbh. If hes out I think the pistons can beat the knicks. Same with giannis and the bucks of course. || As a Pistons fan I’m hoping the series goes 7 games, but I don’t expect them to win a series. || True! The 3 seed is not at all locked in yet. || Bucks have the hardest SOS of the current 4-6 spots. I think Pacers end up in 4 (easiest SOS) and the 5/6 spots are decided by the final two games of the season (Bucks and Pistons end the season with two games against each other) || We’ll have a much clearer picture after the Bucks and Pacers play each other twice this week, but the Bucks have the hardest remaining schedule in the east, according to Tankathon, and the 4-6 spots are a virtual tie || They’re not relying on them for production, those guys are the leaders of the team tho other than Cade and them having that experience in the playoffs is definitely helpful, Tobias and Beasley are both having great seasons too especially Beasley || Likewise Nov 1st Knicks didn't have Mitch Rob || How many playoff teams did they beat? They’re not getting past OKC, LAL, Nuggets in the west. || [removed] || Because the west is way stronger now.

|-|-|-|-| || Remindme! [69 Days] || Wishful thinking, IMO.

Pistons have like 6 games lost at the buzzer. They won too, but they still need to know how to close games like that.

And in playoff game you need this quality || Sure, Detroit isn't getting past Boston or Cleveland either but they'll be a tough out. That's the reason for the post. || They beat OKC a couple times funnily.

Not sure if it was post butler trade though || Imagine still thinking the nuggets are better than the post trade warriors🤡 most have warriors as 3rd best team in the west over nuggets, just look at the odds in all sports betting. And the thunder were #1 seed last year too but was a 2nd round exit, and they lost to the warriors twice before the deadline when they were trash. Realistically the lakers or warriors are coming out the west if everyone stays healthy. Lebron and Steph needs to rest some games || Most of those were earlier on in the season, tbf. They’ve become much more capable of closing games the last few months. Right now they’re navigating a change in opposing game plans that will be interesting to see how they manage. Ausar is a primary focus of opponents offensive schemes and Beasley is getting a lot more attention by opponents defensive schemes, as a couple examples. They’ve got time to take another step still, will be interesting to see if they can do it

SOS-wise, they could easily be in the 4th or 5th spot a week or two from now. Pacers have an easier go, but they face the Bucks twice in that run. Matchup is going to be pretty key in the playoffs. They _could_ sneak a series, but I’ll be happy with a win or two as well

Edit: autocorrect miscorrected || I think they were pre Butler. One of those games was the game Chet hurt his hip which made their path to winning that game a bit easier (but they were kinda winning the whole way through the game), but that was definitely pretty early in the season. || Playoffs is different though.
Let’s see anyway.
They’ll be fun to watch regardless. || go back to twitter. || Exactly, and there’s 3 guys there who have multiple playoff experience and 2 guys who led their teams to finals multiple times. The first one led his with 4 championships, and the other led his team with a bunch of g-league players and upset a 1 seed just 2 seasons ago. Playoffs is totally different indeed. || I agree, but I think this concept leans more in favor of the team full of vets who have won multiple championships than the young teams who have never made a conference finals || Exactly. Playoffs are different. Okc is the best regular season team but will most likely a 2nd round exit again || Mad at reality 🥱 ok delusional || GSW fans are delusional, same way you were after starting 12-3 beating bad teams.

In the Butler run your one win against a solid team is Detroit.

Their schedule picks up a bit so the upcoming games will tell more about the Warriors, saying they are contenders now is a joke. || lol stfu Okc are regular season frauds like last year and the majority has the post trade warriors> nuggets. Look at power rankings and sports betting 🥱 cry || \> lol stfu 

you really have to go back to twitter.

OKC will bent you. || Okc lost to the warriors twice before the trade 🤢2nd round exit just like last year || Warriors are going to be the 2nd round exits (at best) || And the Timberwolves lost 4-0 to the Suns last year in the regular season and then erased them in the playoffs.

Do you not realize how stupid of an argument this is ?

And talking when you got blown out in the play ins is crazy. || OKC** regular season ass team and Denver** || I’ll be here for the groveling when the Warriors eventually get eliminated by one of those two teams || OKC are a regular season team based off what? A season and a half? There’s only been one championship won since we became a contender, so by your logic are the Celtics the only legit chance at a ring? || Don’t know ball if you actually think that 🤡
OKC lost to the warriors twice without Jimmy. And ever since the trade deadline it’s been warriors>nuggets, check nba power rankings and sports betting apps. Argue with the world 🥱 || Thanks for confirming you don’t know ball and just look at standings all day 🤣"
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-04-03,nbadiscussion,1jrdwn9,2024-25 All-NBA Teams Based on Average Ranking Across 8 Popular Advanced Metrics,"I was curious as to find a way to compile multiple advanced metrics to see if any consensus could be derived about the All-NBA teams this season. I am no mathematician and I do not know much about statistics, so I just decided to take some time and find the answer to the easiest question:

*What is the average rank for each All-NBA eligible player across multiple popular advanced metrics this season?*

This was more for my personal curiosity. I do not claim that this method actually has any validity or importance, but I did the work so I thought I would share.

**METHOD:**

*stats collected on 4/3*

To do this I referenced the 8 following advanced metrics that I see commonly used:

EPM, EW, LEBRON WAR(LW), RAPTOR WAR(RW), DARKO DPM(DPM), PER, WS, and VORP

I decided to include both EPM and EW because I think EPM is the best advanced metric so I wanted to give it some extra weight.

In order to compile the list of players best deserving of All-NBA recognition, I first went through each advanced metric for this season and gave each player a tally for an appearance in the top 20 in each of the stats.

I ended up with a list of 23 players who appeared in the top 20 in >3 out of the 8 stats, who are also likely to meet the 65 games played requirement. I had a few players that surprised me, but generally speaking it aligned with my preconceived idea of who was in contention for All-NBA recognition so I decided to roll with it. The only notable omission was Cade Cunningham who appeared in the top 20 in only 2 out of the 8 advanced metrics. Due to his narrative and likelihood of achieving All-NBA recognition, I included him.

Here are the 24 players:

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

Nikola Jokic

Giannis Antetokounmpo (Likely)

Jayson Tatum

Evan Mobley

Donovan Mitchell

Tyrese Haliburton

Ivica Zubac

Stephen Curry (Likely)

Darius Garland

Derrick White

Jarret Allen

Anthony Edwards

Karl-Anthony Towns

Domantas Sabonis (Likely)

Alperen Sengun

James Harden

Jalen Williams

Josh Hart

LeBron James

Tyler Herro

Jaren Jackson Jr.

Jalen Brunson (Likely)

Cade Cunningham

In the following table, I list each player with each of their respective RANKS in each advanced metric. This is not the metric itself, it is just the RANK in which their metric lies in comparison to their peers. 14 in the table means the 14th best number in the league for that respective stat.

At the end of the table, I include two averages. The first average is their average rank across all 8 advanced metrics. The second average (AVG(IMP)) is their average rank across the 5 all around impact metrics (EPM, EW, RAPTOR WAR, LEBRON WAR, and DARKO DPM). I believe these metrics to be different in kind to the others, so I wanted to see their averages separately.

**NOTES**

\-Haliburton being so loved by advanced metrics definitely surprised me given the narrative about him earlier this season. I would be curious to see his metrics if he can put together a full season of consistent play. Advanced metrics understandably love you if you push pace, generate great looks, and rarely turn the ball over.

\-Derrick White being so beloved by advanced metrics was not necessarily surprising, but the fact that it was enough to rank top 15 in this group of players is impressive. He is the epitome of a winning player.

\-While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated. I believe he deserves a lot more love for his performance this season(DPOY anyone?).

\-LeBron, JJJ, Brunson, and Cade not ranking well is definitely not what I expected going into this. Most of the conversation around these players land them in Second Team at worst and I have even heard arguments around these players to claim the 5th First Team spot.

This likely means nothing to most people, but there may be a few sickos who find this interesting.",290,44,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jrdwn9/202425_allnba_teams_based_on_average_ranking/,2025-04-04 10:56:58,"I have long thought Zubac criminally underrated but this HAS to be the most surprising result.  (Looking to see how EW calculated…) || Man Zubac is awesome, eye test tells me he's a great center -- but I still think there is some black box of these stats where they are giving what a center does more weight than other positions. 

Halli is officially super underrated, and Tatum/White, way more than Brown, Jrue, KP, etc. etc. etc. are why Cs had another dominant regular season. (Does your measure like Kornet more than JB? I bet it does.) || [deleted] || Yo this is great. I've idly thought about doing this but was always too lazy, so thanks for the effortpost. I expected LeBron to make 3rd team and also expected Jokic to edge out SGA so that's 2 things I got wrong there. Also hot damn Curry is balling out at 37... || 4 Cavaliers in the mix for All NBA here is surprising. They've been dominant of course but 27% of All NBA players being from the same team is wild. (At least in your AVG(IMP) rankings)
  
**Edited** to mention their extremely great health this season has a lot to do with it as they're all eligible for these honors. || I did that a while back and was really surprised how each metrics have their clear bias baked in yet top 4, r guys seem to be all unanimous. Like EPM favors offensive usage, LEBRON favors players that fit well into winning teams, DARKO really favors establish stats, etc. but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context. These metrics are really helpful to find out underrated role players, but for stars, they can be extremely misleading. || It’s crazy that the Cavs best player isn’t even one of the 4 in this analysis  || Very interesting perspective, thank you for sharing!

Zubac is a beast || Interesting stuff. Thanks for gathering this data and breaking it all down. Unfortunately, I think you're right that due to media narrative, there is no chance Brunson and LeBron get left off, and it's likely that Cade and JJJ will make it. Although those guys have all had very good seasons so it's not like it will be a travesty for any one of them to get the nod.

Zubac has almost no chance, as deserving as he is (I've been very impressed with him in the few clippers games I've watched this year) and White and Allen will likely miss the cut. I'd love to see Allen make it. The guy is such a great two way player and he's so unselfish on offense. He really makes the Cavs a much better team. || Jarrett Allen and Ivica Zubac ranking #3 and #4 in win shares is an indictment of that statistic.

> While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated.

I agree with the first part of your statement. But given that reality, why are you then trying to use these insignificant statistics to draw conclusions?

Zubac and Allen have roles to play and they play them well, but role players don't deserve to be ranked ahead of guys like Brunson or Cunningham who have far more difficult burdens to carry. || Why would you base it off metrics nobody uses?

Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil.  They’re useless.  

Obviously this isn’t how the teams are selected.  

Harden hasn’t made an all nba team in 5 years and he’s not going to make one over LeBron, who was the February player of the month and 5th on mvp ladder. || [removed] || Ultimately, the players are very close in a lot of these metrics so one good game or bad game down the stretch could vastly change the calculus for this analysis. 

  
For example, Ant had a good game last night and EW updated so now Ant is up from #10 all the way to #5. This alone would likely push Ant firmly into second team if I were to re run the analysis. But as of 4/3, these were the rankings. || Before Kawhi started playing like Kawhi, I thought Zubac was easily the most important Clipper. And for a team that was projected to be a lottery team to have a shot at 50-wins, that's Hella impressive || PER notoriously overweighs rebounding, so bigs pretty much always have higher PER than guards of similar quality. TBH it's a very flawed advanced stat that shouldnt be included in any analysis including this one imo. || The hate towards him was crazy. The people that were saying that haven't actually watched him play in a meaningful amount. He is the best pure creator in the league, hands down. His three point shooting, while streaky at times, is upper echelon. His defense is improving significantly as he gets more experience. He has moved to being a solidly average defender, when he was often a genuine liability in the past.

He still catches hate from people who like to make similar arguments against him that people do for John Stockton. It's baffling to me that people attempt to make straight faced arguments against these players because they make a high volume of ""easy assists"". You are seriously going to hold it against a player because they are capable of coordinating an offense so effectively, that they are able to very consistently get good shooters open shots, in spots that they shoot particularly well from? That is a testament to their ability as a creator, not a detrimental attribute. || The irony about the ""one good month"" thing is that it's really one bad month that tricked people. He was All-NBA last year and will likely be again this year. He had a bad start to the year but is putting up historically efficient numbers. It's basically him and prime CP3 in terms of this combination of scoring and assist volume + efficiency. Nobody else in NBA history has done this. || It’s the same story around the current MVP debate. For a huge amount of NBA fans, box score is the only value you bring to a team. Offensive output, advanced metrics, film, team success, none of it matters compared to that box score that you can glance at for five seconds and determine how valuable a player is. || The reality is that Allen not being worthy of an all-star this year is mostly a numbers thing, getting four players in is pretty ridiculous given how much talent there is around the league. But having watched most of our games this year, I think it's debatable that he's even our fourth-best player, especially if you consider his defensive impact. He's also the type of player to be underrated by casual/occasional viewers, because he does a lot that doesn't show up on the scoreboard. || >but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context.

Do these metrics underrate these players or are you just over rating them? 

Harden, Herro, and Cade all have good advanced stats. They all carry fairly poor offences || Yes, the biggest reason for this is that none of these stats measure on-ball defensive attention drawn and the benefits that it leads to for other players on the team at the risk of deflating counting stats of the player drawing the attention.

Making open looks as the 3rd/4th option on your team and ending up with a high TS% does not make a player better than say a Cade Cunningham or Donovan Mitchell.

It’s similar to how Ayton had distinctly better advanced numbers than Luka in their rookie seasons along with strong box score numbers at incredible efficiency yet anyone watching knew he was Ayton was a play finisher role player on a fully firing suns team and Luka was the entire Mavs offence. || 2025 is certainly the year of our Lord Tyrone Jerome. || What makes Zubac a role player? He's averaging 17 and 13 playing 33 MPG while anchoring the Clippers' defense. He's contending for the most important player on the team right next to Harden and Kawhi. || > Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil. They’re useless.
> 
> 

Publicly available defensive metrics, absolutely. There's basically zero value in those.

Publicly available overall metrics are solid. The vast majority of basketball value comes from offense and we can measure most of that. It's imperfect, but it's a very good way to determine who's in the ballpark. || My understanding is a lot of these stats weigh a bunch of counting stats heavier for centers than other roles -- which is OK up to a point because maybe a center getting an assist is more valuable than a PG doing the same, but it's hard to know. PER people who know seem to generally perceive as antiquated, right? || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || As someone who doesn't watch much Indiana or Charlotte basketball,  I'm really curious how Haliburton and Ball compare now. And to a lesser extent, Ant.  
Thinking back, man, that was a really fun draft class. || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || It's so weird, he was an all-star and top-tier playmaker an entire year on the Pacers in 22-23 season. His second half of the season in 21-22, when he was traded to the Pacers, was also really really good. His shooting averages have been good his entire career. ""One good month"" people are trolls or need to have their eyes checked because all you need to do is watch 48 minutes of the Pacers and you'll see him constantly trapped and doubled _at the logo_ and instead of playing hero ball he swings it because someone will be open, whether it counts in his box score or not.

But it's no surprise, average basketball fans are really really stupid when it comes to elite playmakers. Jokic was clowned for years and now pretty much everyone recognize how incredible he is. I wonder, what is the difference between now and years before? Ring finger, that's it. || Wouldn't models that include plus/minus stats account for this? Even if you don't necessarily generate an assist or made shot, if your ""gravity"" is actually opening things for teammates and contributing to winning it will show up in the plus/minus. || Yeah i think PER is generally agreed to be the worst advanced stat. VORP, which is derived from BPM, is one of the stats that does weigh assists more for bigs (which is why Jokic's BMP/VORP are always insane). The other stats in the post I'm not familiar with their formulas though || Ball has a lot more variance as a point because he is more audacious in both his shot attempts and his passing. That means he is less efficient in his scoring and as a passer. As a scorer he makes up for some of the loss in efficiency with an increased volume of scoring compared to Tyrese but as a passer he generates fewer assists and more turnovers. At his best I think he could make another All-Star game or two but he really needs a coach that can rein in some of his wilder decision-making in terms of shot selection. Ball is a better athlete than Tyrese and should be much more dangerous in isolation but Ball is somewhat of a chucker and doesn't always press his advantages.    
    
Ant is an S-tier athlete and has the highest potential of any of the three, he was the rightful #1 pick and his ease in getting to his spots and the way his shot has developed puts him on a development curve that could see him win an MVP or two. He has insane potential with what he has shown as a pull-up shooter this year. Add that to his athleticism and give him a few thousand reps over the next few seasons and he's going to be a monster at his peak if his health permits it. He has added some playmaking and has really rounded into a shooting guard that can do everything you could want on the floor. Just needs to smooth some rough edges over time but he is already one hell of a player.        
      
Tyrese I think has outside MVP potential is he can lead the Pacers to a few 60-win seasons as a 22/12 sort of player, kind of like Nash's MVPs. He is the worst athlete of these three by a fair bit but because his strength is in how he thinks the game more than anything he could have a peak that extends into his early 30s like Nash. He's an elite decisionmaker in both quality and quickness and still has a lot of room to grow there. || Regardless of talent, you put Tyrese in that Hornets locker room 2 years ago and the entire vibe of Charolette changes. When Tyrese showed up everything changed here. He was vocal about how he wanted the team's vibes and desires to change. He wanted a friendly locker room that was ALL ABOUT WINNING. He'd never won and that was all he wanted. Every Pacer staff, player and fan will tell you the locker room vibes are immaculate and the entire culture flipped. 


Nobody should doubt Lamelos talent but if you think he'd ever do that you're missing hard. And he's 2 years younger but Rese was 22 when he showed up here with that attitude. 


Also Tyrese is the better player but that's not my point cause I do think Lamelo is very good. || No, because in such a case, all your team mates in the same rotation would get the same credit for the improved performance as you in +/- stats.  The point I am making is that there is no stat which appreciates that you are the holding the defensive attention and deserve disproportionate credit for it.

This is especially true when an offensive player is saving a player from a ghastly offensive rating to a below average one or average one and if doesn’t show up on the rankings like that. || I think most of the other stats are proprietary and their formulas aren't public! || So basically, VORP and BPM overrate unique players who play different roles than what is typically expected from that position. || > he is more audacious in both his shot attempts and his passing.

I don't think he's more audacious as a passer at all. He's far more reckless, but I think people have mistakenly conflated that with a higher ceiling/lower floor. And in reality, it's really just a lower floor.

Haliburton's highlight reel passes are right there with LaMelo's, if not exceeding them. And the gap in overall volume is *massive.* Haliburton has 14 games with more assists than LaMelo's career-high. 

People are thrown off by Haliburton because they have no frame of reference for someone regularly dishing out 12 assists with no turnovers. So they say he's passive or plays it safe. But in reality he's a far more aggressive passer and creator than just about anybody in the league. He's just an all-time great passer with incredible vision and creativity. || This is largely accurate, but i think you're slightly overrating Ball. He's a more gifted scorer than Haliburton, and he's one of the best passers in the league, but his ""audacious"" passing doesn't necessarily mean better. He takes riskier passes because he is less able to break down defenses than Haliburton. Tyrese has some of the fastest processing speeds and best minds of any point guard in the league. His passes are simple because he reads the game *exceptionally* well. NBA Academy did a breakdown last year about his potential assists generated and his conversion rate. He's basically up there with CP3 in a league of his own among guards. Trae and LaMelo are also excellent playmakers, but they're conspicuously less efficient at distributing the ball and creating advantages than Tyrese. With that said, they're both noticeably better scorers. The athleticism gap is part of it, as is health. Tyrese's back impacts his driving ability and might be the only thing that keeps him from having a very long, extended prime. LaMelo has his own health issues, though. 

All 3 players are remarkable to watch, though. It's a fun time to be a fan of flashy point guards. || >all your team mates in the same rotation would get the same credit for the improved performance as you in +/- stats.

No they don't. 

These metrics are adjusted for team mates over time. 

That's also why box score (and more) stats are incorporated into calculations so they can help to narrow that variance || Yep exactly. BPM assigns every player a ""position value"" on a spectrum between 1 - 5 (guard to big), then gives more weight to rebounds for a lower position value (guard-like players) and similarly gives more weight to assists for higher positions values (big-like players)."
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-04-03,nbadiscussion,1jqnb66,[OC] Narrowing down the true title contenders based on just 3 data points,"We are going to narrow down the teams that truly have a chance to win a title this year based on these 3 data points: Seed, Preseason Odds, All-NBA Defender. Let's break down the historical data first.

**Preseason odds**

Basketball reference has [preseason odds](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2025_preseason_odds.html) data going back to 1985. Since then, here are the ""worst"" teams to win a title:

|Year|Champion|Preseason Odds|
:-:|:-:|:-:|
|2015|Golden State Warriors|2800|
|2011|Dallas Mavericks|2000|
|2019|Toronto Raptors|1850|
|2023|Denver Nuggets|1800|
|2004|Detroit Pistons|1500|

Since 1985, 95% of NBA champions had **better than +2000 odds to win the title in the preseason**. 

Looking at just preseason odds would narrow down potential champions to these teams: Boston Celtics, New York Knicks, Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves, Oklahoma City Thunder, Dallas Mavericks, Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers.

**Playoff Seed**

When you look at [every NBA/BAA champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions) dating back to 1947, here is the breakdown by seed:

1 seed- 52 (67%)

2 seed- 16 (21%)

3 seed- 8 (10%)

4/6 seed- 2 (3%)

So 97% of all NBA champions were a **top 3 seed** with the two exceptions being the '69 Celtics and '95 Rockets. 

Looking at just the top 3 seeds would narrow down potential champions to these teams: Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics, New York Knicks, *Los Angeles Lakers*, *Denver Nuggets*, *Los Angeles Clippers*, *Memphis Grizzlies*, *Golden State Warriors*, *Minnesota Timberwolves*

*possible top 3 seed (currently within 2 wins of the 3 seed)*

**All-NBA Defender**

Last metric we are looking at is championship teams with [All-NBA defenders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Defensive_Team). Since the NBA introduced All-Defense teams in 1969, here is every championship team that did NOT have an All-NBA defender:

|Year|Champion|Best Defender|
:-:|:-:|:-:|
|2023|Denver Nuggets|Aaron Gordon|
|2016|Cleveland Cavaliers|LeBron James|
|2006|Miami Heat|Alonzo Mourning*|
|1995|Houston Rockets|Hakeem Olajuwon*|
|1981|Boston Celtics|Robert Parish|
|1978|Washington Bullets|Elvin Hayes|
|1975|Golden State Warriors|Jamaal Wilkes|

*Mourning and Olajuwon were both top 10 in DPOY voting, but missed out on All-Defense due to playing in a stacked position.* 

If we fudge the numbers a bit to say they were All-Defense players, than 91% of all **NBA champions had at least 1 All-Defense player**.

This one is a little harder to predict at this point, but looking at just the players likely to make an All-Defense team would narrow down potential champions to these teams: Golden State Warriors, Cleveland Cavaliers, Oklahoma City Thunder, Atlanta Hawks, Memphis Grizzlies, *Portland Trail Blazers*, *Houston Rockets*, *Boston Celtics*, *Minnesota Timberwolves*, *Miami Heat*, *Los Angeles Clippers*, *Milwaukee Bucks*, *New York Knicks*

*potentially have All-Defense player*

Looking at just these 3 data points (better than +2000 preseason odds, top 3 seed, 1 All-Defense player), I think the potential champions can be broken down into 4 buckets:

**Clear title favorite (meets all 3 criteria)**

Oklahoma City Thunder

**Very strong contenders (meets 2 out of 3, but possibly all 3)**

Boston Celtics, New York Knicks

**Finals contenders, but unlikely to win it all (just 2 out of 3)**

Minnesota Timberwolves, Cleveland Cavaliers, Houston Rockets

**Long shots (meets 1 out of 3, but possibly 2)**

Denver Nuggets, Milwaukee Bucks, Golden State Warriors, Memphis Grizzlies, Los Angeles Clippers",2,42,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jqnb66/oc_narrowing_down_the_true_title_contenders_based/,2025-04-03 12:40:57,"This is a great example of how data can be *misinterpreted and misused.* Which is especially obvious when the conclusion states something like 'The Knicks may meet all 3 criteria and are very strong contenders' but the Cavs are a category below that (because their success was not predicted.) Any conclusion that winds up with 'the Celtics and Knicks are equal contenders' should be reevaluating it's criteria immediately. 


Three seeds have won just 10% of the time, and 1 seeds have won *67%* of the time, yet there is no weighting given between them. You are just using a pass/fail check on being a top 3 seed. 


I'm not really sure what the point of this was.  || Using preseason odds as a metric is so funny because those are an amalgamation of like, potentially hundreds of different factors that Vegas keeps track of. It’s like saying your secret barbecue sauce is store brand barbecue sauce plus mustard and brown sugar. || Shouldn’t you use some sort of metric like defensive rating to measure defense rather than just defensive team appearances? The Bucks have several form All defensive players (including a DPOY) but are a very average defense. The Hawks also make your list but are a very below average defense, and the Magic without an All defensive player are generally a very good defense. 

I also think your use of the pre season odds is silly. Of course teams with higher odds of winning are more likely to win. That’s the whole point of odds, but preseason odds are inherently worse than the current odds because they are missing 70+ games of data. || Not to be rude, but if an analyst I worked with gave me this analysis I’d cringe. 

I think your point on all defensive players is interesting and one I hadn’t heard, but otherwise this analysis is a hot mess. It comes off as someone trying to use quantitative analysis but doesn’t quite understand it. 

That said, I appreciate the creativity and wish there were more posts like this being creative so take my upvote! || IMO, advanced stats (or data in general) is used to spot patterns and bases the patterns to speculate outcomes without the need to review every single data point (watch and analyze all games in the example of the NBA). So, when advanced stats do not fit the eye test, that is a flawed statistic. || Why would you use all defensive team vs all nba team? Are there more teams to win a title with an all defensive team talent than an all nba talent? || the number of teams that fall out of being a preseason favorite are very, very low. so you are just saying they’re favored to win by vegas. same with seeding, very rarely is a team favored to win it all if they arent a top 3 seed.

this whole post is “they’re favored by vegas to win and they have a good defender”

not too informative || Lmao the Knicks aren't very strong finals contenders no matter what 3 data points say || People are being rude for no reason. Interesting approach. Keep trying things. Keep enjoying being a fan || I appreciate the effort but I know it was BS when I saw Knicks beside the Celtics || Stop dude. You posted this in r/nba and no one bought in. Posting it here won't uncringe this. || Bruh, its egregious to expect Clippers, Nuggets, Warriors, Grizzlies to win over the Lakers, who don't even star in your list. That is how we know the data is useless. Like, Lakers are not even in Long Shots category? While holding season record against all of the above teams (I presume we are up against all four). And its not just the playoffs experience that they have, but the eye test confirms it. 

I am sorry my G, this is not very impressive. || [removed] || One thing to note about betting odds… Betting odds aren't based entirely on who the oddsmakers thinks will win; they also account for what will make the oddsmakers the most money while managing risk. For most teams this doesn't change things much. But for the most popular teams which get the most betting activity, the stated odds are often a little skewed. I.e., important to remember oddsmakers are trying to make money more than they're trying to give the best possible prediction of an outcome. 

It also seems weird to use pre-season odds when you could use end-of-season odds. Preseason odds don't account for anything that happens during the season, e.g., injuries, trades, players that don't gel, etc. End of season odds will be based on more data, including pre-season predictions. I'd be shocked if preseason odds are better predictors than end of season. || [removed] || And frankly what's the difference between a 3 seed and a 4 seed anyway you probably are on the road for 3 series anyway. || Yeah, being one of the handful of teams Vegas thinks will win (before the season even starts) isn’t too meaningful of a title. 

Now, is the NBA generally predictable enough to narrow it down to 3-4 teams in preseason? Oh 100% yes, but Vegas can’t anticipate teams like the Knicks failing to win as much as one game against a team that matters. Or teams like Cleveland who no one had any real hope for, finally clicking and being dominant. 

Also, 3 of the 5 examples given were teams that only won because the actual contenders faced massive injuries that year. 

There is some validity to the seeding and the having an All NBA defender, though. || i’m a cavs fan and i’m still a little pessimistic tbh. this team was a dark horse and got punked by the knicks a few years back. struggled with orlando last year. this year is the true test.

the playoffs are about matchups. mitchell is great but he can’t do it all himself. garland needs to deliver and there are obvious defensive holes on the perimeter that will be exploited. || Yeah this is a pretty garbage post for pretty much every point

Preseason odds are just ""was your blueprint for success obvious from the get-go"" (and Cavs probably largely got dinged on odds just because of how heavy of an ECF favorite the Celtics were)

Top-3 seeds should probably be just top 2, if anything.  This is mostly just saying ""if you're good, you're probably at the top of the conference unless something weird is happening"".

And the all-defense point is silly, is there anyone that would realistically argue that the Celtics don't have multiple guys who are all-defense caliber, even they won't happen to land on a team this year?  It's basically just saying ""it's unlikely for a complete glass cannon team to win the title"", which is pretty obvious (and silly to filter on if you have 1 player who got a specific award).

So this post basically boils down to ""if you have an obviously talented team that is decent on defense and plays well during the regular season, you should be a title contender"".  What a revelation! || Ya this forum is just a bunch of nerds trying to play basketball with stats.. the mods won’t let u have an opinion that’s not connected to a stat or analytic and these people never played basketball.

Title contention doesn’t have anything to do with metrics, but metrics can support it. An all world defender means nothing if u have a defensive liability, last year the mavs had a mvp candidate, best interior and perimeter defenders, and a big liability in luca, no matter what metrics u use, they lose because FIVE celtics can exploit that metric easily… || I actually do think there is some value to preseason odds, it just diminishes the further you go into the season. Now would I call them one of the best three predictive stats for the final, of course not. 

But it can be used beneficially. I think it’s reflection (barring any big trades) of how good your roster is on paper. I think it could be useful to compare to current finals odds to gauge the improvement of the team and how the roster actually has performed on paper. But if you see two teams with comparable current odds, I do think there could be an edge in betting on the team with the better opening odds for the season just as they likely have a deeper roster or more experienced roster.

LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-04-04,nbadiscussion,1jrdwn9,2024-25 All-NBA Teams Based on Average Ranking Across 8 Popular Advanced Metrics,"I was curious as to find a way to compile multiple advanced metrics to see if any consensus could be derived about the All-NBA teams this season. I am no mathematician and I do not know much about statistics, so I just decided to take some time and find the answer to the easiest question:

*What is the average rank for each All-NBA eligible player across multiple popular advanced metrics this season?*

This was more for my personal curiosity. I do not claim that this method actually has any validity or importance, but I did the work so I thought I would share.

**METHOD:**

*stats collected on 4/3*

To do this I referenced the 8 following advanced metrics that I see commonly used:

EPM, EW, LEBRON WAR(LW), RAPTOR WAR(RW), DARKO DPM(DPM), PER, WS, and VORP

I decided to include both EPM and EW because I think EPM is the best advanced metric so I wanted to give it some extra weight.

In order to compile the list of players best deserving of All-NBA recognition, I first went through each advanced metric for this season and gave each player a tally for an appearance in the top 20 in each of the stats.

I ended up with a list of 23 players who appeared in the top 20 in >3 out of the 8 stats, who are also likely to meet the 65 games played requirement. I had a few players that surprised me, but generally speaking it aligned with my preconceived idea of who was in contention for All-NBA recognition so I decided to roll with it. The only notable omission was Cade Cunningham who appeared in the top 20 in only 2 out of the 8 advanced metrics. Due to his narrative and likelihood of achieving All-NBA recognition, I included him.

Here are the 24 players:

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

Nikola Jokic

Giannis Antetokounmpo (Likely)

Jayson Tatum

Evan Mobley

Donovan Mitchell

Tyrese Haliburton

Ivica Zubac

Stephen Curry (Likely)

Darius Garland

Derrick White

Jarret Allen

Anthony Edwards

Karl-Anthony Towns

Domantas Sabonis (Likely)

Alperen Sengun

James Harden

Jalen Williams

Josh Hart

LeBron James

Tyler Herro

Jaren Jackson Jr.

Jalen Brunson (Likely)

Cade Cunningham

In the following table, I list each player with each of their respective RANKS in each advanced metric. This is not the metric itself, it is just the RANK in which their metric lies in comparison to their peers. 14 in the table means the 14th best number in the league for that respective stat.

At the end of the table, I include two averages. The first average is their average rank across all 8 advanced metrics. The second average (AVG(IMP)) is their average rank across the 5 all around impact metrics (EPM, EW, RAPTOR WAR, LEBRON WAR, and DARKO DPM). I believe these metrics to be different in kind to the others, so I wanted to see their averages separately.

**NOTES**

\-Haliburton being so loved by advanced metrics definitely surprised me given the narrative about him earlier this season. I would be curious to see his metrics if he can put together a full season of consistent play. Advanced metrics understandably love you if you push pace, generate great looks, and rarely turn the ball over.

\-Derrick White being so beloved by advanced metrics was not necessarily surprising, but the fact that it was enough to rank top 15 in this group of players is impressive. He is the epitome of a winning player.

\-While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated. I believe he deserves a lot more love for his performance this season(DPOY anyone?).

\-LeBron, JJJ, Brunson, and Cade not ranking well is definitely not what I expected going into this. Most of the conversation around these players land them in Second Team at worst and I have even heard arguments around these players to claim the 5th First Team spot.

This likely means nothing to most people, but there may be a few sickos who find this interesting.",293,44,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jrdwn9/202425_allnba_teams_based_on_average_ranking/,2025-04-04 10:56:58,"I have long thought Zubac criminally underrated but this HAS to be the most surprising result.  (Looking to see how EW calculated…) || Man Zubac is awesome, eye test tells me he's a great center -- but I still think there is some black box of these stats where they are giving what a center does more weight than other positions.

Like EPM favors offensive usage, LEBRON favors players that fit well into winning teams, DARKO really favors establish stats, etc. but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context. These metrics are really helpful to find out underrated role players, but for stars, they can be extremely misleading. || It’s crazy that the Cavs best player isn’t even one of the 4 in this analysis  || Very interesting perspective, thank you for sharing!

Zubac is a beast || Interesting stuff. Thanks for gathering this data and breaking it all down. Unfortunately, I think you're right that due to media narrative, there is no chance Brunson and LeBron get left off, and it's likely that Cade and JJJ will make it. Although those guys have all had very good seasons so it's not like it will be a travesty for any one of them to get the nod.

Zubac has almost no chance, as deserving as he is (I've been very impressed with him in the few clippers games I've watched this year) and White and Allen will likely miss the cut. I'd love to see Allen make it. The guy is such a great two way player and he's so unselfish on offense. He really makes the Cavs a much better team. || Jarrett Allen and Ivica Zubac ranking #3 and #4 in win shares is an indictment of that statistic.

> While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated.

I agree with the first part of your statement. But given that reality, why are you then trying to use these insignificant statistics to draw conclusions?

Zubac and Allen have roles to play and they play them well, but role players don't deserve to be ranked ahead of guys like Brunson or Cunningham who have far more difficult burdens to carry. || Why would you base it off metrics nobody uses?

Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil.  They’re useless.  

Obviously this isn’t how the teams are selected.  

Harden hasn’t made an all nba team in 5 years and he’s not going to make one over LeBron, who was the February player of the month and 5th on mvp ladder. || [removed] || Ultimately, the players are very close in a lot of these metrics so one good game or bad game down the stretch could vastly change the calculus for this analysis. 

  
For example, Ant had a good game last night and EW updated so now Ant is up from #10 all the way to #5. This alone would likely push Ant firmly into second team if I were to re run the analysis. But as of 4/3, these were the rankings. || Before Kawhi started playing like Kawhi, I thought Zubac was easily the most important Clipper. And for a team that was projected to be a lottery team to have a shot at 50-wins, that's Hella impressive || PER notoriously overweighs rebounding, so bigs pretty much always have higher PER than guards of similar quality. TBH it's a very flawed advanced stat that shouldnt be included in any analysis including this one imo. || The hate towards him was crazy. The people that were saying that haven't actually watched him play in a meaningful amount. He is the best pure creator in the league, hands down. His three point shooting, while streaky at times, is upper echelon. His defense is improving significantly as he gets more experience. He has moved to being a solidly average defender, when he was often a genuine liability in the past.

He still catches hate from people who like to make similar arguments against him that people do for John Stockton. It's baffling to me that people attempt to make straight faced arguments against these players because they make a high volume of ""easy assists"". You are seriously going to hold it against a player because they are capable of coordinating an offense so effectively, that they are able to very consistently get good shooters open shots, in spots that they shoot particularly well from? That is a testament to their ability as a creator, not a detrimental attribute. || The irony about the ""one good month"" thing is that it's really one bad month that tricked people. He was All-NBA last year and will likely be again this year. He had a bad start to the year but is putting up historically efficient numbers. It's basically him and prime CP3 in terms of this combination of scoring and assist volume + efficiency. Nobody else in NBA history has done this. || It’s the same story around the current MVP debate. For a huge amount of NBA fans, box score is the only value you bring to a team. Offensive output, advanced metrics, film, team success, none of it matters compared to that box score that you can glance at for five seconds and determine how valuable a player is. || The reality is that Allen not being worthy of an all-star this year is mostly a numbers thing, getting four players in is pretty ridiculous given how much talent there is around the league. But having watched most of our games this year, I think it's debatable that he's even our fourth-best player, especially if you consider his defensive impact. He's also the type of player to be underrated by casual/occasional viewers, because he does a lot that doesn't show up on the scoreboard. || >but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context.

Do these metrics underrate these players or are you just over rating them? 

Harden, Herro, and Cade all have good advanced stats. They all carry fairly poor offences || Yes, the biggest reason for this is that none of these stats measure on-ball defensive attention drawn and the benefits that it leads to for other players on the team at the risk of deflating counting stats of the player drawing the attention.

Making open looks as the 3rd/4th option on your team and ending up with a high TS% does not make a player better than say a Cade Cunningham or Donovan Mitchell.

It’s similar to how Ayton had distinctly better advanced numbers than Luka in their rookie seasons along with strong box score numbers at incredible efficiency yet anyone watching knew he was Ayton was a play finisher role player on a fully firing suns team and Luka was the entire Mavs offence. || 2025 is certainly the year of our Lord Tyrone Jerome. || What makes Zubac a role player? He's averaging 17 and 13 playing 33 MPG while anchoring the Clippers' defense. He's contending for the most important player on the team right next to Harden and Kawhi. || > Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil. They’re useless.
> 
> 

Publicly available defensive metrics, absolutely. There's basically zero value in those.

Publicly available overall metrics are solid. The vast majority of basketball value comes from offense and we can measure most of that. It's imperfect, but it's a very good way to determine who's in the ballpark. || My understanding is a lot of these stats weigh a bunch of counting stats heavier for centers than other roles -- which is OK up to a point because maybe a center getting an assist is more valuable than a PG doing the same, but it's hard to know. PER people who know seem to generally perceive as antiquated, right? || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || As someone who doesn't watch much Indiana or Charlotte basketball,  I'm really curious how Haliburton and Ball compare now. And to a lesser extent, Ant.  
Thinking back, man, that was a really fun draft class. || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || It's so weird, he was an all-star and top-tier playmaker an entire year on the Pacers in 22-23 season. His second half of the season in 21-22, when he was traded to the Pacers, was also really really good. His shooting averages have been good his entire career. ""One good month"" people are trolls or need to have their eyes checked because all you need to do is watch 48 minutes of the Pacers and you'll see him constantly trapped and doubled _at the logo_ and instead of playing hero ball he swings it because someone will be open, whether it counts in his box score or not.

But it's no surprise, average basketball fans are really really stupid when it comes to elite playmakers. Jokic was clowned for years and now pretty much everyone recognize how incredible he is. I wonder, what is the difference between now and years before? Ring finger, that's it. || Wouldn't models that include plus/minus stats account for this? Even if you don't necessarily generate an assist or made shot, if your ""gravity"" is actually opening things for teammates and contributing to winning it will show up in the plus/minus. || Yeah i think PER is generally agreed to be the worst advanced stat. VORP, which is derived from BPM, is one of the stats that does weigh assists more for bigs (which is why Jokic's BMP/VORP are always insane). The other stats in the post I'm not familiar with their formulas though || Ball has a lot more variance as a point because he is more audacious in both his shot attempts and his passing. That means he is less efficient in his scoring and as a passer. As a scorer he makes up for some of the loss in efficiency with an increased volume of scoring compared to Tyrese but as a passer he generates fewer assists and more turnovers. At his best I think he could make another All-Star game or two but he really needs a coach that can rein in some of his wilder decision-making in terms of shot selection. Ball is a better athlete than Tyrese and should be much more dangerous in isolation but Ball is somewhat of a chucker and doesn't always press his advantages.    
    
Ant is an S-tier athlete and has the highest potential of any of the three, he was the rightful #1 pick and his ease in getting to his spots and the way his shot has developed puts him on a development curve that could see him win an MVP or two. He has insane potential with what he has shown as a pull-up shooter this year. Add that to his athleticism and give him a few thousand reps over the next few seasons and he's going to be a monster at his peak if his health permits it. He has added some playmaking and has really rounded into a shooting guard that can do everything you could want on the floor. Just needs to smooth some rough edges over time but he is already one hell of a player.        
      
Tyrese I think has outside MVP potential is he can lead the Pacers to a few 60-win seasons as a 22/12 sort of player, kind of like Nash's MVPs. He is the worst athlete of these three by a fair bit but because his strength is in how he thinks the game more than anything he could have a peak that extends into his early 30s like Nash. He's an elite decisionmaker in both quality and quickness and still has a lot of room to grow there. || Regardless of talent, you put Tyrese in that Hornets locker room 2 years ago and the entire vibe of Charolette changes. When Tyrese showed up everything changed here. He was vocal about how he wanted the team's vibes and desires to change. He wanted a friendly locker room that was ALL ABOUT WINNING. He'd never won and that was all he wanted. Every Pacer staff, player and fan will tell you the locker room vibes are immaculate and the entire culture flipped. 


Nobody should doubt Lamelos talent but if you think he'd ever do that you're missing hard. And he's 2 years younger but Rese was 22 when he showed up here with that attitude. 


Also Tyrese is the better player but that's not my point cause I do think Lamelo is very good. || No, because in such a case, all your team mates in the same rotation would get the same credit for the improved performance as you in +/- stats.  The point I am making is that there is no stat which appreciates that you are the holding the defensive attention and deserve disproportionate credit for it.

This is especially true when an offensive player is saving a player from a ghastly offensive rating to a below average one or average one and if doesn’t show up on the rankings like that. || I think most of the other stats are proprietary and their formulas aren't public! || So basically, VORP and BPM overrate unique players who play different roles than what is typically expected from that position. || > he is more audacious in both his shot attempts and his passing.

I don't think he's more audacious as a passer at all. He's far more reckless, but I think people have mistakenly conflated that with a higher ceiling/lower floor. And in reality, it's really just a lower floor.

Haliburton's highlight reel passes are right there with LaMelo's, if not exceeding them. And the gap in overall volume is *massive.* Haliburton has 14 games with more assists than LaMelo's career-high. 

People are thrown off by Haliburton because they have no frame of reference for someone regularly dishing out 12 assists with no turnovers. So they say he's passive or plays it safe. But in reality he's a far more aggressive passer and creator than just about anybody in the league. He's just an all-time great passer with incredible vision and creativity. || This is largely accurate, but i think you're slightly overrating Ball. He's a more gifted scorer than Haliburton, and he's one of the best passers in the league, but his ""audacious"" passing doesn't necessarily mean better. He takes riskier passes because he is less able to break down defenses than Haliburton. Tyrese has some of the fastest processing speeds and best minds of any point guard in the league. His passes are simple because he reads the game *exceptionally* well. NBA Academy did a breakdown last year about his potential assists generated and his conversion rate. He's basically up there with CP3 in a league of his own among guards. Trae and LaMelo are also excellent playmakers, but they're conspicuously less efficient at distributing the ball and creating advantages than Tyrese. With that said, they're both noticeably better scorers. The athleticism gap is part of it, as is health. Tyrese's back impacts his driving ability and might be the only thing that keeps him from having a very long, extended prime. LaMelo has his own health issues, though. 

All 3 players are remarkable to watch, though. It's a fun time to be a fan of flashy point guards. || >all your team mates in the same rotation would get the same credit for the improved performance as you in +/- stats.

No they don't. 

These metrics are adjusted for team mates over time. 

That's also why box score (and more) stats are incorporated into calculations so they can help to narrow that variance || Yep exactly. BPM assigns every player a ""position value"" on a spectrum between 1 - 5 (guard to big), then gives more weight to rebounds for a lower position value (guard-like players) and similarly gives more weight to assists for higher positions values (big-like players)."
LeBron James,LeBron James,2025-04-09,nbadiscussion,1jw1eff,Do you believe a FMVP should go to the loser if he has actually been the best performing player?,"The discussion sparked by reading those annual social media comments about Iguodala not deserving FMVP and *only* holding LeBron to 35/13/9? Many comments were saying it was better to just award LeBron James the award because he was far and away the best performing player that series. Or I've seen comments saying to give it to Stephen Curry because he was the best, statistically, performing player on the winning team.  
 
So, for one, that narrative of ""holding Lebron to only 35/13/9"" is very deceiving. Going by [ESPN's stats](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2015/6/22/8814633/andre-iguodala-justifying-the-most-valuable-player-nba-finals-2015), Iguodala held LeBron James to 33% shooting when he was his primary defender. The Cavaliers often tried to switch Iguodala off but only succeeded 20% of the time meaning the Warriors were not allowing LeBron to force a switch to a smaller player.  Also by going through [more detailed stats](https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/106613/iggy-makes-lebrons-shooting-iffy), we see that Iguodala was not giving him any looks, allowing any switches and defending as best as one realistically can. I know it's also a team effort because no one man can stop any elite offensive superstar.  
  
With that said, Iguodala went on to receive 7 out of the 11 FMVP votes and LeBron received 4. Even with as well as LeBron was defended in Iguodala minutes, overall, he still did average absurd numbers and had a huge impact in a series than ended in 6. Should performances like this be applauded and rewarded despite it not leading to a win? Or should we reserve FMVP solely to a player on the winning team?",642,428,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jw1eff/do_you_believe_a_fmvp_should_go_to_the_loser_if/,2025-04-10 11:58:40,"I think if the player on the losing team is good enough, he should win.

Lebron in 2015 is the only series in my lifetime where I would have been fine with that outcome.

That being said, Iggy winning it is absurd. Steph was significantly more impactful and more productive. It was a narrative award because the warriors turned the series around when Iggy went into the starting lineup. I’m sure that helped, but the Cavs radically changed styles after losing Kyrie and the warriors were going to adjust to it anyways. || It has to go to close 7 and have a one man team vs a team like 2004 Pistons. If you take those Lebron stats and his team, and put them over there it would’ve been real hard to give FMVP to Chauncey. Or Rip, Ben or Sheed. Lebron would be getting that award i’m sure. || No. I believe the testimony of Jerry West, and he lacked words to express how inappropriate it felt. Toward his team mates. In regards to his own feelings, which are concerned with losing.

Some FMVPs are more legendary than others. Jerry West's is for the dramaturgy of that first occurrence. Repeating that mistake would be plain stupid, imho.

As for Iggy's MVP, no shade to Iggy, but the mistake was really taking it from Steph.

Last year Brown the MVP and it was somewhat ok because although Tatum is the best player in the team, the performance in the series was comparable and Tatum isn't a cornerstone like Curry was. The team has spacing, playmaking, defense, etc. Without him.

Without Curry, the playmaking was ok but ugly, but the difference in spacing was huge. It was a mistake to award an X factor instead of a cornerstone.

The level of a player is best assessed by the standard you judge him by. If you judge players by different standards, then the players whose standard is the highest should gets the award, period, unless the performance literally changes the way you see both players. An underperforming Curry was still way more instrumental to winning than an overperforming Iggy. And that's no shade to Iggy. There was a huge gap between Scalabrine and a college player. There was  a big gap between a top 80 player in the league then (what Iggy was ?) and Scalabrine (~400th ?). And again a big gap between a top 3 player (Curry) and Iggy. || [removed] || This happened just last year in the NHL. McDavid won it even though the Oilers lost the series. Obviously they're very different sports, but I don't think it's controversial at all to think the FMVP could still be on the losing side. || I get what the argument is for it, but I'm fine with restricting it to the winning team. It's kind of a similar thing to the MVP award - it almost always goes to someone from a good team. A player on a non-playoff team, for instance, will not win the award even if they had gaudy stats.

This is kind of the same thing. You could essentially ask, ""How valuable was your performance, if your team lost?"" I suppose you could argue that the team would have lost by a bigger margin, but a loss is still a loss. Having it be someone from the winning side makes sense, as it is basically saying that their contribution was essential to the win.

Jerry West is the only player to win FMVP while losing, but that was in the first year that they did the award. Since then, it's always gone to the winner. || Depends on the disparity between the best player on the winning team and the best player on the losing team, as well as the series itself

It’s easily to put up high numbers in a losing effort than it is on a winning effort:

•If the losing team never actually stood that much of a chance then no, the best player on that team shouldn’t get it

•If the losing team stood a chance but the best player on the losing team barely outplayed the best player on the winning team, then no, the loser shouldn’t get it

•If the losing team stood a chance and the best player on the losing team far outplayed the best player on the winning team, then yes, the loser should get it || What is the intended outcome of playing in the finals? It’s to win the finals, of course. 

If that’s the case, then the most *valuable* player should be the one who contributed the most to the winning team meeting its objective. 

This may leave a bad taste in people’s mouths for a variety of reasons, but that’s just how it’s generally been accepted to be. || No, FMVP should go to a player on the winning team. I view the award as which player made the largest impact for the winning team. I think an amazing performance by a player on the losing team should be remembered, but what exactly is the value if it results in a loss? I don’t even think a player on the losing team would be remotely interested in winning that award. || Yes, to a small extent.  LeBron was 1 vote away from winning the 2015 Finals MVP (initial votes were LeBron: 4, Iggy: 4, Steph: 3, then the Steph votes consolidated to Iguodala).

If the Cavs lost in Game 7 LeBron would’ve won the award as Draymond was the Warriors leading candidate and he missed a game, while LeBron led the series in every stat category.

The Told Larry Bird that he would’ve won in 1984 even if the Celtics had lost game 7. 

And Jerry West won in 1969, and I think a lot of people believe this was due to there not being a precedent, but I believe if that series happened again today, that West still would’ve won the award due to his dominance.

 So if it’s close, it should always go to the winner, but when the series is close and the individuals are not, it should be able to go to a player on the losing side. || Yes. Think about the regular season MVP award. The vast majority of people oppose the idea of just giving it to the best player on the team with the best record. It should go to the player who has the best performance throughout the series, even if that player's team doesn't win the series. || I think it should be possible but exceedingly rare.

Anytime any ""MVP"" conversation comes up of any kind it all comes down to what the individual person means when they say ""valuable"". Like what is their definition of ""value""/""valuable"" because it's clearly not the same for everyone. Could actually be pretty easily resolved by changing MVP award names to something more descriptive and specific but protracted debates about things like MVP are super useful to the league(s) so no incentive to change it. || If you take away the most valuable player from a losing team, they still lose. || [removed] || The best player means the best player and I'm not sure why this is such a controversial issue in American sports.  Diego Forlan won the golden ball in SA 2010 and Messi won it in Qatar; the latter also won the world cup and the former did not. It's really not that complicated but inertia and some informal rule means people get irrationally upset at recognising the best player outright. || Yeah why not

Lebron outplayed everyone on the Warriors when Igoudala won FMVP but they didn’t want to give it to the loser so Igoudala became the guy by default 

It damaged Steph’s resume to lose FMVP to a role player more than it would have to lose it to Lebron who was carrying the Cavs with no Kyrie or KLove || No, absolutely not.

The entire purpose of professional sports is to win and your *value* as a player is determined by your ability to help that team win. It doesn't matter how good your stats are, if your team doesn't win you are less valuable than a player with lesser stats.

I just don't understand the other side of this. How can you be most *valuable* if you lose? It's the Most Valuable Player award, not the Best Player award.

I get that Lebron is a far better player than Iggy, and individually had much better numbers. But in that series Iggy was more valuable to his team than Lebon was to his because he helped his team win and Lebron didn't. || It makes 100% sense that a player on a losing team could get the finals MVP but sports Journos have the simplest reading of things. There are seemingly endless examples of the ""best"" player not being rewarded for their accomplishments and impact on the field. This happens all the time with Heisman Trophy and the NFL MVP. I would love for a player on a losing team to win the award. We should be able to appreciate and recognize incredible performances even if they don't win. Granted, if you get swept/blown out, you likely won't be considered, but dragging a lesser team to a game 6 or 7 and losing close could certainly result in a FMVP, IMO. || Yes, it should be allowed, but only the narrowest of possible circumstances could justify it. The winning team would have to be a real ensemble with no obviously critical player. The Finals would have to go seven games, with the losing team BARELY not winning the title. And the losing team’s best player would have to put up a historically-dominant performance, so great that it doesn’t even seem debatable. 

No such example has happened in the last fifty years and it seems unlikely to happen. But I think that it should definitely be allowed. || Fine with it but the qualifiers would be pretty strict. Needs to be a 6 or 7 game series, and the player needs to have an all-time level performance head and shoulders above anyone on the winning team. 

A 4 or 5 game series I’d say I never would consider it. And if it goes 6 or 7 but someone on the winning team has a great performance of their own then they deserve it. || No. Someone might technically have been more valuable on the losing team, but giving it to them is some sort of cruel participation trophy.

""Hey you're crying over there in your locker room (or should be) but come out here for this award.""

That player values goes to zero once the team loses. Because if that player got injured right before the series, his team still loses. It is what it is. || Not as obvious but I think Kawhi largely won his first FMVP because he defended LeBron rather than Kawhi being the best player in the finals. Lebron was probably the best player in both those series. I get why the award basically always goes to someone on the winning team but I don't think I agree with the logic. || No. 

The ultimate value is in winning. 

Unless we want sport to be qualitative instead of quantitative. 

In which case, just award the chip to the team we ‘think’ is the best. Not the team that won. || Shoulda just been named as Playoffs MVP. With half points from playoffs and the other from Finals || This is purely anecdotal and I haven't looked at the numbers in totality. But, I did remember watching the actual game. LeBron scores a lot of garbage time points in losing games and not really impacting the chances of winning by a meaningful amount. The defense isn't actively trying to prevent him from scoring without fouling. I remember one of the games he was around 25 pts, and by the end of it scored in the mid-30's in a losing effort. || FMVP should just not exist as a real award. It's no more than those Player of the Game ""awards"" given out after every televised game. There's no real vetting process. || Who would win FMVP? Lakers vs Celtics

The Celtics have a balanced attack and win the series in 6 games. Luka delivers a dominant performance but the Lakers lose with limited contributions from the rest of the team.

Tatum averages 23/8/8

KP averages 20/5/4

JB averages 18/8/3

White averages 18/5/6

Jrue averages 12/4/7

Rest of team: 20 points

- - -

Luka averages a triple double with 35/10/12

LeBron averages 22/10/7

Reaves: 18 points

Rest of team: 25 points || No, it should never go to the losing team. It’s a straight up ridiculous idea

Competitors want to win, not get a consolation prize for being really good while coming up short || I think that it should go to the best player on the losing team if the series is close and the losing team's player was significantly better than the best performer on the winning team. || Let's be honest. Everyone thought gsw was that flash in the pan team like 75 gsw or 78 Seattle. Yeah u won now the real teams of the league will take over. 2016 steph happened and they realized oh shit we fucked up we thought u were a one off and gave him unanimous mvp as an apology for not giving him fmvp. 2018 steph fucked himself over and these voters were desperate to give him one knowing they fucked him over and created a 6 yr legacy narrative because he was the only 26 ppg scorer in nba history to not have a fmvp and that looks bad on them || If the series was close, then yes.

Example -

If the 2018 finals went to 7 games and LeBron performed anywhere close to his Game 1 performance, then he should be FMVP.

Since the 2018 finals ended as a sweep, even if LeBron drops 50 for 4 straight games, he shouldn’t win FMVP. || No because no player on a losing team would want it. It would feel like a consolation prize that they don’t deserve || The Finals MVP should go to whoever earns the most votes—simple as that. There’s no rule that it has to go to someone from the winning team. Players on the losing side receive FMVP votes all the time. So yes, it *can* go to a player on the losing team. It always could. It just rarely happens because the losing player usually doesn't do *enough* to earn the majority. But eventually, it’ll happen again. || Yes. With all due respect to Jerry's feelings, the most valuable player is simply the most valuable player. || i think it depends. 

if player A averages 24, 6 and 6 and player b averages 25, 6 and 6 and player A wins the chip, i don’t think player B deserves finals mvp because he put up better stats. 

but if it’s like 2015 lebron then yea || Yes. Notable players include.

2024 Luka Dončić

2018 LeBron James

2017 LeBron James

2014 LeBron James

2001 Allen Iverson || Yes, I think the award should go to the best/most impactful player, even if they were on the losing team. Fun fact, that actually has happened just one time in NBA history in 1969 when Jerry ""The Logo"" West AKA Mr. Clutch won Finals MVP despite his Lakers losing to the Celtics in 7 games. The man averaged 38 pts, 5 rebs, and 7 asts that series! || FMVP’s, like all such things, can’t be determined by reading stats after the game. You have to actually watch the games. There wasn’t any huge controversy at the time because Iggy was absolutely sensational and locked up prime Lebron and fed his team in a way that was clear to anyone who watched. Steph could have gotten it too, but Iggy deserved it. Giving it to the loser is bad form in my opinion. Let the winners enjoy the spoils. || Nope. The goal is to win the championship, the championship is where the value is derived. The goal is not to get amazing stats or perform the best. The team that wins should receive mvp because that's the only team that has value. || No.  If your team didn't win then you are not that ""VALUABLE"", no matter what your stats say.  You can average 100 points, 30 rebounds, 25 assists but if your team didn't win, then those points/reb/asts are not that valuable.  They are OUTSTANDING but not valuable.  If it was for the MOP, then yes, losing team player can be MOP but not MVP. || It's still kinda mind-boggling to me why they didn't give 2022 FMVP to Wiggins, that would support both 2018 KD and 2015 Iggy's case in that sense

if you give 2018 MVP to KD because of Curry's bad game 3, why not just give 2022 MVP to Wiggins because of Curry's bad game 5? || Imo, Lebron does has solid argument for the Final MVP, but him winning that Final MVP will be use against him by people that don't like him

""Mickey Mouse Final MVP""
""The NBA don't want their face of the league to look bad so they give him the Final MVP""
""Loser Trophy""

Even if you think by the number Lebron does deserve that Final MVP, Lebron hater does not care, they see a trophy that has always been given to the winning team since 1970 other than Jerry West and now it is given to the losing team. They see it as The NBA trying to protect Lebron image as being seen as a loser. || Giving it to a losing player sets a bad precedent of prioritizing and cherry picking personal stats over doing whatever it takes to help your team succeed. Giving it to LeBron on a team that lost is just glorified ass kissing. || Just don't lie to me.

If you want it to be MVP of the winning team then say that, make those the only players eligible and have done with it.

The rest is all mental gymnastics.

It's simple and obvious that in a team sport the player who had the single best performance in a game won't always win if the other team plays collectively better.

Take it to the extreme, one player scores a hundred points in a game on perfect shooting but at the end of the game there's a brawl, all his teammates get ejected and the team has to forfeit. I don't think that player did nothing of value in that game.

Or if we follow the line of logic through to the conclusion. For regular season MVP should we only look at what players did in the games their team won, if that's the only games they produced value in.

It means in the 2015 Finals Lebon was less valuable than Festus Ezeli, because Lebron's team lost so nothing he did had any value, and Ezeli's team won so he added some value.

But saying it like that makes it evident how absurd that is.

If you think it is more entertaining or enjoyable to have an award for the best performing player on the winning team, fine. Have that award, it's an entertainment industry. But don't pretend players on the losing side are eligible, or that you're including them when talking about who was most valuable.

Just don't lie to me. || I think the regular season mvp suffers more from the narrative and team record than the finals mvp does from what you’re discussing here. There’s definitely been instances like the lebron situation you mentioned that I think you can make a real argument for a losing player to receive the award, but the award is named after bill russell and he won 11 rings. In my opinion the finals mvp should go to a winning player almost all of the time but a truly special series from a losing player should put them in contention for the award. || This is so interesting with basketball because it’s such a team effort that, while I suppose there could be a hypothetical FMVP on the loser team, as many have already said, it seems strange how he could have been THE most valuable player yet couldn’t win. 
That being said I could imagine a humdrum World Series from the offensive standpoint, but the losing team’s ace pitching lights out for two games and is clearly the best performance of the 7 game series. Maybe even closes game 6 in extras who knows this is hypothetical. But in that case yeah I could see the pitcher getting WSmvp even if his team can’t hit and loses? 
Even football: a losing quarterback throws like five touchdowns and 0 interceptions for 500 yards…. But his defense and special teams loses it for him? And the other teams scores are spread out among like ten guys or whatever. 
But basketball… man it’s like play is socialized. Everybody matters. Everybody has responsibility for the game. Nobody can hide. It’s kind of what I love most
About the game tbh || I'm going to say no because most likely the fmvp would be in a bad mood after losing and spoil the award ceremony. I think the best player on the winning team holds more weight in a playoff situation than in the regular season. On a side note, Steph should have won over iggy simply for the fact that LeBron was in the conversation for mvp for how dominant he was.  How can LeBrons defender win the award if LeBron dominates? || No, it’s a bad idea for the simple reason that in a completely dominant series by one side ;4-0 or 5-0) with 3 very good performances from a winning team but no stand out performance dud to no opportunity or need for any one player to dominate, a player on the losing team should not win by virtue of carrying a disproportionate burden more efficiently in a mollywhooping. || out of all the media awards which are already meaningless the fmvp has to be at the very bottom. it's an award voted by max 6-10 media members which includes the broadcasters of the game. || No. Tatum could have scored more last finals and had better stats, but maybe lost the series. He didn't win FMVP anyway, but I think it's happier with winning. || For me the answer is found in the name of the award.

The most valuable player. The only valuable thing in a Finals is winning it. Therefor the player who, over the curse of the whole series, impacted the win the most.

We can create a ""Gatorade Max Performance Player"" award for a subjective award, given to the player from both teams who looks like the best individual player - but the FMVP is not automatically the same. || I say if it wasn't previously given out to the loser, then it should only be given to one of the winners, but it's already happened. We've seen that some losers truly are the best in the series. Even coming from a lebron hater, i say he deserved it way more than iggy. Also, Connor McDavid won the NHL ""fmvp"" just last year, and it didn't seem odd at all, or maybe I just wasn't paying attention all that much. || You CANNOt be the MVP of a finals and lose in less than 7 games. How? They didn't even need all the possible games to beat you. You can't have been THAT valuable.

So for me the circumstances have to be perfect, you have to be so much better than everyone else and be the obvious best player in the series, and lose in 7 preferably in a hard fought down to the wire game, or even an overtime. || McDavid won the Conn Smyth (NHL finals MVP) last year despite losing. It’s rare but it does happen || Yes but only if it goes to players I don’t like. Not an NBA example, but McDavid winning the Conn Smythe was hilarious.

On a more serious note, I do think the FMVP should go to a player on the losing team if that player completely carried their team to a 7 game series and the other team doesn’t have any standouts. Should be very rare. || No. Unless it’s a really, really extreme case where it’s a 7 game series of super close games and a guy on the losing team averages a 30 point triple double compared to like an inefficient 19 for the winning team’s leading scorer, but the chances of that happening are so unlikely || When are you guys going to understand the concept of decisive impact in key moments? LeBron rarely had that in his career. Yes, he scored some buzzer beaters. Yes, he had some fantastic finals and playoffs games/series. But he also disappeared when it mattered most way too often. The MVP delivers consistently AND takes over when it matters most. || I don't think LeBron deserved it. Russ had terrible efficiency vs the Rockets back in 2017 round one; even though his counting stats were good. I don't see people reminiscing of how amazing he was that series (granted it was a 1st round series and not the NBA finals but still). || I know it is a different sport but McDavid won FMVP despite losing in the SCF. || I think it should be formulaic.  We collect enough data now that there is little reason to vote.  || I could see Jokic doing this if he ever gets back to the finals.

He just puts up such massive numbers, and he's clutch as well. || >Or should we reserve FMVP solely to a player on the winning team?

We effectively do. I don't know why the FMVP pretends that it doesn't.  If you ignored who won the games, there's no way anyone could say Iguodala was ""more valuable"" to the Warriors than LeBron was to the Cavs in that series.  

You can say Iguodala did more to help the Warriors win than LeBron did to help the Cavs win. Because the Warriors won more.  But then by definition, the FMVP doesn't go to anyone on the losing team.

So why not just come out and say it?  And if you don't, then I'm still astounded that anyone thought Iggy played better than Lebron in that 2015 series. || Has to be overwhelmingly good. And series has to be close. Some of the comments about 2014 I cant even fathom. LeBron had no impact in that series. Not even a little. || In a few circumstances, yes. Certainly not something that happens often, but there have been a few series where it would have been justifiable. i.e: LeBron in 2015.

Ultimately, if it didn't go to Iggy, it should have gone to LeBron. Curry had 0 business being in the conversation if it wasn't Iggy's for being the x-factor and the reason for their series win. || Technically yes. Whether we should though...that's another question. NBA is entertainment. It's more fun and proper at that moment to award FMVP to someone on the winning team. || I think if there's any disagreement about whether a player on the losing team can win FMVP then yes, they should be able to win it, because clearly it's not a hard and fast rule that the FMVP needs to be on the winning team. The argument is basically: ""who was the most valuable player to their team that ultimately made this series what it was?""


But, if someone were to take a step back and begin the conversation by saying FMVP can only be on the winning team -- because winning is what it's all about -- then I would have zero qualms with their logic. || No, it should never go to what player had the best individual stats if that player was on the losing team. It should be the player that most impacts winning. I’d even go as far to say that the FMVP should be picked from the winning team only considering games in which that team won the game. Who cares if u put up 70 points in a loss. That loss doesn’t help you win the series. || No, because the point of the sport is to win.

A loser's value just doesn't matter. || Absolutely. I said this every time: either Steph or Lebron should have gotten FMVP. Iggy mvp was the dumbest shit imaginable and singlehandedly devalued that award for years to come. I love Iggy but he had no business being anywhere near that award averaging 15 pts, and i will die on this hill.

Its like if they gave Delavadova the fmvp over Lebron, clownworld. || ""Most Valuable"" does not mean ""Best."" It should go to the player who provided the most value to his team.

If the Cavs don't have Lebron in the 2015 Finals, they probably get swept. If the Warriors don't have Curry, they probably lose the series.

So, what is more valuable, losing in 6 instead of 4, or winning a championship vs not winning a championship?

Very very hard to convince me a player on a losing team should ever get FMVP, even if they are the best player. I want the guy who is the reason the winning team was the winning team. || No, same way that league MVP usually goes to superstar on best team, finals should be the same.  Really should have went to Steph Curry, the gravity he brings that the entire opposing defense is trying to stop and double team him made the games a 4v3 or even 4v2 on the offensive end and with that advantage they won. || No FMVP should go to the best player on the winning team.

It just doesn’t seem right to even do that in my opinion. Yes there have been cases where you can argue that the loser had the best player in the series but runner ups shouldn’t be rewarded for losing. || Yes, IMO.  The most valuable player in the finals should get the FMVP, even if he lost the series due to having non-valuable teammates. || No. Every superstar player can put up great numbers when they have no other choice on the losing team. The finals MVP should always go to the best player on the winning team. All those efforts are meaningless if you still lost in the end.  || no, if your team doesnt win you are not valuable enough. The award is for most valuable player, not guy who almost got it done.  loke giving a best at sex award to a guy that cant get her off just cause he had a lot of thrusts 🫠 || For me, Most valuable, would imply that they're essential for their team's success. If their team failed to succeed, they weren't valuable enough. So no, I don't think anyone on the losing team deserves FMVP. Otherwise, Jokic would be unanimous MVP this season, but we all know the talking heads will vote for SGA. || I believe so, yes. I think LeBron 2015 deserved it. I do wish I had more examples tho || As a hockey fan who has seen this... this is a bad idea. It brings down the mood of the finals celebration. Last year, Connor McDavid won the Playoff MVP he never stepped foot back on the ice after they shook hands, and he left. 

Have you ever seen [JS Giguere](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/s/sug9yg7iIq) after his Conn Smythe (Playoff MVP) win when the Ducks lost? Its absolutely depressing. || I think it should be a mix of the team's performance and the player's contribution to it. If the team gets swept then the best player better have otherworldly stats to get the FMVP.

 Apart from that I don't think the FMVP should only go to the players from the winning team. I don't even know why it's happening when there's a clear precedent set with Jerry west. || Yes, but only if the difference is significant. Like 2015, Lebron was so far and away the best player in the series. Like no one was even close. 2018, Lebron was again the best player in the series but KD was also really fucking good so his FMVP was deserved. But there haven't been many Finals series I remember where the difference was that significant. || Jerry West got the MVP even though his Lakers lost a Bill Russell Celtics me thinking Bill Russell should’ve got that MVP but hey just my opinion || [removed] || To me, if you took Iguodala out of that team, you aren't losing the most valuable player of that team (Curry). versus, LeBron by far was the best player of his finals team. So yes I think that he should've gotten it over him that finals. || Yeah. I think so. I think LeBron was the best player on the floor for ever series against the Warriors. 

I think Shaq was the best player on the floor in 2004. 

The thing is, doesn't anybody on the losing team WANT the FMVP? 

I think the answer is a resounding 'NO!'

So it's not so much a question of whether a guy on the losing team deserves it. It's a question of whether a guy on the losing team wants it. 

Can you imagine answers questions from the media after? ""Does earning FMVP take some of the sting away from losing the series?"" FUCK NO!!!!

Or the best guy on the winning team? ""Do you think you should have gotten FMPV?"" || bro isnt it like 10 random media ppl that vote for finals mvp?

i remember seeing some of the names on the list and i almost shit myself

that time they gave iggy mvp over steph was crazy and the worse by far

feels like they mostly get it right cause its mostly obvious

so funny tatum didnt get mvp nor should he have || If Kawhi hadn’t developed into a legit all-timer, the 2014 FMVP would be seen the same way as the 2015 one. || Steph had a disaster class game 2 shooting 5-23 and also Iggy had by far the highest plus minus for the series so it’s really not that absurd unless all you care about is offense || Jerry West won it once after the Lakers lost (again) to the Celtics in game 7 on the last shot.  Maybe it was just because it was so close that they gave it to him || Seriously.  The fact that people have been able to use ""haha choker no fmvp"" against Steph until the 2022 ring is absolutely foul, considering that in 2015, the warriors would have gotten swept 4-0 without Steph and maybe won in 7 without iggy. || [removed] || What people don’t seem to understand anymore is that no one gave a shit about Finals MVP until it became a weird thing in the LeBron GOAT and LeBron-Steph conversation.

There’s very few voters for the award and it was clear Iggy got it because he was the X factor, not the most valuable player.

There was no outrage because no one really gave a shit, and XFactor, MVP, whatever.

It only became a thing AFTER, largely to attack Curry. || Also Dellavedova overplayed for 2 games. Which is huge. 2 Finals games. The man deserves tons of credit. Mentally he was still in the zone until the last minute, but physically he was done. || [removed] || It happens far more often than just 2015. || Didn’t Kyrie go down in game 1? || Iggy won it as a fill in for Lebron, that was the point. || Luka was better than Brown or Tatum in the 2024 NBA Finals. || For me it’s LeBron in 2018 || I've been watching since the late 70s. No one else is close. I actually think he should have won it. It is one of the best carry jobs of all time. That lineup without LeBron is barely over a 20 win team. || LeBron shot less than 40% from the field in 2015. His outside shot was almost entirely broken. Sure, the roster was super injured and of poor quality, but I can think of different losing performances where players did better than that.

Hell, I’d say his 2017 performance was clearly better than his 2015 one."

75 Goodwin

69 Bronny

Reasons:

Lebron hasn’t been at 100% since his groin injury and has been playing at a solid low 90s. Playoffs is more important and we all know he’s going to pop off like he does everyone year.

Rui’s skillset is too good to be an 81 player. He’s a 45%+ open shooter and has developed his defense as a lengthy wing.

DFS has a similar role as Rui but doesn’t have the body to bang low for rebounds or box out. Instead, he is way more dynamic on defense and is elite from the corners.

Vando is a god tier defender, but defense is always criminally underrated in 2K. 78 seems about right, but his real impact is greater.

Hayes has really grown as a starting big, but is still limited as a rebounder and anchor threat. 

DK is going to shoot straight into the 80s next year, but still needs time to put it all together. For now, he’s still a catch and shoot player that gets targeted by other teams. His decision making isn’t there yet.

Goodwin is great as a backup, but still somewhat unreliable/inconsistent on offense. Good defender, 75 seems appropriate. 

Bronny at this point has caught up with the rookies in his draft class. 69 is a meme rating but skill wise he’s probably in the low 70s already. || Luka 98, DFS 81, Knecht 75, Vando 78 || Quentin Grimes is a 85 and Austin Reaves is 87 lmao that’s insane to me somehow || DFS should be higher 81 at least || Why is Dalton rating more than the DFS? || DFS lower than Dalton is a hate crime || DFS is like, leading the team in +/- || Been spamming pick and roll with this team with rui and ar for my three. || Dalton rated higher than DFS is mental illness, so no surprises here || Austin should be 90 at most 88 at least || ![gif](giphy|Do6OWgAL0HT9Pept01) || what the hell do they even base this shit on, in what world is Knecht higher than DFS.

Tf is this || Why isn’t bronny a 99? || Luka should be 99 and Lebron should be 94 || Dfs is better than rui it’s obvious when you watch but not when you look at just the stats..they don’t take into account game sense and IQ || Luka’s a bit overrated here. He’s slightly too inefficient, unathletic, a defensive liability, lacks a post game, and he's an unpolished leader—that doesn’t add up to a 96. The only way this rating makes sense is if some of his offensive attributes are boosted beyond the max to prop up the overall score.

Luka should be a 95 or lower, like Steph. LeBron, on the other hand, deserves at least a 97. He has no real weaknesses—he’s elite across the board. Strength, speed, IQ, leadership, shooting, post work, iso, zone—you name it. He’s still the most complete player in the league. || He should be 80, our team would look so different if he wasn't playing || Dalton being rated the same or higher than DFS is complete disrespect and BS.

They’re not even in the same conversation. || everytime I play this team in 2K they keep spamming Dalton into the rotations while acting like like Doe doesn’t exist and it pisses me off lol || 100% but defense is not rated right for overall rating in 2k either way || 2k ratings don’t value that stuff much. It’s mostly for offense which he provides none of  || more on ball offense id say and not off ball stuff like screen settling. agreed though || DFS is like an 80 tbh || [deleted] || Dalton being the same rating as Gabe is wild lol... should be like a 70-75 fs || [removed] || What was Pelinka even thinking trading an 81 and 3 picks for a 76. || D’Lo on a garbage team is a lot more skilled than DFS. The ratings are based on skillsets not how valuable someone is to a team.

But man he had tough and ""naughty""(to say it very lightly) personality. || Kobe was tight and cool w D Fish, Odom, and Pau. I never saw him try to really bond w guys, but like you said that wasn’t his style.

Not everyone is a born leader, but Kobe had a million other things going for him so it’s all good. || Some time in the 90s people started being fans of players more than teams. || I think a lot of ppl became fans of the team when Kobe was playing, and then once he retired and ultimately passed away they realized they were bigger fans of the player than the team.

Then you have the ridiculous “I’m a Kobe fan so I’m obligated to hate LeBron for no good reason whatsoever” assholes who I wish would just go away or root for another team. I’m yet to have a Kobe fan who hates LeBron give me an even slightly good reason on why they feel that way. They can’t do it because then they’d have to say “I hate LeBron because I’m insecure about Kobe’s legacy and feel like LeBron cheapens it because he’s a better player.” That makes ZERO sense and is extremely weak. Kobe wasn’t insecure and knew his legacy is undeniable. Some fans don’t feel that way? F ‘em.

Instead a lot of them hang around like leeches just to take shots at LeBron and patiently wait for him to retire which is an awful use of time and energy imo.

Unless LeBron did something awful to you personally, which I don’t think many Lakers fans if any can say, you root for LeBron because he’s a Laker and saved us from the gutter we were in.

Like just enjoy greatness. 
Especially if it’s wearing the purple & gold. 

(Or don’t 🤷‍♂️) || I’ve been a lakers fan for 32 years and I love LBJ || Ok I’ll play. 

Kobe, RIP to him and Gigi, had us in the lottery in his final seasons. Landing and overpaying for FA like Deng and Mosgov. We were trotting out G league teams. 

Then Bron chooses to join as FA. Gets AD to join, and produces a chip in 2020. The Westbrook trade, which Bron signed off, set us back 2-3 seasons. We remain a fringe playoff/play-in team most seasons. Then we luck into Luka and clinched the 3 seed last night. 

You’re likely a Kobe stan, which is understandable. 
Or maybe a Jordan guy. To each their own. || Found one! Lmaooo you guys are pure entertainment. Keep it up 👍 || Quickness doesn't always equate to unguardable bro. It's about being able to use what you have and expose the defense. For example, the ability to switch speeds, being unpredictable, and craftiness are of many elements that could make you hard to guard. These elements, paired with HIGH IQ makes him hard to guard. Put some respect in AR's game. || He took too much from Jordan and always was a loner but Kobe was honestly not a good teammate for much of his career. That much is fair to say.

It’s crazy how people shit on LeBron for his LeGM shit but he’s always been known to elevate his teammates and make them better. He’s played with how many damn players over the last 22(!) years and almost no one has bad things to say about him. Even Kyrie who he was beefing with is friends with him again. The fact that he vouched for JR Smith to come back to the bubble team and got him a free ring says volumes about him || I don't agree with the bully part. He held people accountable for their effort, not the outcome. || Kobe was polarizing. He needed to see if you were on the same page as him and can understand the game. That’s when he’s a great teammate and mentor. But if you’re not, then he doesn’t tolerate laziness, stupidity, and unseriousness and becomes a bully || It’s kinda weak. 

To have “that dude” land on YOUR team is the greatest feeling ever.

Bring a player first fan is fine, but I feel like it’s an easy way to pick an all-star then just experience a lot of winning.

I also think being a team first fan means more because in most cases you’re rooting for a team from where you used to live or live now. || I hear you. I didnt focus much on an era 25+ years old. || Dude 💯, he empowered them || Yeah, I’ve been a fan since the Showtime days and I think Bron’s pretty amazing both for the Lakers and the NBA as a whole. You never hear a bad word about him from any modern players. I don’t get the hate at this point || Right there with you. 
Since ‘87. || Lmao you 40 sounding 16. 👍 || wtf did you type all this for? 

To prove you are a Bron bandwagon?

So it was Kobe’s decision to get Deng and Mozgov? Kobe said I need these two guys to help me win?


Let me get this straight, Bron left Cleveland at the age Luka is now, and went to Miami to team up with 2 HoF in Wade and Bosh.

Then went on to Cleveland to team up with two other HoF in Kyrie and Love.

Then he came to the Lakers with a HoF in AD, and now has Luka, a HoF. 

Sounds like he’s had elite help for the last 15 years. || Is that worse than being 16 sounding 8? || Bron joined Miami as a FA. Miami wanted him more than he wanted them. Won them 2 chips. Went back to Cleveland as a FA, who welcomed him back with open arms after the decision. Took them to multiple Finals and won them a chip.  Then joined the Lakers as a FA with a bunch of young talent with potential, was instrumental in getting AD to join. 

Basketball is a team sport. You need help. 
Jordan doesn’t win without Pip, Grant, Rodman. 
Shaq/Kobe don’t win without Horry, Fish, Fox, Gasol, Odom, Artest. 
Steph doesn’t win without Klay, Dray, KD, etc. 

So you just Bron, got it. 
Hopefully you still like the Lakers. 

I’m a Laker diehard since ‘87. || Is that the best you came up with? 🥱 || So in FA you just leave? 

The mental gymnastics to not admit he turned his back on Cleveland twice. 

Rose woulda never turned his back on Chicago and Chicago wouldn’t have either if he never got injured.

My point is he has achieved far less than the other GOAT candidates with more help. 

Nobody was saying Kareem over MJ except for contrarians, for those who wanna say scoring title and longevity is the argument for Bronz

Yall missing the nuances, I woulda expected more from a 50 year old. 🥱 || Yes the F is for free. 
Free to leave or stay. 

Imagine being so good at your craft/job, you get to pick where you work and even some of your coworkers?

Loyalty works both ways. Did the Bulls stay loyal to Rose when his injuries mounted up? No, as an organization they were also free to trade or release him. 

You sound like you’re riding for billionaire owners and cities. Which is certainly a stance to take. ✌🏽 || It’s called loyalty to a team, not only that, to put your city on your back. 

Lmao that’s new propaganda, you sound young with no thoughts of your own.

If you don’t understand injuries happen, and that will definitely change things, but curious, did Lebron suffer an injury or he just turned his back on his city twice?

Lmao where the hell did I bring up owners? Trying to win a fake argument? 🤡

Funny how no old heads in real life like Bron but online in the Lakers sub is a buncha “old heads” gargling Bron talking like 16 year olds. || It’s a job man. Being super loyal to a job/department usually doesn’t get you anything. If something happens to you, guess what your company does tomorrow? They turn on the lights and it’s business as usual. 

Hating on Bron for moving around to where he thought was best because he could is funny stuff. 

There’s levels to this. 
Some of which you don’t understand. || Lmao you sound like you don’t value loyalty, did you get fired from a job that dogged you? 🙄

Sound like a selfish person who prefers the easy way, nothing wrong with that, but those are not my morales.

Levels of morality, acting like every decision business or partnership doesn’t speak on your morales and character. Lmao you ain’t deep bruh. || Boom you got it man. 🤓
Have fun. 😆"

Man unc needs to go get a nap. If it was pre-game, sure. There’s nobody in the stands, the problem is the camera being there not LeBron on chest lmao. || It was like an epic rant and Steve Smith was agreeing with him || wtf is this from lol || Yeah Kobe and Gary are always going to be associated with each other in our memories. || Feels like he’s “wearing…nothing at all” || You should probably see a LeCock Doctor || this is like michael cooper giving Bron shit for eating fruit all over again || 2007 SNL.

OG crew been stuck in it for a few years now || Just like a dad buying ice cream for his kids. But this time, Playoffs secured. No more Play-in || MJ could never 😭😭 || AR said on the post game they were celebrating not being in the play in Lolol || This shit is a like a drug to me.  I love the vibes from the team.  Austin and Bron supporting each other and cutting it up is just so fun to see. Rui has that same vibe with them too.  So glad they've added Vincent VanDoe,  and Luka to that mix || Lakers celebrating for finally being out of the play-in. || Suffering through Hamas makes you appreciate the good times so much more || I hope lebron's injury is just a case of big balls syndrome the way he is celebrating in the bench🤣 || ""We don't have Darvin Ham and we're not in the play-in!!"" 

YAYYYYYY!! LOL || lol, bron jumping around.. yup his ok. gonna be ready playoff time.. || Lol luka being left hanging at 0:06 || LeWholesome || You love to see it. || vibes at an all-time high. ring #18 coming soon... || I fucking love this team || I love this team so much. 

3rd secured. LET’S GET THIS FKING CHIP BOYS. || Have you guys noticed the scoring chemistry with LAL (Luka, Austin, LeBron)? The pieces fit really well.

1) Luka starts off hot in the 1st half, but tires out later in the game. 20+ in the first half is the usual.
2) Austin takes some time to get going, but usually turns it up to close the second quarter and to maintain leads through the 3rd quarter.
3) Bron is the closer. Feels it out in the first half and gets everyone else scoring. Starts to turn it up in the all important 3rd quarter. The 4th quarter is his this year and Bron should win clutch player of the year. || I’ve never been a Lakers fan and have actively disliked a number of their squads, but I fucking love this team since the Luka trade. || this dude is literally living my dream, what a life || LeBron LOVES AR 😂 || YAY we can rest a week!! 🤣 || Lefine || They left Luka hanging… in all seriousness tho, VIBES ARE UP! || Love these two!!! || AD be like Squidward looking down the window at Spongebob and Patrick. || Luka left hanging || This is by far the most fun Lakers team and the most fun LeBron team. It's a pretty odd confluence. || ngl, this was so cute. || Lol why does he act more happy with Reaves than his own son || I fucking love this team so much || Reaves is a dawg. Just recognizing. I'm comfortable. You should be to. || LeReaves || Luka averaging 35, Bron's unstoppable drive, AR's shimmy shake jive... Lakers in 🖐️! || No play in, let's go then, onto the next playoffs win..Lakers in ✋️ || So fucking glad no play in. || Wonder if bronny is jealous? || lakers cooking up a storm, banner number 18 inbound, ad's time to shine ✨ || This is gonna be such a good gif || mhh weird! As a Mavs fan I was told that Luka is not good for chemistry? Not sure what to believe now. || “Yehey!” || Dorks. || Gonna make Bronny jealous 😂 || LBJ has serious big brother energy. || He’s like my 2k player came to life || Goes to show how much they hated being in the Play-In tournament || Bron told him ‘we don’t have to be in the play-in anymore!’ || Bron likes AR and hates Luka. || Was he saying “NO PLAY-IN!” || \>>>>>>>>>>>. bro what but W lbj and ar15 || I love that we have Mac from Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!! || That’s so beautiful to see.. || With the way LeBron had his hand out I was imagining something different at first…..

Literally did f*** all …lol || Workplace bullying![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|surprise) || ![gif](giphy|eyfmfTMgx5WYE) || Mavs lied, Luka cried, All star Reaves has arrived, Lakers in ✋🏽! || I'm so damn ready for the playoffs Luka gets revenge wins a ring and LeBron and his son win a fucking ring together. I hate Dallas and I really hate Boston. Fuck them dearly and deep we are winning the ring. || Kawhi, Canada Dry, Gilgeous Alexander Shai, it don't matter, Lakers in 5 || The second Luka got traded I threw $100 down on the Lakers lmao || Gg || Now that you mention it, they do look like they might be related….. 👀 || I love Bronny but

Austin Reaves is Jesse and Bronny is Walt JR || Kinda hilarious Bron and reaves are the longest tenured players on the roster 😂



It just seems kinda funny, reaves was a rookie the other day, lebron is lebron fucking James.



Obviously people are gonna talk about Luka and Bron all day but Reaves is literally Lebron's guy.


He's been through the shit, developed through it, and rose out of it. All while Bron was wondering if things would ever click from coaching to stars to role players.



Bron and Reaves are like that || Lmao he said it in the post game interview after saying he and LeBron aren’t friends and don’t get along 🤣🤣 || It felt good to finally get a week off. || I saw this as them jokingly celebrating that Bronny Jr was brought into the game. Reaves started jumping as soon as his name was announced. || Didn’t they already avoid the play in after the Dallas win? This locked in 3rd seed || Bronny: ""Dad, I'm on the team!"" || LMAO, my thought exactly 😂 || He would punch Austin like he did Kerr  || MJ would have snapped a neck….never a hug for a good reason || Straight into my veins please! || Ham wasted a healthy AD and LeBron year. He has so much to atone for. || Salute || Theyre having fun and moving the ball.  They going DEEP this year 🙏 || Longer teammates who helped him grow into a starter. || LeToughLove || Seems more like middle aged uncle vibes 😂 || No more Malone, Sylvester Stallone, E.T. Phone Home, Lakers in ✋! || This wins! || tshirt tonight || It’s the hair || had me rofl || That's crazy perspective right there lol. It feels like he got signed the other day lol || Feels like just yesterday AR’s eyes were as big as saucers when Bron was explaining the play to him. || They lived through win, lose, or draw just have fun and are now actually just having fun || I’ve been thinking about Reaves, and how he might be better than everyone who played with LeBron in Cleveland the first time.

Am I crazy for thinking that? || Damn did he say that jokingly or what || Yeah but they didn’t wanna take the foot off the gas till the 3 seed was locked || Hopefully he goes down with the Doc Rivers ship. I don’t hate the franchise but they were idiots to fire Adrian Griffin for Doc, and are basically in an always-the-bridesmaid situation with the emergence of Boston and Cleveland as top dawgs || You don’t miss Cam Reddish playing 35 minutes per game? || He wasted two years of Lebron & AD, but at least Taurean Prince got to show off his skills tho! || Gulag || timberwolves or golden state, we kill them four games straight; neither team will survive, lakers in less than 5️⃣! || Man that interview with Reave was funny asl. He wasn't paying attention in the huddle and wasn't sure if LeBron was fuckin with him or not. || It really does lmao"
