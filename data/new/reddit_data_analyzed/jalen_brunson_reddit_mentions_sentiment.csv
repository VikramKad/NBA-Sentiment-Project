In contrast, others have chosen to play the season out, effectively betting on themselves to secure generational wealth after a big season.

I worked with Malik Beasley during the same career window. It was one of the best learning experiences of my career in terms of understanding the league.

  
**Rookie Extension vs. Restricted Free Agency**

When the player is extension eligible (EE), only the team the player is currently on can make them an offer. However, during restricted free agency (RFA), any team can offer them a deal.

While who can offer the player a contract changes depending on EE or RFA, the most significant factor stays the same during both:

The player's current team is in the driver’s seat the whole time, not the player.

Teams have significant leverage over the player because they ultimately have the final say during EE and RFA.

* **EE**—There is no marketplace for players outside their current team, which increases the team’s leverage to the max.
* **RFA -** The player can receive offers and sign with another team. However, the player’s current team retains the right to match any contract offer signed and keep the player. Team leverage isn’t 100 here, but it’s not so far away.

While RFA is a better market than the EE summer, it isn’t robust. Most RFAs do not receive many offers from opposing teams due to fear and optics. This is why players relish entering unrestricted free agency (UFA). If they reach UFA with a market, it most likely means they’ve been under someone’s thumb for quite some time.

RFA is the kid’s table at Thanksgiving, while UFA is the Adult’s.

Usually, the RFA and the team resolve the situation without a formal offer being submitted from another team. This summer, Isaac Okoro and Cleveland performed this time-honored tradition.

Most offers during the EE window are for three reasons:

1. A show of good faith to a player to earn favor in the future. Think MAX players.
2. The team believes it can get a discount before the player hits RFA. The team bets that the player will outperform the upfront guaranteed money over the contract's life.
3. Strong relationship with the player’s agent or agency.

Max players who are EE get handled when the window opens; those deals are no-brainers.

Non-max extensions usually go down to the wire. This is where things can get hairy, and feelings can get hurt. It’s the Logan Roy world of deal-making: “Why are they smiling?! It’s not good if they’re smiling.”

NBA teams aren't charities; they don’t just give out money. They do it because (they believe) it will benefit them to get the deal done early.

From a team perspective, they should only sign guys to two types of extensions: these big discount lowball offers and proven superstar max extensions.

1. Max - When the window opens, Max players who are EE get handled; those deals are no-brainers. The agents, players, and fans will go wild if they don't.
2. Value - Players already producing at the number to which they are signed in their extension. It should only be an upside for the team here.

These non-max extensions usually go down to the wire. They can either prepare a team to compete in the future or handicap them with bad money that they didn’t need to commit to anyway.

This is where things can get hairy, and feelings can get hurt. It’s the Logan Roy world of deal-making: 

“Why are they smiling?! It’s not good if they’re smiling.”

Championship teams are built during this shrewd process. You have to win big on the margins to reach the ultimate goal. Golden State did it with Curry, Boston did it with Brown, and the next wave of champions will almost certainly not emerge from giving up big money a year early to players who are not already playing at a max level.

The best NBA teams aren't charities; they don’t just give out money. They do it because (they believe) it will benefit them to get the deal done early.



**An Offer You Can’t Refuse:**

Usually, it's not bad if someone is willing to give you millions of dollars. However, there is one spot where the team has more leverage than at any other time, and the player is almost forced to accept the deal, even if they would rather bet on themselves- the role-player extension.

Here is the formula to look out for (this is not a mathematical formula).

Proven Rotation Player/Potential Starter + No Path To Starting + Good Team = Bad Spot

[Moses Moody signed this type of extension for three years and 39 million](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/41911629/warriors-extend-moses-moody-3-year-39-million-deal). On the surface, this is great; he’s locked in 39 million, which, by the time it’s all said and done with taxes and fees to the union and his agents, will be around 18 million.

When I saw this extension on the ticker, it stood out. It reminded me of Malik and [my college teammate Ed Davis](https://www.espn.com/blog/los-angeles/lakers/post/_/id/40095/davis-focused-on-moving-ahead-with-lakers), who were in similar situations during the extension-eligible period of their rookie contracts.

All three thought they were good enough to start. They had shown they could be starters in the league, but they were all in a situation where their current team didn’t want them as the long-term starter.

Malik, Ed, and Moody received offers at an average annual value correlated to a top 8 rotation money: 13mm, 10mm, and 6mm.

The following season, after Ed turned down an extension offer that would have put him in line with a top-level rotation player, [he received 18 DNP-CD](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davised01/gamelog/2014); the season prior, he only had one DNP-CD.

For Malik, it was [eight DNP-CD](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/beaslma01/gamelog/2020) and five games with under 10 minutes played in 51 games with Denver after he turned down top-level bench money. The season before, he played 81 of 82 games, missing one game due to the birth of his child.

If Moody turned down this offer and entered the season looking to bet on himself, he could have suffered the same fate as Ed and Malik: Get hidden deep on the bench behind Hield, Melton, Podziemski, Wiggins, and Payton II.

Sometimes, it's impossible to bet on yourself, even if you want to; this is when teams know they can lowball the player and tank their playing time if needed.



**Bad ""Jalen"" Rookie Extension of 2024:**

**Jalen Green:** Why???

This one makes zero sense. Where is the upside? If he plays great, he'll be out of the contract before you get the payoff of him being under team control at a lower-than-market-value number because of the PO.

If he doesn't play great (as he has throughout his career), you'll be in for big money (which has to play) at a time when you have a surplus of young players who should be on the court.

**Jalen Suggs:** Sorry, I'm not in on the shooting. I do not like the mechanics enough to say he's a lock to be a consistent 40% shooter. (I've been a shooting coach for NBA players for the past seven years). I believe there will be a regression back to 35'ish this season.

He also doesn't provide enough off-the-bounce as a playmaker for that number.

What makes both of these the worst deals to me is the rush?!? Why do you need to get both of these guys on the deal a year early when you have TOTAL control of what goes on after the season?

Yes, someone could throw a poison pill deal at them, like Tyler Johnson or Allen Crabb. But more than likely, these numbers wouldn't change if both players produced at the same level this year, and honestly, I think both of them will decrease their value after the season.",40,33,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ga89bk/extension_eligible_vs_restricted_free_agency_some/,2024-10-23 07:32:44,"I hope this piece was fun and provided a look behind the curtain.

I was very green when I went through this period of Malik's career; it was my first time working in the league, and many things didn't add up then (they do now). I went deeper into Malik's EE and RFA timeline with edits and other stories.

Here is the link to the edits that correspond with that deeper dive - - you can check them out here:

[https://open.substack.com/pub/lowmanhelp/p/follow-the-money-a-teams-payroll?r=2wmouo&utm\_campaign=post&utm\_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true](https://open.substack.com/pub/lowmanhelp/p/follow-the-money-a-teams-payroll?r=2wmouo&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true) || The Jalen Green one makes sense. You are less committed so he is more valuable on trade market. If he under performs then you have a guy that is 25 that is on a 1+1 contract. That can be moved more easily than if he was on a standard 5yr extension. Even if it’s less money. 


For Jalen he believes he still has enough growth left to have a breakout season. There’s a post in here that talks about the frequency of SG breaking out around 24yrs old. If Jalen does that then he enters FA as most likely the most coveted asset of the summer and he can control his destiny. He could return back to the west coast if he desires, could join the Spurs with Wemby etc || Great write up. I see your hesitation on the Green deal - why give him a 2+1 - but I think this tips their hand that they plan to trade him next offseason. Before that deal, their  only big salaries were Van Vleet and Dillon Brooks, who they presumably would want to keep on the roster. (Sengun is also now a tradable $30 million deal, but they also see him as part of the future.) 

Now they can take back $51 million by packaging Jock Landale and Jalen Green. This means they don’t have to part with any of Jabari, Whitmore, Amen, or Reed Sheppard to make a big move now. 

At the draft they’ll be able to trade the Phoenix picks they have, their own first this year, plus three future picks and 3 swaps. That will be more than enough to get whoever they identify as their big fish target. 

And Green’s deal is short enough that even if he stalls, no team is going to see it as bad salary. Worst case, the Brooklyn Nets would take that contract into cap space next offseason for free I’d wager.  || I agree that not all Supermaxes are created equal, and the bad ones can kill a payroll/roster. 

First point: Those feel like UFA situations, not EE/RFA ones. TC got in front of that with the Edwards and McDaniels EE when they could do it. 

He did the same w/ Conely, NAW and Rudy (yesterday).

MIN and DEN will run into tax questions at some point (every great team does). The question will be whether ownership believes the group they have is worth biting down for—it’s their money, after all. || Moody's contract, Kuminga's situation, Deuce McBride contract, Jalen Green's contract, make me feel, If I'm thinking about the players' financial wellbeing, like there's a need for an NBA expansion. Golden State is getting Moody for cheap because nobody wants him, because Kerr won't play him enough. If you have a couple of extra teams looking to bet on a young player, even if It is for the same money, promising more minutes....

I mean this goes against everything the NBA and the players association say they want. Talent does not spread around because It can't, players are not getting the opportunity to get the money they should, there are less chances of players breaking out, etc. || Maybe. Yes. This is possible. But everything you're describing has them attaching assets onto Green for a team to take this contract. 

I'm not a Green fan. His game isn't a “winning” type of game, and it is very difficult to get a player to change once they've made it to the league and almost impossible once they've been paid. 

But even with that aside, they didn’t have to do this deal now. They could have played the year out. No one is knocking on the door to give Jalen Green max money. || Jalen Green's contract makes zero sense for the Rockets. 

If he's good, he'll opt out and hit free agency. So not only do you have to outbid everyone else, but if you do win you'd have A) Paid more money than what could have been his rookie extension from the start B) gone through a lot of hassle for nothing when you could've just (again) sign him to a rookie extension.

If he's bad, he opts in and you are overpaying him.

  
Though apparently, talking heads in ESPN said the Rockets made this deal because It makes him more tradeable. || Disagree. He also doesn't control his own destiny, that's the point of RFA. A player doesn't control their destiny for 7/8 years. 

But the more significant point is they didn't have to do it. There was no gun to their (Houston’s) head. || All supermaxes are created equal and they will all ruin their franchises future. if Ant signs a massive deal it’s going to turn out just as bad if not worse than Chandler Parsons to Dallas. I think many people overrate Ant as a talent and don’t talk enough a lot how much of a liability he is mentally. he’s not mature at all and will cause the downfall of the Wolves, if not the whole league || I'd care more about their financial situations if it was like 30k Vs a million dollars. The fact that moody on the cheap cause nobody wants him is 161 times as much as the average worker in California doesn't have me putting much thought into his financial wellbeing || You skipped the part where they can trade him as he has a lower cap hit. That is the value. Green won’t be “bad” he’s proven he’s a quality player. 


His bad range is if he falls into the Deangelo Russell type of player. He has value but he can’t truly contribute to winning because of his size, defense and difficult shot diet. 


In this scenario DLo is valuable to the Lakers as a building piece for a trade because his contract is movable. DLo also opted in but because of his contract size it was not harmful for the Lakers. He can still be moved. 


By the time Green will be opt out eligible the salary cap will have increased by an estimated 30%. Which makes this deal very much in the neighborhood of DLo’s cap hit. || To the second point Houston locked him in to a significantly smaller dollar amount. That allowed them to sign Sengun and still gives them cap flexibility for the next two summers. If they wait and Green plays well then they have to give him a much larger deal and that could potentially put them in a precarious cap situation with Jabari Smith Jr coming up soon as well. 


IMO it made sense for both. Houston wanted more cap flexibility and Jalen Green wanted to control his destiny sooner rather than later. || Not true. After signing his rookie extension he would be eligible for UFA. There isn’t a set number of years for RFA. It’s simply your first contract after your rookie deal. 

He signed an extension. That extension did not include a team option. It is a player option. It is impossible to have a player option for that player to opt into a RFA summer. || There's only been 6 supermaxes signed so far and I'd say the Warriors are happy with Steph and the Bucks with Giannis.  Harden and Westbrook's teams were happy until the players left without a ring.  Wall got injured that's just bad luck.  Gobert is the only one that is arguably overpaid for their prime value.

Ant has the potential to be the best player in the league.  Also the potential to be one of the biggest ticket draws in the league.  Likeable uber athletes that have gotten better every season and have risen under pressure in the playoffs are an absolute no brainer.  Plus he has so much room to grow in this offense.  Dude is just a chucker now.  Literally just chucked 13 3's per game thats more than any Steph season who tops at 11.  That's nuts.  He blow by anyone, dunk on anyone, massive improvement in defense.

Mental liability?  Because he jokes around about going to the NFL?  What? || Umm. This took a strange turn. I hope Ant doesn't sign a massive deal and then his immaturity causes the downfall of the entirety league 😂. || I truly do not care, I'm pointing out that it's inconsistent with the approach from both NBA and NBPA and that at the end it's benefitial for fan too || I mean I didn't skip it, It's right there in my final sentence in the post you replied.

I understand, the problem is:

A) Every team knows this. That's also why the Lakers can't move DLo. You can't say, either out loud or through actions ""Hey this player is not so good, I want to get rid of him"" and then turn around and say to the other 29 teams ""Who wants this player, he's really good"". This makes him maybe more tradeable if we're talking about the cap hit, but less tradeable if you need to sit down with someone and negotiate.

B) Why the player option?  If I'm desperate enough to trade for him, I'm making a bet. Why give HIM insurance instead of the team that's betting on him? That lowers the trade value too. || > His bad range is if he falls into the Deangelo Russell type of player. He has value but he can’t truly contribute to winning because of his size, defense and difficult shot diet.

You are way higher than I am if you think DLo is his bad range. DLo creates for others and has much better shooting splits. 18/6 with 46/41/83 shooting over the past two seasons. 

> In this scenario DLo is valuable to the Lakers as a building piece for a trade because his contract is movable. DLo also opted in but because of his contract size it was not harmful for the Lakers. He can still be moved.

DLo also makes about half per year that Green makes and the Lakers have been trying to trade him pretty much since they got him. 

> By the time Green will be opt out eligible the salary cap will have increased by an estimated 30%. Which makes this deal very much in the neighborhood of DLo’s cap hit.

Nope. DLo's contract right now is 13% of the cap. For the 26-27 season (2nd or 3 years on the contract), Green's number will be just over 21% of the cap. 

Dlo is on a 2y36MM total deal - so $18M AAV. Green's is 3y105MM, so 36MM AAV. His 2nd year is 36MM, which is the full value of DLo's 2y contract. || he’s mentally unstable because he’s a raging homophobe || it likely will || Lakers can absolutely move DLo. They are wanting to move DLo for a specific piece that is insanely hard to find. The issue isn’t moving DLo is the overall poor construction of the Lakers roster. 


DLo was traded for Wiggins just a few seasons ago to complete the Warriors championship run. DLo at that time was roughly the same age as Green would be.

Edit B) it’s a negotiation. Houston asked for less cap restrictions long term in case Green underperforms. Green’s camp countered with the player option sooner if he exceeds the contract. IMO that is successful negotiation on both ends. The team that trades for him can simply ask him to opt in and extend. However not every team will want him as a player but as a contract. Even if he opts in to the final year he’s an expiring deal that has value. || I am high on Green still. DLo is 6yrs older than Green and his breakout season wasn’t until his 22yr old season. 

Which Green is entering now. Comparing DLo year 3 to Green year 3: 


Green averaged 19.6 on 42.3% and 33% from 3. He averaged 5.2 Rebs and 5.2 assists 

DLo: 15.5 on 41% FG and 32% from 3. 3.9 rebs and 5.2 assists. 

So yes at the same stage of their career both being #2 overall picks they are very similar. 

Do the same thing with their contracts. Green deal is signed today so it is larger. However the entire NBA knows that the salary cap is going to rise by approximately 10% per year for duration of this CBA. So when Green’s contract reaches the final year it will be roughly the same value as DLo’s as a % of the overall cap. % of cap matters much more to teams then the overall dollar amount. || >Lakers can absolutely move DLo. They are wanting to move DLo for a specific piece that is insanely hard to find. The issue isn’t moving DLo is the overall poor construction of the Lakers roster.

If DLo is still on the Lakers if because, they can't though. The mismatch between the Lakers potential return for DLo and the price that the market places on DLo, is the same dynamic that would apply to Jalen Green. If Houston wants 3 FRPs (just making stuff up, not really a realistic ask) for Green and the other teams want to give you 1, then you actually can't move him, isn't it? That's my point about the percieved value Green has around the league. The Rockets are signaling ""yes, I also think he's not that good"", so they won't be able to get a great return for him. I'm not saying they'll dump him but, his value objectively decreases.

Rockets might be more open than the lakers to get different players, the problem is not variety, is quality.

>DLo was traded for Wiggins just a few seasons ago to complete the Warriors championship run. DLo at that time was roughly the same age as Green would be.

DLo was not even going to be re-signed by Brooklyn, so, Nets didn't want him

Warriors got him via S&T because Brooklyn preferred those assets instead of just losing him in FA for nothing. Warriors though, wanted him because they stroke out with other FAs at the time, and wanted to use him later as a trade filler.

Wolves got him because A) Were desperate to unload Wiggins and B) KAT asked for him for years because they are friends.

Lakers got him because A) Wanted to get rid of Russ and B) Needed what Vando and Beasley provided.

Every FO eventually wants to trade DLo. Every fan in each of these teams eventually wants the FO to trade DLo. If that's Green's value then It's not good.

EDIT: And even if we disagree on this, I still don't understand the player option -at all-. || >  Green deal is signed today so it is larger. 

You are completely ignoring that I put what percentage of the cap it is expected to be year by year. 

> Green averaged 19.6 on 42.3% and 33% from 3. He averaged 5.2 Rebs and 5.2 assists

> DLo: 15.5 on 41% FG and 32% from 3. 3.9 rebs and 5.2 assists.

You messed up Green's assists in Green's favor and also didn't mention that DLo's year had some injury issues and had his career low from 3, which is about Jalen's average mark. The following year DLo was an All Star and put up 21/7 in just 30mpg.  


> However the entire NBA knows that the salary cap is going to rise by approximately 10% per year for duration of this CBA. So when Green’s contract reaches the final year it will be **roughly the same value as DLo’s as a % of the overall cap.** 

This is not remotely true and the post you replied to literally had the percentage of the cap that each contract would be. DLo is currently about 13% of the cap. In the 2nd year of his contract, Green will be just over 21% of the cap. All of that information was in the previous post. 

> % of cap matters much more to teams then the overall dollar amount.

Yes, which is why I included it and for some reason you ignored that and continued to say that DLo's contract and Green's contract would be about the same percentage of the cap, which has already been proven false. || So the last 2 options I agree with and that is my point. Wiggins was an under performing player on a big deal that they wanted to get rid of. DLo contract facilitated that trade. Wiggins was more valuable to the Warriors than he was to Minnesota. 


Minnesota saw DLo as a smaller and shorter contract that can be moved later. Which they did. 

DLo was an upgrade from Westbrook’s bad contract. 


I’m saying very simply these deals happen all the time. Jordan Poole for Chris Paul. Having a young player on a shorter deal that is less than current max money is an asset from a cap and future trade scenario. 


If Green significantly outplays this deal then he has also likely met the requirements to receive a super max. Which Houston can pay him more than anyone else. 


The player option is Green’s team being good at negotiating. I think you are viewing it as Houston has to win every single aspect of the deal for it to be a success. I simply disagree. Giving Green the player option is a concession for him locking into the agreement at the time he did. 


The Rockets immediately signed Sengun deal and now they go into the season with their cap figured out. They don’t have to worry about Green having a breakout year and how that will impact them hitting 1st or 2nd aprons next offseason. Now if they want or need to trade Van Vleet, Brooks or one of the younger guys there is significantly less cap ambiguity heading into the 2025 offseason because they did their work early. 


Giving Green the player option most likely was the hurdle that got the deal signed. Now they go into this season with their cap situation largely known. If it makes sense to make a big in season trade it is much easier to do with this deal finalized. 

Tl:Dr the player option was the concession Houston gave up to solidify their cap situation. || I’m discussing DLo’s extension after his rookie deal. The most recent extension is his 3rd contract. Green hasn’t gotten to his third contract so comparing apples to apples. 

You can use whichever year of DLo’s and Green’s as you want. I believe they at the same age were similar players. Nit picking averages off by a bit I’m not concerned with.


Yes I left off DLo’s 4th year as an all star because Green hasn’t gotten the opportunity to play his 4th year. That is my point. DLo had 3 fairly mediocre seasons then had a breakout year. Green has had 3 mediocre seasons. If he also breaks out in a similar way then they are trending very similarly. 


Rather you have DLo or Green as slightly better at this age I’m not arguing. I’m only arguing the “slightly” I’m also only comparing DLo’s rookie extension to Green’s rookie extension. I’m looking at them specifically at GM 0 of year 4. || No but

* Brooklyn got an ok return for a player that was already lost. Warriors saved them, It was not good strategy
* Warriors got Wiggins in return. A) Wiggnins was a net negative player, a consensus between anyone that watched basketball. Zero chance Warriors thought that ahead and B) Wolves wanted DLo for reasons that had nothing to do with DLo's market value
* Wolves got Conley (ok) NAW (another player with negative reviews all around) and 3 2nd rounds, all because they acted as the third team that helped unload Russ.

My point is, this are 3 VERY particular situations, which were not planned at all, and are not replicable. I can't think of any other player that was dealt like DLo across his career. Also Green is making 30+ so somebody out there has to -want him-, and if the return is a mediocre pick and a filler.... I don't think that's good for Houston.

>The player option is Green’s team being good at negotiating. I think you are viewing it as Houston has to win every single aspect of the deal for it to be a success. I simply disagree. Giving Green the player option is a concession for him locking into the agreement at the time he did.

Apparently a great one since the Rockets didn't win a single thing in this negotiation. That's my point.  Houston doesn't want him, so they sign him to a 2+1 at a sus salary. That's not good at all.

> They don’t have to worry about Green having a breakout year and how that will impact them hitting 1st or 2nd aprons next offseason

Well this is kinda my point, you are either in, or out. You think he'll be a star? give him the extension. You think he won't? Negotiate a deal that makes sense, not this one. This one is, again, i f you're good I'm going to have to work to retain you, and pay more than I would have,  and if you're bad I'm going to have trouble dealing you. If the Rockets are so sure Green is not going to be a part of the team, look for an S&T or let him walk. It's Houston, not Utah. They can get FAs if the team is good enough.

>Giving Green the player option most likely was the hurdle that got the deal signed. Now they go into this season with their cap situation largely known. If it makes sense to make a big in season trade it is much easier to do with this deal finalized.

Nehh I don't think so, who was waiting for Green to leave Houston so they could sign him to a better contract than this? If he doesn't have other suitors, where is he going? || > I’m discussing DLo’s extension after his rookie deal. The most recent extension is his 3rd contract. Green hasn’t gotten to his third contract so comparing apples to apples.

Ok, then that's fine. Everyone thought DLo was way overpaid, so I don't think that is a great metric, especially when the cap rules have changed so drastically. 

But the problem is you were very clearly talking about DLo's contract RIGHT NOW and how he opted in with the Lakers, something that did not happen on his second contract. 

This is very clearly DLo's current contract, not his second contract. 

Your quote: 

> In this scenario DLo is valuable to the Lakers as a building piece for a trade because his contract is movable. **DLo also opted in but because of his contract size it was not harmful for the Lakers.** He can still be moved.

-------------

moving forward: 

> You can use whichever year of DLo’s and Green’s as you want. I believe they at the same age were similar players. Nit picking averages off by a bit I’m not concerned with.

I'm not nit picking at all. A 3apg guard and a 5apg guard are two VERY different players. 

> That is my point. DLo had 3 fairly mediocre seasons then had a breakout year. Green has had 3 mediocre seasons. If he also breaks out in a similar way then they are trending very similarly.

I think they showed they have similar weaknesses in their low-IQ, bad shot selection, and lack of defense, but  DLo also showed more passing chops. DLo was also sharing minutes with Kobe, Jordan Clarkson, Lou Williams, and Nick Young. 

> I’m also only comparing DLo’s rookie extension to Green’s rookie extension. I’m looking at them specifically at GM 0 of year 4.

Thanks for clearing that up. You referring to DLo opting into his contract this year certainly was misleading, in that case. 

----------------

I think it is more appropriate to look at the contracts signed in the similar time period rather than find one signed 6 years ago to compare to. 

For instance, Devin Vassell signed a deal that was 27MM/year average a year ago. Devin is a better defender, is bigger, a more efficient shooter, a better passer, and a more efficient driver, posting a top 10 FG% on drives last year for players with a minimum of 8drives/game. Green will make $9M more than Devin on average. That $9M-12M range gets you a quality rotation player like Kelly Oubre, Chris Paul or Steven Adams. 

Jaden McDaniels is a SF D&3ish guy he was at 26M/year. 

DeJounte Murray signed a 4y deal at 28MM average per year. Obviously not coming off a rookie contract, but definitely a more proven player. Josh Hart is at 4y80M. Like DJM, not a rookie. 

Brunson's 3rd contract starts next year at 39M. Green is at 36. Derrick White's starts at 30M. Jalen Johnson is at 30M, Trey Murphy is at 28M. 

Just looking at the other extensions on 2nd and 3rd contracts, 36M/year average is wildly out of line for Jalen Green. He's not there, and the BBIQ thing usually isn't something that just turns on a few years into the career. Maybe he can really develop himself and become a DLo level player, but he's a long way away from that, and I don't think that's a good thing. Especially for a guy eating up 21% of the cap. || Let’s simplify the conversation and draw basic conclusions either we agree or we don’t. 

1. Houston doesn’t want him? I disagree. If Houston didn’t want him they don’t extend him and allow him to walk. I believe that Houston VALUES him at the rate of a player drafted outside the lottery now. 


2. I believe Jalen Green is an above average player in the NBA. Specifically he is a top 175 player. He has a market and isn’t close to being out the league. 


3. I believe that every off season there are “untradeable” contracts and players traded. Happens every offseason. 



4. What I or the internet etc determine is “good value” or a better player is largely hyperbole and over reaction. The vast majority of players given a different scenario would have a different outcome. PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford proved that. Malik Monk, Wiggins etc. Therefore I believe that Jalen Green can be traded for a piece that COMPLIMENTS the overall team in a better way. That is the biggest thing in a trade is the environment and situation they are put in. This is true for the majority of the NBA and there are few outlier. 



5. Houston did this deal because Green is 22 and hyper athletic with skill. If he blossoms then they have his bird rights and can pay him. If he flops there is enough flexibility to move him. || 1. If Houston wants him, they lock him up the max amount of years, with the best contract framework available. This is not what happenned.
2. I agree, I didn't say he'll be out of the league. My problem with Green is first my personal opinion, he's a scorer, not a very effective one from 2 or 3, doesn't defend well, doesn't move the ball around a lot, I can't see him as a number one option anywhere and doesn't seem to have the skills to be anything else other than scoring off the bench (and for that, he'd be overpaid) And second, his own team doesn't look like they like him a lot either (see above)
3. All contracts are tradeable, sure, but because one team ends up losing to make the trade happen. If Houston moves Green and accepts a meh return, I'll point to my previous comments about this contract not being benefitial to Houston.
4. This point has so many aspects to cover:
   1. PJ and Gafford were traded for a FRP. Both Washington an Charlotte, needed those picks to help with rebuilding
   2. If Houston wants a role player like those, a good solid role player, most likely their team is going to want a FRP, that's like the universal value of players in that bracket. And other teams pay that willingly.
   3. I already spoke about how (my opinion) Jalen Green is not a good fit basically anywhere because with his skill set he should be the #1 option but he's not good enough.
   4. So, in order to make this trade happen you would need a team that chooses not to have a FRP (because, they totally could, anyone would pay that) and instead bet on a player that's being traded by the team that drafted him, for a role player (!), and bet on the fact that a new situation would let him develop properly, properly being he can be a part of your team and not be the #1 guy (because there's zero chance a team right now trades for Green and hands him the keys to the team). And if It doesn't work you're going to have a lot of trouble getting rid of him before those 3 years pass because you'd be the second team that doesn't want him.
5. I see a 22 year old that's raw as hell, entering his -fourth- season. I'm not saying he can be great for the next decade, I'm just going with what I see right now. And this might be Houston's fault for sure, but If you search posts on here or old articles, you can see that pretty much he's at the same point he was when he was drafted. People have the same doubts, he has the same holes in his game. Hell his 3P% has decreased every year.

EDIT: I had a hunch and went to [nbadraft.net](http://nbadraft.net) to see the NBA comp for Green before the draft: LaVine and Beal. That's just PERFECT and illustrates what I've been saying.

Jalen Brunson,"""Jalen Brunson"" OR ""Jalen"" OR ""Jalen Dime"" OR ""Brunson""",2024-10-28,nbadiscussion,1gewwrs,"An ode to Memphis super-subs Jay Huff and Scotty Pippen Jr.
","When I decided to write something about Memphis to start the season, I assumed it would be something about Ja Morant (looking no less athletic than the last time we saw him, even if he can’t hit a jumper), or Desmond Bane, or rookie giant Zach Edey, or the return of Jaren Jackson Jr. to his proper role as a weakside shotblocking menace.

And I will almost certainly touch upon some of those storylines in the future. But today? Today belongs to Jay Huff and Scotty Pippen Jr.

If you haven’t heard of Huff, I don’t blame you. The 26-year-old had logged a combined 31 NBA games and 164 minutes before this season. My earliest memory of the bearded one is watching [Shaedon Sharpe atomize him at Summer League](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkh8VOjImeA) a few seasons ago — the TV broadcast proclaiming, “Huff does have the ability to protect the rim” right before he gets baptized is perfect comedic timing.

But the announcers weren’t wrong. Huff was the 2023 G-League Defensive Player of the Year, averaging 3.1 blocks per game that season, and that’s shone to start the season. Huff looks like a guy who wears flannel to work and enjoys hazy IPAs, not like someone with the length and quickness to recover and block a full-speed Jalen Green: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/an-ode-to-memphis-super-subs-jay)\]

In his short NBA career, Huff has averaged 2.3 blocks per 36 minutes — an excellent mark. He’s even shown a little agility on the perimeter, although a larger sample is needed to see if that’s sustainable.

While Huff has long been a good defender, it’s his offense that has popped off the screen through four games. Huff has shown off his athleticism with an array of reverse dunks (he *loves* reverse dunks): \[[clip here\]](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/an-ode-to-memphis-super-subs-jay)

Want another? Here’s my favorite. Huff makes a beautifully timed cut and then *reverse dunks on two people*: \[[dope clip here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/an-ode-to-memphis-super-subs-jay)\]

That slam got virtually no acclaim, which is tragic. Reversing on top of defenders is like an eclipse on Leap Day; you just don’t see it much.

As exciting as his handful of jams have been, Huff’s range has been even more critical. Huff has been lights out from three, canning 10 of his 17 attempts through the season so far. Huff shot 37% from deep in the G-League last year and 40% the year before, so low volume caveats aside, this isn’t *completely* unexpected. His comfort level with the ball is notable: \[[clip here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/an-ode-to-memphis-super-subs-jay)\]

How does a guy who can protect the rim and space the floor need four summer leagues and three years in the G to get his literal shot in the big leagues? That’s a better question for NBA team executives than me. We still don’t know if his rebounding or ability to guard in space will hold up over time, but Huff couldn’t be off to a better start. His ability to stretch the floor without sacrificing defense has given Memphis a nice curveball to the old-school Edey (and might make for an intriguing paint Drano for Morant as the season goes on).

It’s also allowed Memphis to try some funky combinations, including a three-big lineup with Santi Aldama (a fellow super-sub who has been thrust into a starting role in three of four games this season; he has been a story all his own) and Brandon Clarke. What fun!

Huff’s minutes have been an early joy of the season so far, and Memphis just rewarded him by [converting his two-way deal into a guaranteed contract](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/grizzlies/2024/10/28/jay-huff-contract-memphis-grizzlies-roster/75903057007/) (yay!). But he’s not the only Memphis vagabond to make the most of his time. Scotty Pippen Jr. (yes, the son of *that* Scottie Pippen) has put in work as the backup point guard after bouncing around on two-ways for a few years like an unloved pinball.

Pippen, a favorite of mine since his days at Vanderbilt University, has consistently combined ferocious on-ball defense, deadeye shooting, and burgeoning playmaking with the new confidence that [only his own guaranteed contract](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/grizzlies-convert-scotty-pippen-jr-to-guaranteed-contract-he-will-back-up-ja-morant/ar-AA1snGdF?ocid=BingNewsSerp) can bring. In fact, Pippen’s 8.3 assists per game rank fourth in the NBA, and he’s doing it in just 25 minutes per night!

Pippen’s game, in a nutshell, can be summed up by this backcourt steal and dish to a trailing Huff for a triple: \[[clip here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/an-ode-to-memphis-super-subs-jay)\]

That aggressive mentality pays off in the half-court offense, too. Pippen drives into the paint nearly 11 times per game and [leads the league in assists off those forays](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives?CF=DRIVES*GE*10&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&dir=D&sort=DRIVE_AST_PCT). His ability to collapse the paint and kick out for triples kept Memphis’ offense afloat even as Morant, Jackson, and others have missed games and played limited minutes.

Sometimes, that confidence can lead to some oopsies. Pippen isn’t a big dude (6’1” on [Giving Tuesday](https://apnews.com/article/what-is-giving-tuesday-when-is-giving-tuesday-nonprofit-donations-b8354714abe53e8734524e9cea02bb43)) and can run out of passing lanes when audacity overwhelms caution: \[[clip here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/an-ode-to-memphis-super-subs-jay)\]

But Pippen is putting up playmaking numbers rivaling almost any guard in the league (including a 12-assist game in a big win against Orlando and a 10-assist effort last night), and he should only get better with more experience running the show. For the Grizzlies to find him essentially off the scrap heap last season feels like cheating.

When the Bears ripped off back-to-back second seeds in 2022 and 2023, depth was a huge key to their success. They’re banking on that this year, too. The Grizzlies have a brutal schedule to open the season with six games in just nine days, and after last year’s injury-ravaged horror-film of a season, coach Taylor Jenkins stated early on that Memphis would manage the starters’ minutes. That’s led to increased room for the reserves to play well and earn confidence.

And although the Grizzlies suffered a late-game collapse in Chicago without Ja Morant last night, they’re still 2-2, with two matches against Brooklyn sandwiching games against a struggling Milwaukee squad and an uncertain, nervous Philadelphia team. If they can make it through this opening stretch at 4-4 or 5-3 without needing to open up the throttle, that’s a massive win for their long-term outlook.

Eventually, the schedule will stabilize, and the starters will assume a bigger role (I won’t shed tears for Jake LaRavia’s minutes ticking down). Pippen won’t be a top-five assist guy forever, sadly, and Huff will probably miss a three-pointer at some point. But the two have shown that they’re ready and able to assume as large a workload as necessary, and that’s far more important for the Grizzlies than most.",98,13,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1gewwrs/an_ode_to_memphis_supersubs_jay_huff_and_scotty/,2024-10-29 11:09:28,"Really enjoyed this post, been high on pippen myself for a while.

Jalen Brunson,"""Jalen Brunson"" OR ""Jalen"" OR ""Jalen Dime"" OR ""Brunson""",2024-10-28,nbadiscussion,1gedja3,If the Suns disappoint this year I see Devin Booker getting traded to the Rockets ,"I personally am not to high on the Suns this year. I think their team is good but I feel like there are to many teams that I would pick above them (plus there is Durant’s worsening health in the past 5 seasons which could hurt them if he’s out for a 10-15 game window) I feel like Booker might want to ask out if the Suns are not a top 4 seed and get bounced in the first round. If he does the Rockets would be the perfect team to trade for him.

In terms of young talent, the Rockets have 

AP

Jalen Green

Jabari Smith Jr

Amen Thompson 

Tari Eason 

Reed Sheppard 

Also when you add the fact that AP and VanVleet are locks to start they don’t have minutes for all of these guys to develop which means they might want to cash in some of these young players for an established top 15 player in the league like Booker. However, the real factor as to why I think the rockets would want to do this is because they elected to trade the picks they got for Harden back to Brooklyn in exchange for the picks that the Nets got in the Durant trade. I personally feel like the Rockets were planning for this because why would you trade the nets picks when they look like a lottery team for the next 4 years. If you have the Suns picks, you have all the leverage in the trade if you want to get Booker since they need their picks back if they trade Booker and go into a rebuild.

My personal mock trade would look something like this:

Rockets get Devin Booker 

Suns get their picks back, Jalen Green, Tari Eason, and one of Reed Shepard or Amen Thomson 

 Would love some feedback on this mock trade and your overall thoughts on the Suns as a team in the comments ",0,41,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1gedja3/if_the_suns_disappoint_this_year_i_see_devin/,2024-10-28 17:20:24,"They’ll trade KD before they trade booker and I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s on the move by the deadline if they’re under performing. It’s their own fault for making the Beal trade that was a terrible move || Suns owner has mentioned always competing each year, they may not be built for a title, but I don’t see him trading their best player who is still under 30 just for picks they were willing to give up less than two years ago, also while it’s not impossible book has never seemed like someone wanting to leave Phoenix || I'm sorry but this trade proposal is laughable. Booker put up with the Suns being awful for years - it's not likely he wants out. And unless he wants out, he's not getting traded. And if he is getting trades, the Suns would need to get A LOT more than that. || KD to Houston for the same reasons makes more sense for both parties. 

Jabari Smith + Van Vleet or Brooks and Suns pick(s). 
Can add Eason as well. A swap in 2026 or 2027 can also be navigated. 

Jabari has been underperforming. The Rockets need scoring and shooting around their young talent. KD slots in without really impacting the young guys. 


If Reed Sheppard Jalen Green or Amen Thompson really show promise in the first half of the season this really makes sense. If it’s Thompson you move Brooks. If it’s Sheppard you move Van Vleet. 


Phoenix needs defending and PG play. They can address whichever one with this trade. They acquire a young guy that may simply need a different development environment in Smith Jr and they don’t abort their future around Booker. 


KD instantly makes Houston a dangerous playoff team with his experience and late game shot making. He also helps provide additional spacing || Very unlikely, they’d move KD first. Book is still a great young player that most teams would be happy to pay a max to. You don’t trade that kind of an asset away unless you are embracing a complete rebuild and I don’t think the Suns leadership wants that nor is it the best strategic choice over the near-to-mid term. || As long as they have booker they are gonna make the playoffs which is the organizations goal, so they will trade KD retool around Booker and play for playoffs till Beal is off the payroll || I'm not as sure on the destination, but I agree that if the Suns decide to reset they will trade Booker, simply because Beal won't get them a lot at all (they probably have to pay) and KD is at a point where it will be very few buyers. || Your trade is too rich for the Rockets to accept, imo. Jalen, Brooks & their picks back is probably fair value, but yeah, they might be able to get one more prospect. But 2 more (3 total)? Booker isn't that level of superstar. You're talking Giannis-level returns.

All this said, I'd bet they'd move KD before Book. A deal like AlP + picks + filler for KD should get it done. || The rockets would never in a trillion gazillion years do this and you’re on crack for suggesting it and the rules are my comment had to be 75 characters long so these extra words are to meet that criteria || The Suns have to decide whether to extend KD or let him reach free agency in summer 2026. Given how much they have given up for him it would seem an extension is gonna be offered. Suns are all-in over the second apron and limited draft picks. || Can’t stand Booker, but as a Wolves fan I’m so sick of posts all over like this. People dreaming about getting other teams top players because their organization can’t develop top end talent. I see posts all the time about how Ant will be in LA, NY, MIA and every other big market. People who think like that are pathetic. || Beginning of December, Rockets should be patient and wait till next season. They can potentially land KD + Harden while keeping Amen Thomson and Eason. They need their D. Thomson can guard 1 to 4 and Rockets are not moving him for Booker. || Rockets won't trade Green or Thompson.  I don't even think they will let Shepard go.  I think a more realistic trade will be VanVleet, Eason, and picks. || I think Green+picks+salary filler is enough for Booker if the Suns are ready to tank. The only reason to trade him is if they want to go for the lottery balls, and in that case, the Rockets with the picks have all the leverege in the world.

I like the Shepard-Booker-Thimpson-Smith-Sengun starting five for the next 5-7 years, that looks like a good to great core, even in a strong west competing with OKC, Wemby, Luka and Ant. || If their title hopes look gone, they should just go ahead and trade both. A trade like the one suggested with the Rockets + what you could get for KD on the market would set them up for a quick rebuild that would only need 1-2 seasons of tanking to turn it around. || Can u give the alternatives to not trading for beal? 1. Cut cp3 and get 5 million dollar mle 2.eat cp3s final year and then 5 million dollar mle 3. Jordan Poole…those were the options. || I mean what OP mentioned would make sense if the Suns start to suck for KD. || > They’ll trade KD before they trade booker

I agree they will want to trade KD. But KD is 36 with a history of major injuries. Unless I think getting KD can be like getting Kawhi on the 2019 Raptors, I am very hesitant to pull the trigger as another GM at this point. And even then, would anyone give up anything near what Phoenix did? || I actually think KD would have a huge amount of interested buyers. He’s at the point now where his age is detracting from his market value and as such teams that are on the brink of contention wouldn’t have to gut their whole roster to get him. Im not saying all these teams have the assets or cap for him but I could see Atlanta, Cleveland, Indiana, Orlando, Miami, OKC, GSW, Bucks, Twolves and maybe even Nola all taking a swing at getting him. || That would be a good deal for them. Didn’t the rockets end up with a better record without AlP when he was injured last year (could have sworn I read that somewhere) || I feel like they would need to add one more piece. One of Eason, Sheppard, or Thompson just because nobody knows how to evaluate a players value after the Knicks traded 5 firsts for Mikal Bridges || In a pure basketball sense yes absolutely, but factoring in the other aspects of the nba I'd be shocked if they trade Booker. Firstly he obviously has in mind the Kobe thing of winning one for the team that drafted him and Booker on the suns = jersey sales, they'd be sacrificing a lotttt of money to give up on him. I would imagine they trade KD for a semi competitive package, see if the quick retooling can turn them into something, give it another season and if by then they're still on a downward trajectory Booker will probably ask out and get the Dame/Wall treatment where the fans still like him and the suns || Chris Paul’s money was non-guaranteed so you wouldn’t have had to pay him the full 30 mil. And he was on the final year of his deal. The right choice was ride out his final year and then get him off the books, there was no need to trade for the one of the top 10 worst contract in the nba || I think we can all agree Booker > KD in terms of desirability because of your reasoning. Yes KD is better but Sun prefer to keep Booker but other teams prefer to take Booker || Oh they wouldn't get anything close to what they traded for him in return, it'd be a move for depth and cap space. As for why another gm would want him? Well come on he's old but it's Kevin Durant, he'll win you playoff games. If you're in the ""almost but not quite"" category, teams would definitely take a swing at it, especially since his market value is nowhere near his value on court (given that he's in a situation with a good fit).

The other benefit is because the market for KD has shrank significantly and because Phoenix is in the shit right now, teams know they could underpay for KD. I mean there could be a world where KD is on the Bucks in exchange for Middleton, Lopez and a couple picks for example || Add Houston to that list.  
(And they're the ones that matter most) || Yup. Plus, Udoka doesn't use SengÜn appropriately and seems to desire a defensive center. So it would be best for both parties if Houston moved on from him. || Maybe Eason, he is nowhere near as valuable as Amen or Shepard at this point. But my point is, if the Suns trade away Booker (that means Beal and KD is going too), their 3 own picks is far more valuable than 5 or 7 from a contedner/stable palyoff team, that would trade for Booker. || I see where you are coming from, but I do think things like jersey sales are a bit overrated of a factor in these decisions by fans. The extra value you add to a team that wins championships/has deep playoff runs consistently more over a long period is in the hundreds of millions or billions. 

An NBA team gets a less than 50% cut of the revenue from a jersey sale of a player on their team so a team like the Suns is probably only pulling in numbers in the single digits millions or low 10s of millions a year from the extra revenue someone like Booker brings. 

I think the more plausible answer is the owners are just a little stubborn and don’t want to admit defeat/own a team that doesn’t have any stars and is going to be bad for an unknown amount of time. It’s a losing strategy long term most the time but plenty of owners in all the major sports seem to act irrationally about their teams. || N then sign who for an mle whos is better than beal? Meanwhile they sign tyus on a min anyways and get the steal of the draft in Ryan Dunn (which kinda makes OPs point mute now). 

Beal was the 2nd highest 3rd scorer in the nba last year. His counting numbers were right on par with Jalen Williams. N his defense to start the year has been real nice. Suns were fine paying a premium they’ve lost nothing so for from it but Landry shamet and Chris Paul n a small mle at most. N they get out of right before the 2nd apron stipulations get real bad

A TL;DR: is at the end, but I recommend skimming **the bold sentences** as you scroll to it if you want to catch the gist and track where the details are.\]   

One of the more impressive turnarounds in the history of the NBA occurred last season, when the Houston Rockets entered Phase 2 of their rebuild. After 3 seasons of winning an average of 20 games, they nearly doubled their win total by posting 41 wins en route to a .500 season. **I’m not going to rehash all the most obvious moves that occurred throughout Phase 1**, like General Manager Rafael Stone’s unprecedented decision to eschew the return of a young prospect when trading away James Harden, opting for unprotected picks instead, or how he loaded 10 of those first round picks over a period of a few years to align the core players’ timelines. I won’t speculate as to how much good fortune had to come for those picks to yield Tari Eason, Reed Sheppard and a bevy of future unprotected Phoenix Suns picks, or how much of a misstep it may have been to take chances on damaged goods in the form of John Wall and Victor Oladipo, and to a different extent, Christian Wood and Kevin Porter Jr. 

The purpose here is to reveal elements of the rebuild that went largely unnoticed or ignored at the time that led to the surprising boost in wins when Houston popped the clutch in the summer of 2023. Not many people foresaw such a complete reversal of fortune occurring, with pre-season expectations for win totals typically hovering in the low 30s. Most fans had long since lost hope that there was any chance at a winning season, with many just wanting to avoid the continued embarrassment of finishing with one of the worst records in the league for a 4^(th) season in a row. 

Those people apparently did not pay attention to Andy Bailey’s calculation that veteran players would add an estimated 19 wins (he was exactly right), or recognize that Stone had designed the rebuild to create this huge leap in wins. Or perhaps they had just lost faith in his ability to do it because they thought he had been trying to win games throughout Phase 1. There is a large amount of confusion regarding what exactly Stone was trying to accomplish during Phase 1 of the rebuild, as many of the largest social media accounts have been questioning whether he had an actual plan,  lambasting him as bumbling cluelessly through the rebuild, making bad decision after bad decision, but somehow stumbling into a perfect confluence of coincidence.

**I’m going to explain the key components of what I believe was a well-executed Plan, a new and improved ‘Process’ for tanking that still allows promising young prospects to get developmental reps. I ask that you weigh it along with the consideration that under no circumstances could Rafael Stone admit to taking some of the extreme steps I’ll suggest he knowingly took, both because it would result in heavy penalties from the NBA and potentially a loss of trust with some of the players. After reading, ask yourself if this interpretation of the Rockets rebuild is truly less likely than the commonly accepted alternative narratives. I believe that Stone’s radical new tanking Plan is not only replicable, but has in fact already been copied by one of the most discerning front offices in the league**. 

Before going into the details of how I believe the Plan unfolded, **let’s establish a basic fact that was ignored or denied by many Rockets fans - that the team was intentionally tanking**. Most of the bloggers and largest accounts on Rockets Twitter subscribed to the belief that the team wasn’t trying to lose… they were just bad.

Of course, Rafael Stone cannot admit to tanking the same way Sam Hinkie openly asked Philly fans to “Trust the Process”. Ever since the 76ers damaged the public perception of the league’s competitiveness standards, Silver has made it clear that any intentional tanking will be punished harshly. The Mavericks caught hell for admitting to tanking a relatively meaningless game at the end of the season to keep their pick. How would Silver react to a team stating they had planned to lose as much as possible for three consecutive seasons? A 7-figure fine would just be a starting point. It could result in the loss of the pick or Stone’s job (*insert .gif of Hinkie nodding solemnly*). But without a smoking gun from the front office saying that the tank was on, many people simply refused to admit that losing enough games to finish with a bottom-three record was an intentional franchise goal.

While this goal was obvious to most folks who followed the NBA over the second half of the 2021 season (even before John Wall called it out the following season), many fans of the franchise did not realize that similar goals were in place for the next 2 years, as well. Perhaps the biggest reason for the lack of recognition was that nobody in the Rockets front office explicitly stated they were tanking in the way that Philadelphia did; so unlike Philly fans, who found a way to cope with the losing, a lot of Houston fans had loftier expectations for their club than a bottom-3 record, and they allowed their frustration at the repeated losing to be vented off with disgust over the product they were watching. This created an avalanche of ill-will towards every level of the franchise on the X platform (particularly in the ‘Spaces’) from fans who were disappointed in the losing and confused by the product they were watching. Make no mistake, **the “embarrassment” label that was emblazoned upon Phase 1 had emerged fully formed from the fanbase years before anyone in the national media smelled the blood in the water and joined into the frenzy**. 

Although Stone had touched vaguely upon his Plan in the summer of 2022 when he stated the expectations were to deliver a huge leap in wins in the 2024 season, **Tilman Fertitta set the record straight** once and for all the following year at the groundbreaking of the new Rockets practice facility (and again more recently following its opening). With the transition to Phase 2, the Rockets’ owner couldn’t help himself, cracking the door open to let fans know **that the “painful” previous 3-years had been planned for quite some time. We learned that the team viewed 30 wins as “basketball purgatory” and saw 20 wins as desirable for drafting high-caliber talent**. Fertitta is a gambler. He understands odds better than most. He had thick enough skin to embrace 3 straight years of being horrible with the knowledge that it gave him the best odds at building a Championship contender. He certainly understood that every percentage point in the odds of drafting Wembanyama was worth millions of dollars. 

Following this statement (admission?), many fans began to revise history, pretending they were aware of this all along, but anyone paying attention to social media throughout Phase 1 probably did not see many of these accounts reminding fans that the losses were to be expected. In fact, losses were often brought up as the primary factor in complaints about the team and coaching staff (feel free to search who used the team’s record against Stephen Silas in their desire to brand him “the worst coach ever” if you want proof they didn’t recognize that losing was an institutional goal). No moment encapsulates how out of touch most of social media was with the team’s goals than their response to a loss to Miami in mid-December of 2022. The team had been playing .500 ball for a month (and was on a pace to hit 30 wins and destroy their chances at a bottom 3 seed), when they lost a game in the final second of play due to a blown coverage by Daishen Nix. 

When Rockets fans are aware the team is actively tanking (or even perceive that tanking would be a good thing under the circumstances), they are very content with close, competitive losses. One could even say they generally root for the loss and not be too far off-base. This scenario typically arises at the end of a season, because that is the traditional time for teams to tank, however, as you’ll soon see, ***Houston had been in tank mode since the pre-season***. The mid-December loss to the Heat set Rockets Twitter ablaze with fury. They had already been disappointed with a lackluster 9-18 record (for what it’s worth, a record that was 5^(th)\-worst in the league at the time), and largely unwilling to acknowledge that the franchise was looking to secure the top draft odds for Victor Wembanyama.

Fans did not recognize how difficult it was to stay within reach of a bottom-3 seed and the top draft odds that came with it. It took extreme measures. Every odd choice coming from the front office and coaching staff was necessary just to stay in the bottom 5 teams. As teams like Utah and Portland can confirm, traditional, late-season turns to tanking are insufficient if a franchise wants to get the best draft odds possible. Even with 3 teams getting equal odds at the top pick, those bottom seeds tend to separate themselves from the many teams contending for the play-in tournament. If a team doesn’t stay within reach of the bottom, they will be unable to get there once they make a shift to true ‘tank lineups’ at the end of the season**. If a team wants to guarantee good odds for the next summer’s draft, they need to make an early commitment to losing before the bottom drops out too far beneath them to catch**. Sometimes that decision is made for a team with an extended losing streak, but occasionally that decision is made before the season even starts. And that appears to be the case in (at least the third year of) Houston’s Phase 1.

Tanking is not easy to do without tipping your hand, though. **A team needs plausible deniability to avoid punishment**. It is important to remember that every player in the NBA is always trying to win the game. Philadelphia went to roster-building extremes that made it clear to everyone watching that they had no intention of winning games by playing a lot of really sub-par players, but they also benefited from their best player being too injured to play. This is how other obvious tanks have been run, recent examples include the Warriors and Thunder losing Steph and SGA for extended stretches, allowing them to get the 2^(nd) overall pick. But you cannot rely upon your best players being injured. And trying to limit their playing time is complicated. There is only so much you can realistically do as a front office. Asking an incredibly talented player to fake an injury so the team can attempt to add another valuable prospect who will threaten his status as the best player on the team is absolutely out of the question. 

Securing the top odds for Wembanyama was going to require something beyond simply hoping Jalen Green, Jabari Smith and Alperen Segun would get injured. Besides, Stone very much needed these young players to be getting reps in the NBA. None of them were the ‘generational’ level of prospect who can step into the pros on day one and contribute to winning (in large part due to their age and body type), so developing them properly to be ready when the team flipped the switch to winning the next year was of critical importance. 

How can a team play their best young players and be relatively certain of losing games? This was the question that Rafael Stone needed an answer to, and I believe he had discovered it the year before when the team was actively tanking for one of Jabari Smith Jr, Chet Holmgren, or Paolo Banchero. **The secret to tanking while letting young stars play and grow is related to the players the team puts in support of the young stars.**

Throughout the 2022 season, Rockets fans bemoaned the fact that veteran players were in the active rotation alongside top picks Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun instead of giving heavy minutes to other rookies like Josh Christopher and Usman Garuba (yes, I realize Garuba spent most of this season injured, but that didn’t stop fans from blaming Silas for not giving him enough playing time). 

While fans hopefully recognize the immense value veterans provide after adding them for Phase 2, many fans were begging to see Josh Christopher play in place of Eric Gordon during Phase 1. What these fans did not realize at the time was how important it is to have good role models on the floor who know how to play the game. The veteran players helped keep games from becoming absolute blowouts in the 2022 season. Blowout losses do not offer the same valuable learning opportunities that closer games do, because when the other team is playing 3^(rd) string players for the 2^(nd) half after their starters easily coast to a big lead, the game no longer represents standard NBA competitiveness, and consequently provides less of a true ‘learning’ experience - they are wasted minutes more representative of a G-League game than an NBA game.

Yes, **veteran players are critical in a young player’s development, but they also have a strong impact on a team's ability to win games.** However the majority of Rockets fans on Twitter felt their presence served no purpose whatsoever. That may be why they didn’t notice when the veteran players started getting systematically removed from the lineup once the team started playing well and had a stretch of games on the schedule against other bad teams to whom it would be beneficial to lose. Since they were so happy to see the young players get minutes, and wildly overrated their impact on winning NBA games, **many fans ignored the loss of value the vets provided once they were no longer in the rotation**. As the product on the court got increasingly worse, fans blamed the coach instead of recognizing that the lost value the veterans had been providing was the larger culprit.

Margins between winning and losing are thinner than ever in the NBA; particularly in this current age of parity when an immense amount of talent exists in the league. **A team does not need to go to the extreme that the Sixers did to greatly increase their odds of losing games. It isn’t critical to play entire lineups of G-Leaguers - simply having one or two developmental players in the active rotation can be enough to cripple one’s odds of winning**.

It’s no secret that one great player on a roster can have a major impact on the game. The most casual fan knows this to be true of superstars, but even a high-level rookie can have a massive impact (*insert .gif of Chet flexing*). With the current depth in the league allowing teams to put an entire rotation of quality players on the court, what has been less noticed by fans is how impactful a really bad player can be. Chris Vernon calls the idea, **“Don’t play guys that suck”**, and for as simplistic as it sounds… it’s true. **Playing bad players for serious minutes tends to result in losses**. There are exceptions to the rule, like Harden winning a ton of games when the Rockets were frequently giving minutes to G-Leaguers. But that superstar level of play is what it takes to overcome a sub-par rotation and reliably win games. Anyone who follows the league should recognize that teenagers don’t typically play like superstars consistently, but that was what the young Rockets prospects were required to do to win games with their misfit supporting cast.

Typically, when a team undergoes a rebuild, they maintain a veteran presence in the locker room to help mentor the younger players. These veterans also serve as an extension of the coach on the floor, providing accountability and a level of structure and reliability on the court that can translate to a better environment for ‘winning basketball’ than a rotation full of 1^(st) and 2^(nd) year players. Occasionally, one of these supporting veteran role players can even have a hot night and play a big part in delivering a win. 

But what if a team has no interest in winning games? **I strongly feel that Stone’s expulsion of veteran guidance was extreme, targeted, and for the express purpose of losing.** One example of this, John Wall, is well-known. It would seem obvious that removing a former multi-time All-Star and replacing him with a troubled kid carrying emotional baggage and a well-documented history of selfishness wouldn’t be a ‘win-now’ move. But after an off-night from Jrue Holiday in the dog days of the 2021 season resulted in a flukey 51-point outburst from Kevin Porter Jr., the Rockets fanbase somehow convinced themselves that it was an upgrade. The same delusion existed the following year when Christian Wood was dismissed to make room for a teenage draft pick. But even if someone wants to squint very hard and pretend these moves were ‘addition by subtraction’, it’s hard to make the same argument when the players being inserted into the rotation are late-round draft picks or undrafted players from the G-League. And yet Rockets fans, thinking Josh Christopher was Jrue Holiday 2.0, still **found a way to ignore when vets like Daniel Theis and DJ Augustin were taken out of the rotation weeks before the 2022 trade deadline with no injuries to excuse their absence**.

These were quality veteran role players who did their job just a little too well, Theis managed to keep the worst defense in the league just below average while he was playing at the beginning of the 2022 season, and Augustin provided very competent play as a backup point guard, winning a game against Atlanta practically single handedly. **It’s odd to me that Silas would choose to play rookies over these veterans if he were primarily interested in winning games, as the narratives pushed by Rockets social media professed. I feel it’s far more likely that he and Stone were working together to handicap the roster. I’ve frequently equated it to trying to dunk in Timberlands, or swimming with a medicine ball… the team’s potential upside was shackled with a sub-par level of support that dragged down the young stars’ performances**. It’s no different from the standard ‘developmental’ lineups teams traditionally run at the end of the season, removing veterans for G-Leaguers, expanding the rotation to 11 or 12 men… heck, they even tried to bench their best player. Unfortunately, Rockets fans thought the G-Leaguers were budding stars, so they couldn’t recognize the tank was on. Even with Silas proclaiming the rotations were “experimental” and temporary. Which they were. By March, 2023 (coincidentally right after Charlotte went on a 5-game winning streak that locked up a bottom-3 record for Houston), the Rockets finally started running consistent, 9-man rotations for the first time. They went 9-11 over the last 20 games, including big wins over both Finals teams (and no, neither Denver and Boston were taking it easy, both teams were healthy and in tight seeding battles). I suspect this is much closer to what the team would have looked like had Silas used normal rotations all season long, resulting in 30-something wins; a range we now know was considered “purgatory” by management. 

**It seems clear to me that Silas was almost certainly making lineup decisions based on the front office’s wishes**. In a local radio interview following Chris Mannix’s foray into questioning why John Wall wasn’t playing, Silas revealed that it was Stone who wanted KPJ to play point guard and that Fertitta had paid John to go away so the young guards learn by making mistakes (please remember this, there will be more on this point to come when we talk about development). Fans long felt that Silas played KPJ because he was enamored by him, but this interview revealed how incorrect that assumption was. As much potential as Kevin Porter Jr. may have displayed, Silas surely recognized there was no precedent for him running the point. Quite the opposite, he had a reputation as a renowned black hole. Why would a front office with a plan to lose games want a guy like this to run the offense instead of a veteran or one of their young draft picks? It honestly seems so obvious that it’s hard to believe someone couldn’t see the likely truth - that **KPJ was a hand-selected tank commander**. However, thanks to their irrational confidence in him, a huge portion of Rockets fans embraced the idea that KPJ was the face of the franchise alongside Jalen. Of course, there is zero chance that the Rockets front office is going to publicly correct this line of thought. They will never come out and say, “We don’t think Kevin is our starting point guard of the future, but we’re going to give him the ball.” There is no benefit in saying it, and a boatload of potential harm from admitting it. So when a large number of fans embraced KPJ, it provided the perfect cover to continue putting the keys to the offense in the hands of one of the least-qualified players to run it. Additionally, it allowed Stone the chance to try to polish an uncut diamond in the rough with the hopes of turning a top-55 protected second-round pick into an actual, rotation-caliber player if things went well (*sidenote: KPJ’s transformation was actually pretty remarkable, in my opinion. As someone who never expected much out of him, I do think he grew into a decent rotation player, as I suspect we will see this season in LA*). 

**As soon as Phase 2 began, it became clear that the Plan had almost certainly never been to give KPJ the keys to the franchise when it was winning time, as he was replaced with a veteran point guard immediately following the start of free agency**. We now know that the years-long rumor of Stone pursuing a reunion with James Harden was true. Udoka may have chosen Fred VanVleet over Harden, but the underlying play was the same – spend big money in free agency to upgrade the point guard position. Remember how much of an effect one player can have on the game? Well, that effect is amplified if that player has the most important role in the offense… running the point.

From a front office standpoint, I have to believe that **not only did Stone recognize the importance of the point guard on the offense, but that he had chosen to short this position in order to weaken the overall product**. Point guard is arguably the deepest position in the NBA, and there are always decent players available (*insert .gif of Tyus Jones clapping enthusiastically*). It would have been exceedingly easy to get a competent veteran point guard to sit on the bench in lieu of Boban (*Side note: Maintaining good vibes throughout Phase 1 was obviously a big concern for Stone, and despite fans’ attempts to tear the locker room apart with their body language policing, it’s been very apparent in hindsight that the team chemistry was top-notch, something Stone strongly defends. While he may not have provided much practical advice, Boban certainly helped keep spirits high despite the losing. Silas was another aspect of these good vibes. His easy-going demeanor was a far better choice than getting an ‘accountability’ coach to scream at guys about playing losing basketball when the entire plan was literally to play losing basketball.*); even something as simple as bringing back Schroder or Augustin provided a huge upgrade to the team’s odds of winning games.  

But a tank cannot be allowed to be derailed by a veteran with an axe to grind. Not when Daishen Nix exists. Stone raised eyebrows when he said he thought of Nix as a ‘lottery-level talent’. While some fans eagerly heightened their expectations for the team with the hope that Nix was going to be a quality addition, **I feel it is fair to question if Stone really believed that the primary backup point guard had game-changing talent** (at least, of the positive variety). If he did believe that, it certainly doesn’t explain why Nix was unceremoniously dismissed as soon as Phase 1 ended. If he wasn’t in the future plans, Nix could have been waived at any point in time during the 2023 season. Unless, of course, **Stone** ***wanted*** **Nix to be playing the backup point guard minutes**. It’s very interesting to me that the ‘mandatory Nix minutes’ ceased immediately following Silas’s emotional breakdown that led to his only ejection during his tenure. At that same moment he stopped running 3-centers (opening up more playing time for his best player) as his lineups reverted from the experimental 11 or 12-man platoons back to the standard 9 or 10-man rotations that basically every coach has run for time immemorial, including Silas himself when he first came to Houston. With Silas blaming fan pressure as one of the factors in his nervous breakdown, I can’t help but wonder if Stone finally took the handcuffs off as he took pity on the mental state these “experimental” lineups had left his good friend in.

It is well-documented that Stone and Silas spoke on a daily basis, with Stone giving advice to both his coach and players. Is it really easier to believe that Silas stubbornly ignored all of Stone’s advice and was “experimenting” with 11-man rotations because he was trying hard to win and had apparently had the revelation that playing more rookies and G-Leaguers was the best path to wins, ***or*** that Silas was trying to make his boss and friend happy by running lineups that helped to achieve the institutional goal of winning closer to 20 games than 30? It doesn’t even require a direct order from Stone to make this a likely option. Simply commenting about how much it would help to expand the rotation and play more than the top 7 or 8 guys (*wink-wink, nudge-nudge, know what I mean?*) would be more than enough to explain why Silas would do something that is clearly anathema to putting the most competitive rotation possible on the court. Anyone who has ever been in a successful relationship recognizes the importance of keeping one’s partner happy, and Stone and Silas were clearly partners in choosing how the team would look and play. To me it was obvious that the team had embarked upon a path of preemptive tanking in order to avoid starting the season hot and then being unable to land in the bottom 3 teams, or in other words, what happened to the Jazz. What should have tipped fans off was when Alperen Sengun got benched for Bruno Fernando right after he dismantled the Spurs in the first preseason game. 

Earlier in the summer, Silas had declared Sengun the starting center, speaking of how much he loved the playmaking AlP brought to the position. There was no reason for Silas to reverse course on his statement and bench Sengun after his success against the Spurs if his primary goal was winning. The Rockets have one of the best advanced stats departments in the association, one which would have surely alerted Stone and Silas of AlP’s positive impact if their eyes had somehow fallen out of their heads and they completely missed it, the way fans often pretend. The front office seemed to be well aware of how important he was at the end of the 2022 season, when they held him out of two must-lose games against Sacramento. **But Rockets fans did not recognize that benching the Alperen Sengun for Bruno Fernando was likely a tanking move, because they did not recognize Sengun was by far the most positively impactful player on the team, and thus the player most in need of having his minutes and role limited**. Almost nobody in the Rockets fanbase believed Sengun was a cornerstone player prior to the 2023 draft. I know this because I begged them to consider him as such, yet got almost nobody to cosign the idea. Fans felt that Silas hated AlP because he held Sengun accountable for his lack of defense and seemed annoyed when questioned about it. My theory is that AlP needed to improve his defense anyway, so it was a good year to develop those skills (which he did, to the point that everyone on the team raved about his improvement in March 2023), and that Silas’s visible annoyance was not due to AlP, with whom he had a good relationship, but from repeatedly getting questions about something that was so obviously a tanking move, but that he was unable to openly confirm. 

A vocal portion of fans felt Silas hated Sengun and didn’t want to run the offense through him. AlP quashed those narratives in an interview for Turkish TV in which he said he had a great relationship with Silas, who he felt was misunderstood by fans, and that Silas had trained him to run the point. This should have been obvious to fans in 2021, had they not been solely focused on why Silas wasn’t staggering KPJ and Jalen. The answer was obvious. The young guards froze Sengun out of the offense when they shared the floor. Not staggering them was the only way to get AlP reps running the bench units. Many fans seem to think Silas hated Sengun and refused to play through him because of a slavish devotion to a specific guard-centric style of play. These fans clearly had blocked the Christian Wood experience from their minds. When Wood was available, offense frequently ran through him. 

Silas’s ‘random offense’ asked the players to read the defense and react to it. Dubbed “Everybody eats” by the team, it was a version of the Warriors offense, ideal for the modern NBA. The problem being that such an offense requires a lot of experience, BBIQ and chemistry for teams to run it effectively, and the young Rockets had none of that. Developing the young talent was Silas’s primary goal, so what better way than getting a head start on learning an optimal offense for a group composed of multiple guys who could be top options? Running specific plays to feature one guy doesn’t help develop everyone on the team and actually doesn’t even really develop that player. It just makes him look good. Learning how to spam one skill is not as useful as learning when to do what for oneself without being instructed. Many of the largest accounts on Rockets Twitter refused to understand this. They complained incessantly that guys were not being put in optimal positions by running ideal plays, not recognizing that the chaos they were watching was actually not only better for development, but also aiding the team in delivering the losses they didn’t believe were the goal of Phase 1. 

**Asking guys to just play their games and giving them the freedom to make decisions in the moment will frequently result in mistakes, but the internalized, organic learning that comes from that is an optimal way to increase the players’ overall feel for the game.** Richard Jefferson defended Silas’s methods as being a great way to increase a player’s BBIQ, something that Jabari Smith Jr. and KJ Martin both pointed to as personal areas of growth under Silas. Jabari was also grateful for the support and confidence Silas gave him when he was suffering through a horrific shooting slump. That freedom to make mistakes without getting benched allowed Jabari the necessary reps to get right. Over the last quarter of the 2023 season he actually had better stats than he did in year one under Udoka, which is when most people believe he made a ‘leap’; but the truth is that the improvement had been incremental and on full display throughout his rookie season. 

\[*Ed. note: This piece is evolving into a defense of Silas and his methods. While the rebuild and its coach are inextricably linked, that is not the purpose here and would require several thousand more words, a timeline of relevant details, and a significant amount of statistical supporting evidence to show exactly how well the young core developed under Silas. As this is getting quite long already, such a defense is better saved for a later installment. But there is good reason to point out one more major point in the defense of the developmental methods that Silas used, and it’s not that these methods were good enough for LeBron James, Steph Curry, and Luka Doncic, but instead reflects upon how one of the greatest coaching figures in the game viewed SIlas’s methods.*\]

When **Gregg Popovich** was questioned about Houston’s process, he praised it, and **admired Silas’s patience and refusal to skip steps**. “Patience” is an interesting word for Pop to use. He seems to have found it commendable that Silas *wasn’t* tearing into the young players when they screwed up. This makes sense to anyone who has worked with a learning-via-mistakes system. When embracing mistakes as learning opportunities, a strict structure of accountability is not practical. Why would someone punish a learner for making the mistakes that are literally the basis of their education? Most of the time, a guy already recognizes when he has screwed up, and being disciplined in front of millions of viewers may not be the most effective strategy for getting all teenagers to do better. A primary concern for learners is demotivation, and getting consistently yelled at while losing may provide a quick path to accomplishing those unfortunate ends. Especially when it is obvious to everyone that the team has not been built to prioritize winning, it seems odd to focus on delivering accountability for not playing ‘winning basketball’. For an infamous disciplinarian like Popovich, it seems strange to think he might not look for every opportunity to yell at a player!    

But the greatest praise would come the following year when Pop’s 2024 season had many media members and fans questioning if he had gone soft and lost a step in his old age. 

There is a saying that “imitation is the sincerest form of flattery…”

Remember at the start of this tome when I stated I believed Stone’s Plan had already been copied by another team? Enter the San Antonio Spurs. I do not follow that team with the same level of intensity with which I watch Rockets games and media coverage, but I absolutely noticed the parallels as **the Spurs appeared to run Stone’s Plan in their rebuilding process**. The Spurs’ season began with wonky rotations that often ran much deeper than expected and featured developmental players and guys playing out of position. Wembanyama’s minutes were limited and his best skill (rim defense) was not properly utilized. The offense was run by Jeremy Sochan, a wing who had never played the point before, prompting Bill SImmons to say the whole situation felt a little “stealth-tanky”. Fans saw the chaos and lack of accountability and assumed Pop had lost a lot of his bark as well as his bite as the Spurs struggled mightily out of the gate, helping to stake an early claim as one of the worst teams in the league. But as the season progressed, all these ‘flaws’ were systematically repaired and the team ended the season on a much stronger note, more representative of their actual position in the league’s hierarchy. This late-season success provided a great amount of positive vibes heading into an offseason in which key veterans were added. The Spurs, with arguably the best coach of all time, the best prospect of all time, and a supporting cast significantly better than the Rockets had in 2023, managed to scratch out the same 22 wins that Houston had produced the year before, securing a high-quality Robin for their Batman. Do not be surprised if all the national media members who feel Pop is washed (looking at you, Nate Duncan) get a rude awakening this season as he returns to running more practical rotations and plays and showing a general interest in winning games that he had clearly softened his stance on last season. The Spurs are a lock to win 35 games in my opinion, and could potentially push this number into the 40s if they get the same quality of play from CP3 and Barnes that Houston got from FVV and Brooks (I don’t honestly expect this to happen, though, although they are better players, they are also significantly older and unlikely to hold up to a similar minutes load)

So let’s try to wrap this up for now with a **TL;DR:**

**I believe Rafael Stone designed a new method of 'preemptive tanking', designed around running bad lineups at the beginning of the season rather than the end to assure good draft odds while still allowing the team to finish the season on a strong note, bringing positive vibes into the offseason. By removing the veterans and competent point guard play, he knew that the only way the team he built would win was if the young stars turned in superstar level performances. The acceptance of mistakes was a part of the process, and not something to be punished, because those mistakes were both learning opportunities and important for the end goal of getting a high draft pick. The Spurs noticed this process and copied it because it is effective at developing young players while losing games.**

Closing commentary:

Phase 1 of the Rockets rebuild was deemed embarrassing by fans who didn’t recognize the team was actively tanking for draft odds and who complained about not seeing development in particular areas (most specifically team defense and accountability) while willfully ignoring obvious improvements in other areas. But the actual process of Phase 1 successfully resulted in attaining the team’s primary objectives… getting the best draft odds possible while preparing the squad to play ‘winning ball’ as soon as veterans were added for Phase 2.

TIlman Fertitta confirmed the Rockets planned to tank for 3 years. Rafael Stone benched John Wall for Jae’Sean Tate so Kevin Porter Jr could learn to run an NBA offense by making mistakes (It’s also worth acknowledging that Wall was dismissed from the team facilities right after delivering a healthy dose of accountability to the young guards). These are facts about Stone’s Plan that Rockets Twitter refused to recognize. Had they understood the assignment, they may have viewed the product differently.

Their current narrative would have you believe that Stone built a team with the intent to win 30ish games in the year the best prospect since LeBron was entering the draft. Stone saw that his good friend was making numerous questionable decisions for over 2 years, and instead of correcting those choices, chose to ride it out because if the team’s poor shooting continued, it might help them achieve better draft odds. Furthermore, instead of internally promoting G-League-Championship-winning coach, Mahmoud Abdelfattah, who was famous for his strong voice and accountability (literally the top 2 qualities ownership sought in the new coach hire), Stone kept Silas in the head coach role for the entire season because nobody wanted to fire him after his dad died… even though Silas had been running rotations for months prior to that which indicated he had forgotten everything he had ever learned about basketball… were he actually trying his hardest to win games (because of course he was; there was zero chance he was aware of any plan to tank for Wembanyama or willing to aid his boss in achieving it). 

I submit as an alternative theory that Rafael Stone identified that removing vocal veteran players from the team and the ‘accountability’ they inherently provide, and running expanded rotations featuring multiple developmental players and sub-par point guards in an environment where very young players were free to explore their games without being punished for playing ‘losing basketball’ would sufficiently handicap the team as to where they could stealthily tank their way to a bad record. And that he was well aware that one could easily add veterans, game management, quality point guard play and accountability once winning became a priority, resulting in the huge leap in wins in 2024 that he had announced as a franchise goal in the summer of 2022.",101,33,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1gkmo2s/how_rafael_stones_plan_for_phase_1_of_the_houston/,2024-11-05 20:09:23,"I don't intend to read all that though I'm sure it is good.

I just don't see how it was ever considered an embarrassment by anyone other than casual fans and the media for casual fans?

They got a good return on russ that was washed, good return on harden, good return on basically every player they've dealt. Really only the oladipo move was a negative one.

Despite Jalen Greens struggles they got Sengun in that class, Jabari hasn't been great but they got Tari Eason, last year they got 2 players who were considered top 5 talents as well.

Part of it is they have certainly had luck keeping their picks and jumping in the lottery but it has always been a well run rebuild. Certainly there were moments where Jalen was struggling and mobley looked like a generational player where it looked like they made the wrong pick at 2, but their decisions have all been B+ or better aside from him really.

I mean they got fucked by Lopez but it didn't really cost them any material assets either. They have loads of expendable salary and none of it bad should they want to make a trade || Ok so is your argument they basically figured a way to tank that seemed less obvious?  Cause I feel like it still was obvious. Just plausible deniability?

And at the end of the day, in my mind, they still don’t have a single all star.  Possibly Sengun, but isn’t he Sabonis at best?  A nice player but flawed & inevitably the best player on a play-in team?

I guess i don’t see the profundity here.  A little less obvious tank but they fucked it up because they still don’t have top end talent.  And let me add a caveat because i do not know much about this year’s draft class. || Suppose that instead of KPJ, Jalen was the featured focal point of the offense. How do you think this would have impacted his development, team success in years 2021-2024, and overall odds at getting good draft picks used to draft Jabari, Amen, and most recently Reed Shepard? || what a brilliant piece of writing and analysis, tysm for the education on a team I hadn't paid attention to in some time

enjoyed the deep dive in org goals, personnel management, relationships and learning through mistakes!

would gladly read what you publish thanks again || As a Thunder homer I think they have ‘The Model’ however hardly anyone can match Sam Presti’s genuis. || [removed] || [removed] || Because they looked awful, system-less, and direction-less under Stephen Silas' coaching.

Me neither. But Rockets Twitter is hypothetically full of non-casuals, and if you paid attention to it during the rebuild, you would have seen very few accounts acknowledging that Phase 1 was going well. Even the largest accounts (who one would presume have a healthy amount of knowledge about basketball) were expecting more ""winning basketball"" and furious over the product they were viewing.

>they have certainly had luck keeping their picks and jumping in the lottery

Minor point of order, that Houston's pick never actually jumped in the lottery (only the BKN pick did). A lot of fans bemoaned Houston's lottery luck. || That said I do agree with your take on surrounding young talent with vets.  As a Wolves fan I do think that its a big difference on why KAT never developed (and to a lesser extent Wiggins, tho i doubt anyone was fixing his motor) and why Ant is developing so fast. 

Ultimately tho they bet on the wrong young guys imo. || >Cause I feel like it still was obvious

You and me both. Trust me when I say the BlogBois in the Rockets fanbase did not see it and have built an entire narrative around 'alternative facts' (often proven incorrect over time) that the team was trying its hardest to win. The primary purpose of this document is to provide what I believe to be a more accurate accounting of the actual steps taken in the rebuild.

>they fucked it up because they still don’t have top end talent.

I think it's too soon to say this. Other than Amen Thompson and Tari Eason (both of whom look like they have All-Defense talent), all their picks were amongst the youngest in their draft classes. They came into the league scrawny, but are visibly improving as they add muscle to their frames. AlP is tracking to be better than Sabonis by the metrics. Even if he is the best prospect long-term (I don't believe he is), an All-Star surrounded by multiple All-Defense talent and shooters who aren't negatives on defense is a contender in today's league. The NBA has changed, making depth of top-end talent incredibly important. Teams like CLE & NYK are showing paths to winning without a superstar, while teams like DEN, MIL & LAL are proving that just having the best player on the floor isn't necessarily sufficient anymore.

But the more important point to make here is that they haven't tasked their young talent with the workload or responsibility of a superstar, yet, which I believe is the primary reason folks who don't follow the team closely don't recognize just how talented some of the guys are.

The over-reliance on KPJ (and now FVV) hasnt given their true talent the raw touches required to show how much they are capable of. || Reed Sheppard's status would obviously have been unaffected as he was a result of the Nets trade.

But I do believe that Jalen Green is a better player than KPJ, and that giving him the ball more often would have yielded better results. || Jalen was a close 2nd in USG% on the Rockets in his Rookie year, and outright 1st in USG% in his 2nd and 3rd seasons. He's pretty much been the focal point of the offense, for better or worse, since he came into the league. || Thank you for the kind words! || I forgot to link this when I wrote the post...

It's not in-depth analysis, I was just trying to reach the many, many Rockets fans on X who claimed Houston wasn't tanking by design... That they were just a bad team.

But if you know who the Beastie Boys are, you may get a kick out of it. || Sam Presti's model for this recent rebuild was to take advantage of new, desperate owners.

I'm not sure how sustainable that is. Taking advantage of a new owner's impatience can only happen in certain circumstances.

He did also get lucky to have his best player get injured at the right time (not to mention moving up in the lottery, something Houston's pick never did, fwiw), and while one can argue that is more replicable... Is it really? You can force a guy to sit out, but not all of them will willingly acquiesce without hard feelings that could impact the team's future relationship with that player. || We removed your comment for being low effort whining. || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || Yet in hindsight, we know that they were developing fine by being given that agency to make their own decisions. Only Jalen's lack of defensive intensity had serious legs as an issue of concern (and that's not exactly uncommonly in young players), but it didn't take long for him to start trying on that end once Fred & Dillon were on the court barking at him. || Yes casuals || I'm not a rockets fan but I know a bunch and most of then had been thinking it's going well even before this. If you know Paulo Alves from the Lager Line, we speak a decent amount on discord and he's always been positive about the direction of the rebuild, even when moves have seemed questionable at the time he's usually come up with a positive spin within a couple of days. || I've been a Wolves fan ever since they acquired Cassell, so I agree with this. 

Plus, they fumbled the Butler situation horribly.

Management & ownership have been issues until recently. || I still think you need All-Stars to win a title. And I don’t feel those guys are on that trajectory.  And granted these days that is a pretty damn high bar.

Idk those guys have pretty bad efficiency and typically when your workload increases, your efficiency decreases. But i mostly have been boxscore scouting and only really watching them when they play the Wolves so will admit Im missing there. || You clearly have a good basketball mind. Would be interesting to hear your thoughts on the OK rebuild too! || Jalen, Sengun, Tari and Tate are the only ones on the Rockets roster now who played under Silas. I wouldn't say their development was helped at all by their time under his coaching. || Funny that you mention Prod by name. He and Don Knock's 'Safe Spaces' on Twitter is where the vitriol began way back in October of 2021. Paulo would start each space off raging against Silas's coaching and begging for him to be fired as early as a dozen games into Jalen's career. When I went against his views and tried to explain the pedagogical value behind Silas's 'learn-by-mistakes' methods to calm the fanbase, Paulo and Don (and later Will) literally banned me from talking about that information, claiming the venue was inappropriate for such discussion. Then, when I held my own Space to try to explain what was happening, they spread lies about what I was saying and personally attacked me as ""delusional"", ""jealous"", ""a fascist"" (even called me a Nazi 😂), and ""a pussy"" amongst other things.

So, no. He and other large accounts were not only **not** ""positive about the direction of the rebuild"", they were literally leading their 'Fire Silas' agenda by throwing gasoline on the fans' flames and censoring views that could portray it in a positive light. || You're missing Jabari from that list. A guy who literally praised Silas for the things I brought up in the post.

And as already mentioned, everyone on the team agrees that AlP's defense improved greatly under him, and SengÜn credited Silas for training him to run point (even if it rarely happens in the current offensive schemes). || Well yes silas also definitely needed to be fired though

He was terrible, I know that FVV and Brooks helped make the rockets more competent, but the rockets offensive process was pretty horrific under silas and the defensive effort was terrible. Two things that are largely determined by coaching.

If ProdiG called you a nazi then you probably said some shit, he doesn't say stuff like that for no reason. || His podcast partner, Don Knock, was actually the one who called me a Nazi. He claimed I was trying to tell fans how to react because I said ""You have to have patience with young players"". Paulo was pushing the narrative that I'm just a jealous crazy guy who fans should ignore.

Hard disagree on the idea Silas needed to be fired for reasons that I went into in the original post (as well as a number of others which would form the basis of the continuation to this post that I didn't have time or room for here... and which also seemed irrelevant to the basic premise that most of that was happening was intentional with the belief that these were switches that could be easily flipped heading into Phase 2)",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.086,0.735,0.179,1.0,0.09,0.723,0.187,0.9997

The team has not played together for a long period of time. A lot of new faces that have yet to learn each other's tendencies on the court.

#2. Bench Production:

Other than Deuce McBride (averaging 10 points off the bench) the Knicks have little to no point production from their second unit.

#3. Lack of Size:

Knicks are not only small on the interior (besides Towns) but they're also small at the guard position. Teams are beginning to play Brunson with bigger players to make him work harder for his points.

#4. Defensive Positioning:

Some of their defensive woes are also due to lack of continuity... But there has also been just a lack of accountability. Their inability to guard the pick and roll is abysmal. This was exploited mightily against the Celtics.

#5. Offensive Execution:

This *8 eyes starring at Brunson* offense is tough to watch. Little to no ball movement that leads to ill advised shots and turnovers.

Any Suggestions?",144,78,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1glhyhx/top_5_reasons_why_the_ny_knicks_are_struggling/,2024-11-06 23:08:06,"Agreed on all points. 

No player is consistently playing to their strengths right now. OG seems to be the only one who isn't overthinking and playing basketball.

Everything feels so forced on the offensive side of things. They *want* to make the right play and extra pass. It just isn't fluid yet.

Same with the defensive side of things. They maybe too often over help but at least they are playing for each other. 

Not sure what can be done with the benches performance. Not sure Hart off the bench would help. Deuce is hot and cold. Kolek seems to be a player but needs more minutes. Having no reliable gritty big hurts.  Sims is too...passive? They tried to get him some alley oops today but even that failed.

There are still glimmers of greatness where everyone touches the ball and they end up with a wide open look.
Or a team gets locked down and they look like a Thibs defense.

 I still have hope that they'll figure it out. This team is different than last years and I am willing to be patient after many many suffering years. Hope is a killer though 🤣 || I can’t believe the main argument in this sub is the offense. I agree the offense could be better but even w all of its flaws it’s top 4 in the league statistically. 

Defense is the issue, rebounding is the issue, turnovers r an issue(which is related to offense). Can’t be outscored by 20 in the paint, outrebounded by 10 on the offensive glass, and turnover the ball at twice the rate of the opposing team and expect to win || I’m not worried. As we gel, we will get more players back from injury. First Cam and Precious. That will give Brunson some rest, allow Hart to boost the bench, and give us some size in the starting lineup. We should be clicking by the time Mitch is back || I’m going to say that regardless of their current struggles, they will finish in the top 3 in the East. They had a rough last 2 games as the better team, but 2 of their losses were the Celtics and Cavs, both of whom look great so far. Even the Rockets aren’t a bad team as I expect them to contend in the West for a play-in or playoff spot. 

Typically teams with multiple important new players take some time to gel. I’ve seen even super teams like the Heat back in the day have really rough starts to the year in their first season. Even in the case of Bridges, who clearly knows Brunson and Hart, the schemes they run in the NBA is different than Villanova. 

With that said, I don’t see them beating the Celtics even though I do see them being a top 3 team in the East. || OP’s Suggestion: The Knicks are very limited to what they can do with this roster; loss a lot of depth due to their trades over the last year.

A line up change may need to happen - perhaps starting Deuce and bringing Hart off the bench. || #1 they fucked up the team!

Everything fit well last season (chemistry) when everybody was healthy. The Knicks didn’t need KAT when Randle was playing his role as front court scorer well and Knicks could’ve just signed a free agent for depth at C. || Brunson is a great story and has made himself into an All NBA caliber player. But no team is winning a title with him as its focal point. I know Knicks fans will go apeshit. But he has to work so hard and his game is so physical, so he will break down. He tries on defense, but good teams will target him in the playoffs. That the Mavericks had Luka, Brunson and Porzingis on their roster but couldn't make it work is sad. Porzingis is a perfect match with Brunson. || This team has had insane roster turnover over the last year. If you look at the nine-man rotation from the start of last season, only three guys are left (Brunson, Hart, Robinson). It's going to take time to develop chemistry with this group. It's been particularly obvious on defense, lots of blown rotations and guys not knowing their assignments. That stuff will clean up, especially with a detail-oriented maniac of a head coach. Personally, I'm much more encouraged by the moments where things click than discouraged by the moments where they don't. I'm holding off any negative judgments until around Christmas, after this team has had two months to gel. || The Knicks have a good roster they just added new pieces and haven't played together much yet. They'll be fine relax || They have 2 offensive only players and 3 defense first players. They lack an identity. You can play one defense liability, not two. And its much harder to do it with a bad center. So much of what you said was right. However switching it up with Deuce won't change much. Unless Bridges becomes the player he was for 2 and a half months (when he was first traded to Brooklyn) and not the player he has been the rest of his career, where he is at best an average offensive player, they have no second ball handling option to play with Brunson on the court. They had a good few months where everything clicked, and then the organization pushed everything in based on that. Just wait until OG gets hurt. || Will personally start to come to conclusions about this team once robinson comes back || Thibs can’t coach a 3 ball heavy offence. Idk how much longer his tenure  here will be || Their roster doesn’t scream contender to me, never did. They were overhyped because it is the best team the Knicks have had going into a season in ages, but I don’t see Brunson as a one on a title team, I don’t see KAT as the 2 on a title team, etc. || A lot of their bench is hurt rn so I don't think that's a big problem in the long run. ( cam payne, precious, Mitchell) the fact that they are a top 4 offense and they still have all these problems is a good sign, when they start to gel and gain chemistry their offense will be  devastating.

 Their defense is an issue, but Mitchell Robison will change the dynamics of team heavily. He's  one of the best rim protectors in the nba. Last year, before the og trade, the Knicks went from a top 10 defense to the 29th ranked defense when he got hurt.  They could Run Mitchell/kat/og/bridges/brunson or just play Robison at the 5 and go full defense.  

I would wait till January to make any hard judgements since brunson doesn't really heat up till the 2nd half of the year. || Ah... are they struggling tho? I get they're not starting hot out of the gate but while some teams just click right away most often it takes a couple of months to adjust and find their groove together. This is kind of to be expected. It's only a couple of weeks into the season. If they're like this after the all-star break sure they're struggling. But for the most part now they're just adjusting. || I feel like we've seen this sort of thing a million times, an underdog team with great depth has a great year with underrated players who play super hard and have great chemistry but ultimately lose out because they lack scoring and/or has bad luck with injuries...... they then swap depth for a star player to bring in more offence and just forget all the reasons why they had success before and just hope it gets better.

I would say it is still early and they can still add role players and when it comes to the playoffs it's easier to get players just simply trying harder than it is when you have 60/70 games left || Start with Thibs. If Thibs doesn’t give bench chance, how would u expect bench production? || Yeah every new team is going to need time to figure it out. You've got great points. 

Even after theyve gotten more comfortable with each other I dont know if theres enough playmaking and individual creation. Funny enough julius Randle provides both of those.  And size and rebounding.  

And as great of hoopers as OG and bridges are they are so so similar in playstyles.  Do teams really need two of them? Or should one be sacrificed for size or playmaking? Or should they just let this roster marinate? || [removed] || [removed] || I brought this a bunch of times. Feel like when precious comes back he should play the 4 and down size everyone to their natural positions. || It's about teamwork and overcoming your differences. Hopefully during the season they will correct so much if not all of their struggles and turn them into positives. || As a nets fan who watched him play for two seasons, the biggest reason is that Mikal Bridges just isn’t that good. 

The Knick’s traded a superstar haul for an elite role player. He’s supposed to be their second or third best player but he cannot create his own offense and is a solid defender but not a great one. He’s a bad rebounder and passer as well. If the bucks end up imploding and the nets keep the top four protected pick, that trade becomes a disaster.

They also abandoned their defensive identity with the KAT trade. In a vacuum he’s better than Harteinstein but having Brunson and KAT on the floor during crunch time gives them a Swiss cheese defense. || The issue is rim protection. KAT hasnt been terrible but they seem to panic and switch him to be the roamer with OG guarding bigs. When that happens KAT hasn’t recovered well and can’t seem to fit the role. It also creates perimeter D issues when they chose that approach. || The reason the Knicks struggle every season is because they play Carmelo Anthony style every season, and a team whose entire game revolves around one player, regardless of the talent of the others, is never going to progress. It doesn't work in LA, it didn't work on the Rockets, and it's going to continue to not work. || 1. The Mikal Bridges trade was a big gamble and i dont' think they will get the player they think they were getting. High usg is not his forte and if he's the Suns version.. and it looks like he's settling into that guy... it's fine but they already had that kind of guy and that's OG. 

2. The first problem relates to the overall problem as the offense is too Brunson centric, yes the offense looks and performs fine now but in the playoffs having one ball dominant guard is a recipe for a first rd exit. You need options and KAT is phenomenal and great but most of his offense is generated by other people (62% assisted 2p fgs). They need Bridges or OG to step up. 

3. The defense sucks. Minny figured out a defense anchored by KAT was not going to work and the knicks are figuring that out now. Mitch will come back but integrating KAT and Mitch together will take time something Minny also learned so it could be rough going.

Their defense will get better especially with Mitch but it wont get better enough and their offense will regress as well. I have them as a middling playoff team and i'm a knicks fan. || I feel like Brunson is the main key here, because defenses have figured him out now (put a fast and taller defender on him, everyone collapse into the paint soon as he starts to drive). Rotations are off because of bad positioning so kick outs are failing but that's also because of Brnson not adjusting adequately; he gets stuck in the paint like a deer in headlights. And there's almost never a body in the dunkers spots, partly due to lack of size.

NGL I know the entire league is in love with Thibs but I think he's one of those ""good enough"" coaches who people respect too much to admit he's not championship caliber. He'll get you close to the Finals, maybe into the Finals, but I don't see his style of ball leading to a chip. KAT is playing great but the team has to find consistent success outside of him. || Or the fact the coach has always only used so many players Tom has just like this Chicago to with rose deng and Noah. Dudes play to many mins and get gassed and you get lackluster bench production because guys don’t get enough mins to get into a rhythm || Was this made on ChatGPT? It looks, feels, and sounds artificial.

The way he has been playing to start the year makes me believe that he could be the legit #1 scoring option on a championship team (not to say that the Kings are a championship caliber team, because they're obviously not).

Needless to say, I have been really impressed with how efficiently he has scored the ball to start the year, and I just don't think there is nearly enough conversation around him. 

Fox provides so much value to Sacramento, yet often times Sabonis is the one that gets a lot of the credit or conversation. Even though Sabonis is in a sense the engine of Sacramento's offense, I believe Fox is clearly their best player. He is one of the best scoring guards in the league and a capable player on the defensive end especially considering the lack of defensive talent around him.

I would like to get the sub's temperature on Fox, maybe I am too high on him, but I think he is a top 20-25 player in the league and in the Kyrie, Ja, Haliburton tier of guards.

I think his case is helped significantly by Morant still finding his feet and what unfortunately seems to have been a legit post-injury regression of Halliburton, but at the very least, right now, he's playing the best of the guards you mentioned.

He plays in SAC though mate, so he'll be lucky to be an all star for yet another year. || Give him his flowers? 

You wrote a long post arguing he is arguably a top 25 player. He was named all NBA third team all nba. He's ranked 22 in the ringer 100, 26 on ESPN. In both of those he is ranked ahead of Sabonis.

He's an excellent player. He isn't going to get to the Mitchell/booker/Brunson level until he makes some noise in the playoffs.

Why do people think that every player is underrated or disrespected? || Tbf Fox’s play before these past two games has been hit or miss. The biggest difference has been his renewed willingness to attack the paint. He’s focusing on high percentage shots and hitting middys/threes when they’re available. He started the year by shooting a ton of threes (and missing many of them). Fortunately, he’s pivoted when the Kings need him the most. He’s re-discovered what made him so successful in 2022-23. Let’s hope it continues. The Kings could be a legit threat if he keeps this up when DeRozan, Sabonis, and Monk return. || Prior to them trading Haliburton when his value was likely the lowest, I was really hoping the Pistons would've traded for him. I love Fox. Ivey is now what I thought Fox would be in terms of a complement to Cade, but obviously Fox is significantly better lol  

He should've probably been an all-star last year, hope he is again this year.  Glad to see him getting more attention || Fox was 5th in the league last year in clutch scoring providing 122 clutch points, just above Jalen Brunson on similar efficiency. The big difference is that Brunson was +59 while Fox was -2 in the clutch. A good thing for Sacto is that DeRozan was 2nd in the league and had a massive +94 plus/minus so that should give the Kings a couple more wins.   Other interesting players in the clutch were Ant at similar 43% fgs but with -44, Trae Young at 41% and -55. Malik Monk is also high on the list at 51% and +24!

So far this season Fox is leading the league in clutch scoring (45 so far) at 53% and +21. DeRozan is 4th btw :)

Your post is a little conflicting. You think he can be a #1 option on a championship team and also have him in the top 20-25 range, that doesn't make sense.

He was already in the Kyrie / Hali tier.

Also not a big fan of people 'giving flowers' and making judgements right after a good stretch of games as recency bias has a huge impact. || Fox's advanced numbers so far this year are a bit better than last year, but worse (especially the AST% and TOV%) than 2022-23 (which was his best season overall, and the Kings were 1st in OffRtg that year). He's shooting more from the outside this year, but the tradeoff is that he's getting to the line less too.  
    
He's obviously not going to be exactly the same every year, and there's plenty of time for things to rise, but he's not really doing anything at the moment that he hasn't done before. || Fox is a top 25 player and just had an incredible stretch, but he needs to be more consistent if we're going to lock him into the top 20. The NBA has never been more stacked with stars and while Fox's shooting has continually improved, his efficiency at the rim has been very underwhelming the last few seasons, holding back his best attribute as a player (superhuman speed with the ball in his hands). || Thanks for giving Fox some shine. He’s been great for us for years now. He was the Clutch Player of the Year two seasons ago and he’s one of the top closers in the league.

He’s definitely paying the small market/Sacramento tax. If he played for another team he would definitely be in those elite player discussions, kind of like Haliburton as soon as he went to the Pacers.

One aspect of his game that doesn’t get enough recognition is his defense. When the game is in crunch time, he’s one of the league’s best two-way players. His lateral movement and twitchiness are unmatched and he’s also the league steals leader at 2.0 steals per game (statmuse). He’s not a liability on defense and doesn’t get targeted on that end, unlike some of the more popular pgs across the league.

So yes - put some respect on De’Aaron Fox’s name. || Yah, it's been a while now, really since they traded Hali. 

And for all the talk about Haliburton, I think Fox has been the better and more valuable player.

Crazy thing is, he's been shooting the ball really well this year, but his 3-ball has been really streaky. If he shoots it like he did the last few years he's a 30 ppg scorer. || [removed] || Which is really unfortunate, because he deserved to be an all-star if not all-nba last year. But I expect a similar fate for him this year too. || Yah just seeing how well Ivey and Cade fit, I could only imagine what Fox would look like next to Cade. Those two would be really lethal next to one another. That is the thing about Fox that is so appealing to me. I feel like he can fit seamlessly next to so many star players in the league, whether it be a big, a wing, or even another guard.

It is a shame that he is stuck next to Sabonis and DeRozan for the foreseeable future. Not that either of them are bad players, they're both terrific. There is just a hard ceiling with those 2 next to Fox that wouldn't exist if he were next to a number of other players that fit his style better. || > And for all the talk about Haliburton, I think Fox has been the better and more valuable player.
> 
> 

This is some crazy recency bias.

Haliburton was All-NBA last year and led the league in assists. Fox is a volume scorer on below average efficiency who doesn't set up teammates remotely as well as Haliburton and doesn't space the floor or play off the ball nearly as well, either (98 TS+ last year for Fox, exactly on his career number, and 104 for Haliburton, also exactly on his career number). And the scoring gap between them last season was just 6 points -- despite Haliburton doubling Fox up in assists and doing everything far more efficiently. Fox actually averaged more turnovers than Haliburton despite 5 fewer assists per game.

Fox deserves credit for his start to this season, especially the last couple of games with DeMar and Sabonis hurt. I don't know why that credit has to come in the form of a shot at another player on another team. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || It’s hard to be an All-Star in a conference with Luka (fans will vote him in even if he plays the same way as he does right now), SGA and rejuvenated Steph. Then we add a new shining toy in Ant, Booker who is having a pretty good season so far and even Kyrie who has arguably been Mavs best player so far this seasons: that’s already 6 quality guards without even taking into account Ja; competition among West guards is brutal. || Agreed with the context comment. He's in a great context, but it does feel like there's a hard ceiling on this team. Maybe if Fox makes a leap, though, that ceiling gets pushed upwards a bit? Not sure, but it's definitely feasibly. I think they'd need to snag a few gritty defensive role players to really round out a championship roster but I don't think it's *too* far away if he makes a leap. Lots of ifs though || >Haliburton was All-NBA last year and led the league in assists. Fox is a volume scorer on below average efficiency who doesn't set up teammates remotely as well as Haliburton and doesn't space the floor or play off the ball nearly as well, either (98 TS+ last year for Fox, exactly on his career number, and 104 for Haliburton, also exactly on his career number). And the scoring gap between them last season was just 6 points -- despite Haliburton doubling Fox up in assists and doing everything far more efficiently. Fox actually averaged more turnovers than Haliburton despite 5 fewer assists per game.

  
I never understood why they rushed that trade.  Everyone was saying they didn't fit together, but Mike Brown probably could have made it work with a season or two.  They're fundamentally two different players, with two very different playing styles, and Haliburton can guard most SGs.  We're not talking CJ McCollum and Dame here we're they have the same weaknesses, and do the same things.  

Also, with Haliburton's penchant for getting injured, it's not like Fox won't get plenty of shots to run the offense without Haliburton.  They could have had a Manu/Tony thing going.  

Sabonis is great, but he's undersized in the West as a Center.  The Timberwolves did Denver and Sacramento a huge favor by getting rid of one of its three 7 footers.  But Sabonis has more value in the East. || You might be the one with recency bias. Two years ago, Fox made All NBA, was at 103 TS+, and won CPOY. Last year he led the league in steals in addition to his offensive contributions. He often guards the other team’s best guard or wing. He’s become a much more impactful player than Tyrese on the defensive end. 

It’s not really fair to compare assists, since Fox does not initiate the offense on most every possession like Hali does. The turnover thing is a fair point. Fox’s tend to happen when he needs to create a shot, though, so that also is impacted by the difference in their roles. || > It’s not really fair to compare assists, since Fox does not initiate the offense on most every possession like Hali does

That's because he's not nearly as good at it as Haliburton is. How is that ""not really fair"" to compare the entire concept of setting up your teammates and running an offense? That's completely absurd. || Tell me you don’t watch the Kings without telling me you don’t watch the Kings lol. 

I explained why in the part you quoted. It’s very simple. Sabonis initiates the offense on most possessions, so Fox doesn’t have nearly as many opportunities to get assists as Hali. Fox doesn’t even touch the ball on many possessions where DeRozan, Murray, or Huerter score.",0.0,0.556,0.444,0.34,0.015,0.814,0.171,0.9778,0.069,0.756,0.175,0.9998

They invested a significant amount of sengun for a good reason. He’s the face of the franchise and future all star all nba player. But they paid jalen green too early in my opinion. The deal was sort of team friendly, but he’s shooting sub 40% on the season which is suboptimal. 

  
Houston has to pay amen, tari, Jabari, reed, cam, etc. They have a plethora of young talent which makes me think they are going to have to move on from 2 to 3 of them and package them for a clear top 10 player (sengun could be top 10 based on flashes, but they might want to create a big 2)

2. Magic

  
They paid franz the max which is the right move because he’s an all star this year and might go for all nba and he’s ur 1a or 1b depending on the night. They r obviously going to pay p5 the max.

  
The question is if Franz gets all nba because he is on pace for at least 3rd team, how does their cap space situation look like? And we all know paolo will get all nba next year. 

  
They also have a plethora of young talent. Antonio black, jalen Suggs (looks like he’s 34), jonathan Isaac (26, but he’s very very important), mo wagner (26 and brothers with Franz), jett howard, etc.

PG is old injury prone and a shell of his former self. The former mvp of the league is  also injury prone with terrible intangibles.  Nick nurse has rumoured to be losing the locker room. This is the textbook definition of a shit show 😂 || Although I appreciate having a discussion about young teams with tons of talent, I don't believe such teams qualify as ""having to make tough decisions.""

I think the kinds of teams that better fit the discussion are the ones who are very good (e.g. maybe contenders, maybe recent champs, maybe top heavy with veteran stars), **but can't afford to pay for two ideas at once.**

That is, they can only 

1. rebuild
2. stay pat and remain ""not quite good enough""
3. give up a key person or two and try to win it all now

The **Warriors** already made their tough decision by losing Klay and going for (3). It paid off for them.

The Bucks, Lakers, 6ers, and Heat all have ""tough decisions"" looming. || Feel like the Sixers are the very obvious answer to this.

They went from being one of the potential contenders going into the season, to one of the worst teams in the league. McCain and Maxey are solid for the future.. but this is a team that has/had championship aspirations and it’s pretty clear at this point it’ll take a miracle for that to happen.

I think the biggest question is what do you do with Embiid/PG? Do you punt this season.. pray they can stay healthy and run it back next season? They can barely play back to back now so we know how ridiculous that sounds. Do you start looking to move Embiid when you can, or PG? Will be hard with their ages, injuries, and contracts.

I think at this point if this is the Embiid we’re going to get moving forward you gotta seriously consider looking towards the future and very soon at that. || “Consolidating” multiple good young players into a star gets said a lot but seems very rare in reality. 

Who wants to give up a top 10 player for Houston’s 3, 4, & 5 best players when they start getting paid market rate?

That’s just a way to give up a ton to become the raptors.  || Okc. Max or super max to shai, Williams and chet.  I’m sure they can keep all three, but after that it becomes difficult to field a deep team. || On the other side of things I think Milwaukee has some hard decisions to make. The only guys doing any good on the team are Giannis portis and Dame and dames getting old. They need to choose between loyalty to their roster or really trying to win because Middleton and Lopez got them to where they are now but are to injury prone and old. Realistically they should get rid of them because we can see in golden state what happens when you go all in on player loyalty and drive away the young talent. || Pacers. They’re going to have to max Mathurin and that will send them into the 2nd apron without Turner. The question is if they’re good going into the second apron with this group. If no, they have a year and a half to make a trade || Don't see either of them in some type of predicament as you describe it. 

Houston is still miles away. No one will just give them a franchise piece for a package of green, amen, reed. They still need their franchise player to build around, senguin is probably at best a 1b.

Orlando is in a much better place. Wagner and paolo are those 1a and 1b guys. No way you would sacrifice either to keep the group of those other guys. Fit the pieces around the edges but none those guys would necessitate trading either of their franchise guys. || The Celtics were here years ago. In 2019, the team had Tatum and Brown, Smart, Rozier, Rob Williams, Yabusele. 

The reality is only the top couple guys are likely to be there more than 2-3 years. The other guys are spare parts who will likely either be used as trade bait to round out the roster (like Boston did getting Horford, Porzingis, DWhite and Jrue) or may wind up on team friendly 2nd contracts if they can figure it out. || Detroit.

Ivey has shown growth, but on paper, he still isn't a clean fit with Cade.  Duren is not playing well and has started the season looking like Ayton, no effort whatsoever.  Both are playing for their extensions. Only one appears to want to be in Detroit.  The following season, it's Ausar.  The next, it's Holland.  There are a lot of promising prospects, but on an individual basis. 

With the season going better than most expected, and the fanbase rabid to at least be competitive, tanking for a another young player in a strong draft, and moving forward to the latter part of the rebuild is one choice.  The other is to develop who they have and attempt to get them some playoff reps and make a trade to build around Cade.   

The vets have played well.  Do they offer them another contract?  Or, do they move them at the deadline like they most likely planned originally.  Beasley looks like he has turned the culture around, along with Bickerstaff.  There are quite a few tough decisions this season for Detroit,  too. || My Kings are up for this soon I think. Having Domas as a max, Fox likely to get the max, and an aging derozan on a team that’s regressed in three-point shooting after being built as a DHO-heavy offense with pretty bad defense means that the ceiling is not very high in a western conference that seems hell-bent on being so competitive that the 7th to like 12th seed fighting for play-ins. 

I appreciate that my team is playing fun basketball now and aren’t shit anymore but I cannot imagine that we can keep a double-max kind of payroll going for more than another couple of seasons unless Devin Carter develops into a star and provides the reliable third option that the Kings sorely need - and he’s started his rookie season injured. || Nola is coming up on some tough ones. Zion isn’t happy over there and it’s about time we stopped pretending it’s only injuries that have kept him uninterested. Hes been wasted since day 1 and should be holding down a top roster by now. Could’ve been a face or the face of the league but now he’s more like a fat kid punchline stuck in the swamp down there lol. Nola needs to stop messing around w the lotto and go for some kind of identity. || [removed] || Houston is in a really interesting situation because they have talent in a lot of areas, and not enough minutes to go around. For example, I think it’s time to start feeding starter minutes to Eason and Thompson, but that can’t happen right now. If I were Houston’s management I’d be looking to package Jabari and Green, at a minimum, and try to either get a steady vet and that doesn’t need 30 minutes a game or future picks that can be used in trade negotiations. Houston has a good problem right now. || We are going to have to reevaluate contracts under the new CBA. People are talking about everyone like they're going to need a max. That's not possible with everyone anymore. || I have no idea what the Pelicans are going to do.  We still haven't seen this team with a healthy Zion and a healthy BI and now they may lose both of them. || The formula for any championship team is looking more and more like two max contracts around a deep supporting cast on rookie or cheap contracts. I can speak for the magic that this is what they are aiming for with the suggs and wagner extensions || Lakers.  AD & LeBron have maxed out the lakers ceiling and it’s not a championship team.

Lakers have you decide to just go full rebuild and trade AD and Reeves or just be content being an above average team until LeBron retires || Houston and orlando both have to consolidate their rosters. They both have alot of young talent but both teams have alot of overlapping positions. Houston is especially hurt because they had the glut of talent and then went out and paid Dillon and Fred. Maybe a good option would be sending some young guys to Washington for valenciunes. Orlando same thing Anthony black is working out to Cole Anthony has to go. I think Moritz is worth keeping but they also have Wendell. They also went out and got kcp for some reason after paying Gary Harris. Pistons are another team in the same boat they have 1 PG 5 sg and 5 C || Can only really give my opinion on Orlando.

Our “Core” is P5, Franz, Suggs. We are developing AB nicely. He will be Core number 4.

Goga is extremely underrated and can be our starting C as a contender. And he on a cheap deal.

Moe will stick around as long as Franz stays put. Moe also cheap. Jett developing nicely but will essentially spend his time in Orlando as a cheap first rotation. Tds our rookie is one that was ready for NBA straight out of the blocks. Has a high floor, decent ceiling. Will develop some more and also be a handy first rotation guy.

A few guys like Judah are on cap friendly deals.

Kcp will do his 3yr stint with us then finish up i would say. Hopefully by 3rd yr he has been relegated to first rotation and we are running a Goga-P5-Franz-Suggs-Black starting line up. 

I assume we can keep our core, develop our first rotation guys that should be on cap friendly deals and move say WCJ-Cole-Caleb for a first rotation level back up pg.

So essentially, we should not have to make any “tough decisions” || It’s a tough decision or situation to have two all NBA players at like 23? Seems like something any Good GM can figure out. 

And the rockets paying Green was just awful. He’s their 8th best player and been bad for over 3 years now. It’s probably will be a dumb team that will over value him tho in a trade. If they had someone like Green who’s actually good they might be a contender || Orlando has Isaac, carter jr and suggs locked up till the summer of 2029. Blacks rookie deal runs till 2028. If there is one team that does not have to make any tough decision, it's Orlando.


Miami on the other hand has Butler becoming a free agent next summer. Do you trade him or run the risk of losing him for nothing? 


The Lakers and Bucks have an even higher payroll but have very little to offer to other teams. Your only options then become, hoping your star players stay happy or a complete rebuild.  || what choice do the magic have to do? they can pay all of their young core, they just don't have to do dumb moves like a big trade or signing a big FA, which they won't || OKC is going to have to make some tough decisions. There’s no way they’re going to be able to use all the picks they have and keep the roster they have right now. Having to many picks isn’t a bad problem to have. What do they decide to do with Chet? Two pretty rough injuries in 3 years (Broken foot as a big man and fractured hip). || Sixers, bucks, Lakers, definitely need to figure out what to do. Stars are either old or injuried or upset. || As a Houston fan I think they will have to make a trade, but I see people talking about trading their core for veterans which isn’t happening, they are a superstar away from finishing the rebuild project, and a lot of these comments have them trading amen and tari which isn’t happening, but it think their future will conclude with the team with the most issues and nobody here said anything about 

The suns are imo the team with the most trouble, way way over the cap with the highest payroll, no draft picks till 2031 other than a 2nd in 2026, so if they have another disappointing season, they have no way get reinforcements, so they either run it back which the same team while other teams are getting better, or totally start a rebuild and trade Booker and Durant 

I think if they go one or done or even get unlucky and injuries keep them out of the playoffs, they may blow it up and the rockets have tons of young assets and draft picks, I believe the rockets would be all over trading for Booker and that’s the final piece  || Los Pelicanos.   BI is a free agent at the end of the season.  I’ll get to Zion below, but do they have to re-sign BI now as a contingency plan?  BI’s ceiling is a first round playoff exit as your #1 option.  Can you justify paying the max for that?  If they don’t pay him, who will?  Pistons or Wiz?  What can Los Pelicanos expect in a trade for a hired gun for 2 months and playoffs?  2nd round picks?  

Zion’s trade request is coming soon.  Maybe not this season, but once he gets into that 2nd year of the extension like AD, it’s always time to move on from N.O.  The recent back tattoo video was embarrassing to him and the franchise.  The meme with Zion and LeBron 15 years apart was alarming without their shirts on.  Zion does not take training seriously and David Griffin has enabled Zion to get away with it all regardless of the safety contract provisions. 

Other roster issues:  Can Hawkins replace CJ?  Not as of now.  Hawk is a very poor defender and not nearly the shooter. 
Missi is a keeper. 
Murray would seem to steady the ship once he’s healthy. 
Murphy is an interesting case.  He’s a spot up shooter with some athleticism.  Good on ball defender.   But his value is less when he plays alongside BI and he cannot replace BI’s production when inserted into that role.  Maybe when Murray and Zion come back he’ll be unleashed. || 76ers and Bucks are the clear front-runners when it comes to making tough decisions. 

Both don't have any valuable picks, both have past-their-prime (or injury-riddled) star and role players.

Bucks are in a slightly better position, because Giannis is top 3 in terms of trade value if he wants to leave. Embiid's value has probably never been lower. Same with PG (especially after signing that crazy contract).

If Giannis wants to leave, Bucks can easily pivot from contender to top3 worst teams in the league. Only Dame might be difficult to trade for good value. || I think Jabari will end up being the odd man out in Houston. FVV and Dillon Brooks will be off the books in a year (FVV has a team option so they can terminate it earlier if they want). Amen, Sheppard and Eason have flashed the most potential and Jabari is the most replaceable to me. || Wizards need to figure out what they want to be. Until the league has a hard cap they’ll never sniff the luxury tax. They can get decent attendance if they can hover around .500 but they can’t do that even with John Wall Bradley Beale and friends… Jordan screwed us by creating a false identity. He thought he would just sign every guy he could that played in the ACC and we would win titles… it backfired and it’s never really recovered. They seem to like playing small ball but now there’s Sarrs… use it or lose it. I would get rid of anybody over around 27 years old for whatever I can get for them and concentrate on getting a solid swing 3 swing 4 and bruiser 5… I’d also probably move on from Jordan Poole, who is just way too 50-50 for me in exchange for a solid core role guy. That early 2000s team that the Bulls had was a great compilation of players… Deng, Noah, Heinrich, Nocieony, Boozer, Rose, etc… man they had a series in the playoffs against the Celtics that was out of this world.

Although it’s early in the season, it seems like Knicks are clear winners. However, I do think that there are a couple scenarios that could make this favorable to the Wolves: 
1. Upped production of Divincenzo. I will note I have watched maybe 1 twolves game but my understanding is that his production has been not very good and he’s been a let down thus far. 
2. Any injury to the Knick’s core group. Thibs keeps the rotation very tight and there is not a lot of depth on the Knick’s roster outside of starting 5 + McBride and they do have 2 players that I wouldn’t call injury prone but have had big injuries the past couple seasons (KAT, OG). Sure Robinson will come back and that will help, but I do think that an injury to one of their forwards or Hart and they could be feeling it pretty hard. || It's still really early. But as a Knicks fan I don't see any argument that in the short-term this trade looks like a huge win for the Knicks. This is clearly a much better offensive team. Their league best offensive rating does not look like a fluke, the lineup is stacked.  


 The Wolves also look to be in disarray. I think what it comes down to is that KAT is massively underrated. His unique skillset on offense practically guarantees an efficient offense. When he is at the 5 it's like a cheat code. But even at the 4 his floor stretching is still very valuable. Randle will never be as clean a fit because he plays slow and has a lot of poor possessions. I still think he gets too much hate but some criticism is certainly valid. But one offense, KAT is pretty much 100% upsode, I had no idea he was this good. || It is still early, but I still think Randle will continue to be a thorn in the side of Minnesota and that Minnesota closed their window with this trade. I assumed something like this would happen eventually, but I just thought it would happen after this season after the success they had last year and the pick of an older player that was expected to be ready early in Terrence Shannon and the move for Rob Dillingham. It looked like they were making win-now moves... then traded away their 2nd best player and the guy that has kind of been the main guy in Minnesota for almost a decade. || The trade was confusing from the jump, adding Julius Randle to the frontcourt with Gobert made zero basketball sense || Have you seen Randle chucking the ball at Gobert one play... And refusing to pass the next? Locker room alone... Knicks won || Right now, it looks like the Knicks won, but it's too early to know, KAT cap number might look different in a year or two

Not sure where you got that stat about guard/center 25ppg, but it happened last year with Embiid and Maxey || My assessment when the trade happened was that the Knicks would be good this season but look worse and worse every season over the next 2/3 years. And the Wolves would take a mild step back for now. 

And it kind of is playing out that way. But a lot of the Randle trade for the Wolves is marred by the fact that the core trio of Conley, DDV, and Jaden McDaniels have been playing very poorly to start the season. 

I happen to think both teams have a fair and equal chance of making the conference finals. Both conferences right now look difficult but have extreme parity after the Thunder, Mavs, Boston, and Cavs. || Wolves defense is almost back to being elite. Offensively if Conley isn't over the hill and if Donte/Jaden can make shots they'll be fine, but ""fine"" isn't as good as last year. Kat is just better than Randle and his chemistry with Gobert on both sides was better.


Knicks offense is elite, defense we'll see. They need Mitch. They're the winner so far || Why are people acting like Randle is playing badly or is a negative for Minnesota? He's having one of his best and most efficient seasons individually. Stylistically he might not be a perfect match for the rest of the squad, but he's holding up his end of the bargain by being the best version of himself at least, amd the Wolves knew what they were getting. || Knicks have the edge so far but since it was a multi player deal time will tell. The Wolves became a less competitive team overall and so far but we have to wait until season’s end to make a final decision. Randle isn’t guaranteed to resign w them and Donte looks like shit so far so again more time is needed. || People are way to quick to judge this trade tbh. 

The Wolves have fully re-established their defensive identity the last three games since the locker room boiled over. Yes, their record is bad right now but their point differential is pretty solid for a .500 team. 

If the last three games aren't a fluke and Randle bought in on the defensive end and chemistry issues ironed themselves out a bit, the wins will very quickly follow and the Wolves will be back in the playoffs. || [removed] || What bore out was what the majority of fans thought wolves lost, knicks won. The minority opinion that this made both teams better overrated Donte and expected him to be a 15-18ppg microwave scorer, which he just isnt.  || Knicks have the number 1 offense and is now 18th in defense. Getting precious has been a big gain. 

Wolves I still feel can get it together but too many strong personalities in the locker room || [removed] || [removed] || Knicks offense is humming and the defence looks a lot better the last few games over the last 10 or so games (particularly excluding the first celtics game). Precious, Mitch snd Landry coming back will help a lot with depth. || Trade can't really be judged properly until we see if they keep randle or flip him etc.

If knicks win a chip with Towns at any point next few years then they have to be the winners. And vice versa if wolves win with Ant.

Outside of that it's up to interpretation but so far Knicks are trending in the right direction.

I think wolves can be really good but not sure randle is a great fit at the 4 with Rudy. That seemed like an odd fit from the start. || All I know is I was trying to explain how it was a good trade for the Knicks and Knicks fans were ripping me apart for saying Randle was inconsistent and played selfish basketball lmao || I haven’t watched many Wolves games but I’ve read that Conley sucks now. If this is true then they should start Divincenzo @ the 1 and just put the ball in Ant’s hands full time. 

Divincenzo was killing it last year and probably didn’t want to leave NY to go to Minny and come off the bench. || You all are so funny.  4 wins in a row since Ant called the team out.  Donte is playing great, Mike is back, Rudy is amazing and Ant just dissected the Warriors defense.  Randle is playing defense and vibes are incredible. 

Kat’s is doing his best Bruce Banner impression and holding clowns back for now.  He will come out, and it will probably be in the playoffs.  Wolves fans saw it and know clowns well. 

Give this trade a full season before you decide whether someone won the trade. || Nearly every problem the Wolves have had - Weaker defense, bad Conley, DDV not shooting well, McDaniels regressing, bad team chemistry- has shown huge improvement over the last week. I think Knicks may have won it by a hair (if you take the cap situation completely out of the equation), but I don't think we can count out the strong possibility that the Timberwolves just had to go through a rough adjustment period before they could get back to business. As expected. || Depends on what Minny can flip Randle for. 

That move was always a two step process. We’ve only seen step on, so…TBD. || You can’t judge the trade after a few months. Minnesota didn’t make the trade for this season they partly wanted to get off KAT’s contract when he is due $57million in 26/27 and $61 million in 27/28.

It was always about the super-max which is ruinous to most teams. || I say this as the biggest Kat fan in the world. He was my favorite player since I’ve been an NBA fan (about 10 years). The results this year are irrelevant we had to move off the contract and got value pieces back. 

Wolves got exactly what they needed and Knicks are digging themselves a hole. That contract is an albatross. He’s gotta have MVP production to make it arguable that he’s worth it. He’s doing well now but every regular game he plays that he’s not the player of a game it’s a lost value || Precious is a underrated backup pf who can switch and play the 4 with turns at the 5. He pretty much covers towns weakness. 

Cam Payne has been amazing. 8/3 shooting 44% from 3 on 4 attempts. His defense surprises me the most. Unfortunately he got hurt. Knicks have a solid 9 man rotation once everyone gets healthy off the bench. || Also what will that FRP from the Knicks turn out to be? Wolves have some extra oomf if they wish to add another piece to the roster. || DDV has been pretty much unfiltered ass so far this season. There have been flashes, but not close to what he needs to be to say the Wolves didn’t get fleeced. 

It’s a long season, but as a lifelong Wolves fan, they’re a tough fucking watch 20 games in.

Since November 26th, the start of this five-game winning streak (including three games against elite offenses, mind you), [the Hawks rank ](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=11/26/2024&end=10/15/2025)[third](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=11/26/2024&end=10/15/2025)[ in defensive rating](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=11/26/2024&end=10/15/2025).

Third! Defense! The Hawks!

Last I checked, this is still the same team that gave up 133 points to the Wizards early in the season, but things have changed. It was never clearer than the fourth quarter of their win over Milwaukee. The Hawks [averaged less than a point per shot](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202412040MIL.html) in the ultimate period and took six fewer free throws than the Bucks. They still won the quarter 20-17.

Even this unexpected defensive surge isn’t happening the way you’d expect. The Hawks have been an excellent turnover-forcing team overall this season, thanks largely to Dyson Daniels (I went into more Daniels detail in naming him my [Perimeter Defender of the Quarter](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/first-quarter-awards-for-the-2024)), but they have been below-average in that regard during their win streak.

There is, of course, some shooting luck — but that cuts both ways. In the five recent games, [Hawks’ opponents have only shot 33% on triples](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/shots?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=11/26/2024&end=10/15/2025#tab-defense_shooting_accuracy) — but the Hawks only made 35%. (That partially makes up for the abysmal fortune the Hawks had for the first part of the season, as opponents shot nearly 41% from deep before the winning streak started).

Teams won’t always shoot that poorly, but it’s easy to construct a narrative that fits the recent numbers. Atlanta has a ton of length and energy on the roster. Rising star Jalen Johnson, rookie Zaccharie Risacher, and Daniels create a forest of grasping limbs for opposing ballhandlers and wings to navigate. It’s difficult to find Trae Young (trying harder on defense since Quin Snyder came to town, but still very bad) amidst all those trees. Even when opponents do get an open look, it’s not quite as safe as they think: \[[video GIF here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-hawks-are-exactly-where-we-expected)\]

Opponents naturally want to lunch on the Hawks’ weakest link, but there’s a little bit of a trap to hunting Young. The Hawks have the [second-worst points per possession allowed to ballhandlers](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/teams/54457dd3300969b132fcfe49/playtypes?seasonId=66ec94cbd172189f95bf08b2&competitionId=560100ac8dc7a24394b955ee&offense=false) out of the pick-and-roll, and they also give up that play type (and the similar dribble hand-off) at a very high rate.

But [ballhandlers shooting out of the pick-and-roll is actually the league’s least efficient action overall](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/how-differently-do-nba-teams-play). Atlanta's (and virtually every team’s) defensive principles prefer to give up the floater or the midrange in the pick-and-roll versus virtually any other shot. Even if it’s easier to do against Atlanta, it’s still a below-average possession overall.

In other words, teams can expose Young, and it can still lead to suboptimal offense. This is what it can look like in practice. Young gets drawn into the pick-and-roll and beat handily, but it still ends in a tricky floater as the other Hawks pack the paint: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-hawks-are-exactly-where-we-expected)\]

That’s not a bad look! NBA players have trained their whole lives to take and make open shots, and muscle memory takes over when they get a clean line of sight to the basket. But over the course of an entire game, taking five not-bad looks instead of five good ones can be the difference between winning and wondering what happened.

Schematically, the Hawks will switch all their wings, although they prefer to keep Young out of the action and center Clint Capela home in a drop. Their trademark is activity. Johnson, Daniels, Risacher, and even sixth man De’Andre Hunter of late are constantly scanning for opportunities to inject chaos into opposing offenses. They’re eager helpers, sometimes to a fault, and have a lot of faith in their ability to cover a whole lot of ground. If nothing else, effort is rarely a question. Look at how much distance Risacher has to cover for this monumental block: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-hawks-are-exactly-where-we-expected)\]

Although we all enjoy talking about the wings — they’re young and fun, two things that NBA fans love! — Capela deserves his flowers, too. Every year, rumors that he’ll be traded and/or surpassed on the depth chart by Onyeka Okongwu buzz around like repetitive, annoying mosquitoes, and every year, he grades out as an above-average drop rim-protector and vacuumer of rebounds who is simply too valuable to smash with a flyswatter, no matter how frustrating it is when he misses another bunny (there are a lot of parallels here with Phoenix’s Jusuf Nurkic, actually).

Okongwu is the off-speed pitch, the help-side shotblocker who can move his feet on the perimeter a little bit. The two are tag-teaming the center position while playing about equal minutes, and while neither is elite (Okongwu’s pick-and-roll defense has left me a little cold for years), there’s value in having different looks to throw at offenses.

For all that positive talk, the Hawks are still giving up more threes than anyone in the league, which is rarely a recipe for long-term success. But teams have also generally made them, and the season-long defensive rating is *still* 13th, thanks to turnovers and solid rim protection. It’s reasonable to think the Hawks’ defense could settle in around 10th going forward, which opens the door for Atlanta to make some noise if their offense can get in gear.

And they might be on the right path; the offense ranks seventh in this five-game streak (although just 15th on the year — worse than their defense). Like many people, I expected the Hawks to be an offense-first team, but most of their rotation has been colder than a Magic City beer. De’Andre Hunter has been lights out of late, Johnson is decent on mediocre volume, and deep rotation guy Garrison Matthews is a 46% shooter this season, but the team is suffering through poor marksmanship from nearly every other notable player.

The ballyhooed Daniels has been unable to find his touch, hitting just 29% from downtown (although he’s at least putting up four attempts per game, which is still low but more than ever before). Risacher has been extremely aggressive, putting up nearly nine triples per 100 possessions — that’s a great sign for his long-term development, but he’s also sub-30% from deep on the season. The usually reliable Bogdan Bogdanovic is barely netting a third of his attempts, and worst of all? Trae Young is batting like Marcell Ozuna; 30.6% (on huge volume) is by far the worst mark of his career. Young is only shooting 21% from deep during this five-game win streak!

*Some* of those guys will start hitting shots (Bogdanovic and Young, most likely), and when they do, the rest of the offense will follow. The team is also[ fifth-worst in turnover rate over this win streak](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=11/26/2024&end=10/15/2025); that can be cleaned up to a degree (and will further benefit their defense, too).

There are the bones of a really promising system here. Atlanta is [top-10 in both rim attempts and corner threes](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/shots#tab-offense_shooting_frequency). The Hawks run like hell — second in pace this season, [per Inpredictable](https://stats.inpredictable.com/nba/ssnTeamShot.php). They have a bevy of ballhandlers and passers, meaning most of the rotation can grab-and-go.

The Hawks are [third in assists and potential assists per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/passing?dir=D&sort=AST); they spread the ball around like butter on toast. But Young and Johnson deserve special mention.

For all the attention on Dyson Daniels’ attempt to get three steals per game, Young is chasing an arguably even more interesting statistical benchmark. He’s currently averaging 12.0 assists per game. If that holds, it would be [the most by a player in ](https://stathead.com/basketball/player-season-finder.cgi?request=1&year_min=1947&display_type=per_g&ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&cval%5B1%5D=12&cstat%5B1%5D=ast_per_g)[30 years](https://stathead.com/basketball/player-season-finder.cgi?request=1&year_min=1947&display_type=per_g&ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&cval%5B1%5D=12&cstat%5B1%5D=ast_per_g). John Stockton was the last to crack 12 dimes, and he did it in each of the first five years of the 90s. Nash, Rondo, Westbrook, the Point God himself — none of those guys had a full season with 12 assists per game.

It’s widely accepted that Jokic is the best passer in the league, and I’ve made that argument myself. Beyond his uncanny vision and feel, his height gives him sightlines few can access. But nobody possesses as much sheer passing talent inch-for-inch and pound-for-pound as Young. He’ll hit the lob, give defenders haircuts with bullets to sneaky cutters, throw off-handed skip passes right to a shooter’s pocket (Young’s ambidexterity as a passer is underrated). Most fun of all, he’s a master of improvisation: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-hawks-are-exactly-where-we-expected)\]

Next to him, Jalenn Johnson has emerged as a legitimate point forward. He takes full advantage of *his* height to launch pinpoint outside-inside dimes. When he’s feeling a little cheeky, he’ll launch a little hook pass that reminds me of Karl-Anthony Towns’ signature move (although Johnson is having a better passing season than Towns has ever had): \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-hawks-are-exactly-where-we-expected)\]

I sang Johnson’s praises before the season, when I predicted he’d be an All-Star. He’s been everything I hoped for, a well-rounded force who can impact the game in a multitude of ways. He’s averaging 20/10 and more than five assists, and he’s an above-average positional defender, too. He’s one of the few players equally comfortable on both ends of a pick-and-roll, and he’s even improved his three-point volume and accuracy each year of his career: 36% on 4.5 attempts per game ain’t Steph Curry, but it’s a functional weapon.

Risacher is still working on his marksmanship, but he’s already a savvy vet in nearly every other aspect of the game. He came into the league a strong defender, quick thinker, and instinctual cutter who knows how to catch even the best defenders off-guard: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-hawks-are-exactly-where-we-expected)\]

Thanks to an early-season injury to De’Andre Hunter, Risacher has started nearly every game this season, but it might’ve worked out better for the Hawks this way. Traditionally, Bogdan Bogdanovic has led the Hawks’ bench mob, but Hunter has been their best reserve of late. He’s been good enough off the pine this season that the Hawks would be wise to consider it a permanent move. This season, he’s averaging a career-high in scoring (18.7 points per game!), true shooting, steals, free-throw attempts, three-pointers attempted, and three-point percentage, all while playing the fewest minutes of his career. While Risacher starts, Hunter usually closes, which seems to be working just fine.

Fun fact: the Hawks are 7-0 when Hunter scores at least 15 points and 5-11 when he doesn’t play or scores fewer than 15.

To summarize: The Hawks’ shooters can’t hit shots. Their defense is better than their offense, and they start a rookie. Atlanta is playing differently than expected. Yet, at 12-11, they’re more or less where consensus thought they would be.

Nobody has had higher highs or lower lows this season. Is this team capable of consistently playing like the one that beat the Celtics and the Cavaliers? Or is this team closer to the one that gave the Wizards their only two wins of the season?

Only time can tell. The most likely outcome is that the Hawks hover around .500 for most of the year and try to avoid the play-in, notching some incredible victories and incomprehensible losses; basically, who they’ve been so far. But this isn’t really about this season. The team’s youthful core of Johnson, Risacher, Daniels, and Young (yes, I’m still including the 26-year-old with just one for-sure year left on his contract in their youthful core) has been a blast to watch and shown a lot of upside.

It is tempting to practice some [catoptromancy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catoptromancy)and see a Young-captained top-five offense complemented by switchable two-way wings charging through the East in the not-too-distant future. Is that recency bias?

Trae Young back in Madison Square Garden in a few days will be a blast. || Kudos to you for taking the time to write this. Very well thought out. I’m sure hawks fans will really appreciate it. They have a lot of young players that are playing well. It feels like they have been struggling to get over the hump since their eastern conference finals appearance, and I think you nailed why. If you are relying on shots to fall in order to win games, the team has flaws. Contenders will find a way to win games even if their opponent is out shooting them. They aren’t quite there yet, but they are on the rise again. || Hawks are the low seed team you do not want to run into in the East playoffs this year. They are winning with Trae having a pretty bad shooting year too. || Great read. Watching them play my bucks a few days ago and i was impressed by the number of athletic players they got. Dyson Daniels, Jalen Johnson, okongwu, even capela and risacher. They made the difference between them and our olkd ass team so obvious. Would hate to match up with them in the playoffs lol and not surprised they've beaten the best teams in the east || Well written piece. Great job. 

I have't checked the numbers for this but one factor I've found the last 5 years or so from the top defensive leagues have been that they prioritize protecting the paint and that they allow the most 3's from opposing teams. I wonder if there's data that correlates them. || I was rooting for them to actually have a losing a record coz of the there pick being owned by the Spurs but they are actually a really good team, especially when they got rid of Dejounte. || Yeah, like I mentioned, i picked him as the perimeter defender of the quarter. (I break up DPOY into two awards, because i think interior defenders are just fundamentally more important than perimeter ones, but I don't want perimeter defenders to be completely overshadowed, either.)

I'm not sure he can keep these ridiculous defensive playmaking rates up, but it sure has been fun to watch so far! || Even smart DPOY (which would’ve went to rob Williams if he played more games) he was on a great team defense team.

Dyson POA Defense has been disgusting (Celtic fan and the amount of times they had careless passes he tipped or stole had me screaming to try and attack literally anyone else) || Marcus Smart?

Thank you again for the kind feedback! || Thanks! Yeah, it's been a weird but overall good season so far. I feel like 12 months ago, it was all doom and gloom for Hawks fans, so this must be a refreshing change of pace. || totally. It's very matchup-dependent, but given how soft the rest of the middle is looking, I wouldn't want to face Atlanta either. || Thanks!

Next step a podcast. Do you have a knowledgeable friends or another content creator you can start one with?

Go for it! || The weirdness mostly comes from us being down 6 rotation players for the first 15 games of the season. 


Bogi and Kobe Bufkin both missed the first 15 games or so, Hunter missed 10 or 11 straight, Vit Krejci missed 10 or 11, Okongwu missed 5 or 6.


Trae, Jalen, and Dyson got run into the ground the first 10 games of the season and we were playing David Roddy starter minutes at the 3/4.

Jalen Brunson,"""Jalen Brunson"" OR ""Jalen"" OR ""Jalen Dime"" OR ""Brunson""",2024-12-09,nbadiscussion,1ha6fvi,What will the 2028 US Olympic team look like ,"People aren’t talking about how much pressure the 2028 team is going to face. The game continues to grow globally and more players from overseas are coming to the NBA. We already saw how Siberia or France almost beat us and the fact that the Olympics are going to take place in LA are going to cause a lot of pressure for the 2028 team to win it all

In terms of the 2024 team Lebron, KD, Steph, and Holiday are all going to be retired by then, I feel with his injury history AD will probably not be in the best shape in 2028 when he’s gonna be 35, same goes for Joel Embid, and I don’t know if Derrick White will do another Olympics considering we won gold and he’s gonna be 34 by then. That’s 7 spots that need to be replaced by then. The locks for 2028 assuming they don’t have a Derrick Rose level injury that alters their career I’m assuming are 

Jayson Tatum: This one doesn’t need much of an explanation. He didn’t play well this past Olympics but he’s gonna be 30 by 2028 and he’s Jayson Tatum 

Anthony Edwards: Again doesn’t need much explanation. Will be 27 by the next Olympics

Devin Booker: Will be 32 by the 2028 and I’d argue was the 3rd most impactful player for us in Paris 

Chet Holmgren: Chet will be the perfect fit for team USA because he won’t command the ball a ton. He’ll lock down the paint and can space the floor when asked. Not to mention Chet could develop even more before 2028 considering he’s only 22 at the moment

Paolo Banchero: I’m really high on Paolo and I feel like his inclusion on the 2028 team could be like Ant on this year’s team. I also feel like Paolo will be a top 10 player by this point if he doesn’t suffer a career altering injury so he would have to be on this team

Bam Adebayo: We’re gonna need another center outside of Chet and I’m confident Bam will still be good in 2028

Jalen Brunson: Would provide a good scoring punch and has a winning mentality. Would also be 32 by 2028 which means he could serve as a veteran leader 

Cade Cunningham: The Pistons are a terrible basketball team but Cade is a future star in my opinion. He’s averaging 22, 8, and 8 this year so I feel like either him or Brunson will be the starting PG in 2028

These are the only players that I would say are locks at the moment. That gives 4 spots that are open for players to earn. My question is 1. do you think my locks are good, and 2. who will make up the last 4 spots on the team. My prediction would be Tyrese Haliburton, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley, and Cooper Flagg/AJ Dybantsa. Tyrese Haliburton hasn’t had a great year but I’m still high on him as a player and think he’s a top 25 player in the league. Jalen Suggs would be in the Derrick White role as a role player who defends at a high level and can hit a 3 here and there. Evan Mobley will play center at moments when Chet or Bam need to rest, and Cooper/AJ is going to be in the young guy role that Tyrese had in Paris (if it’s Cooper I could see him playing more because of his defensive floor)

I also want to point out I would have put Jaylen Brown on here but unfortunately with the whole situation between him and Nike/Team USA I don’t feel like their gonna pick him with all that drama. Anyways leave your thoughts in the comments ",20,52,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ha6fvi/what_will_the_2028_us_olympic_team_look_like/,2024-12-09 05:00:16,"Jalen Williams will be on the 2028 US Men’s team I promise. He is a versatile do-it-all player that can guard 1-5 and has no ego. He has been one of the best players in the league this season on both ends of the ball and that’s still 3 1/2 years away from the next Olympics. By the time we get to 2028, JDub could be a top 10 player in the league. He’s super underrated on the national scale in my opinion. Playing as the second option behind perennial MVP candidate, SGA, will do that to you. If there’s been one silver lining to Chet’s injury, it’s been the blossoming of Jalen Williams. He’s improved in every major statistic. And his defense this year is other worldly. He averages 2.1spg. He is peak positionless basketball and could easily be a key asset to achieving gold in 2028. || Think the starting lineup will probably look something like Ja-Ant-Jalen Williams-Tatum-Chet. Ja is likely going to be the best American PG at that point in time (I don’t know what the likelihood is of Brunson still being this good in 4 years considering how small PGs tend to age into their 30s). There is no way Tyrese Haliburton is on this team if he continues to play the way he has for the last year. Could definitely see a guy like Steph Castle get picked to play that Jrue/Derrick White kind of role.

Definitely think guys like Jalen Johnson and Amen Thompson will be in the mix as well. Good players who can play a role off the bench. || Serbia, not Siberia. Spain, Canada, Australia, Greece, Slovenia, Lithuania, Argentina, Germany, France, Turkey etc. Basketball is worldwide sporta, second to football/soccer. 


Once again Jalen Williams got ignored. People still do not count on him and he is in shadow for OKC, but he is elite two way frontcourt player, delivering in all aspects of the game.

2. I would add Haliburton as Brunson replacement, Suggs, Jalen Williams, Cooper Flagg, and Evan Mobley.


Honestly the US are probably still fine. Kerr isn’t coaching anymore, so hopefully it’s gonna be Spo and I trust Spo to not get outcoached. If they’re not being outcoached then they’re not being beaten by any team unless US decides to be fucking lazy. Then there’s the US’s very deep talent pool.

Former DPOY with an insane variety of offensive moves. || Generally I agree. It's possible Haliburton won't have it. It's not to say he's an awful player, but just that there will be someone they like more that year, a role player on a championship, like Derrick White was. That said, they'll probably give him the benefit of the doubt since he was a good team player this last time around.

I'll bet you $1 that Bam Adebayo is not on the Olympic team in 4 years though. || How do you not put Mitchell on the squad?? Also fingers crossed cooper flagg comes to save us after losing kd LeBron and steph || It doesn't mattery, y'all won't even get a bronze medal. Remember what I said. This new generation of US players is not beating Germany, Serbia, France, Canada and Australia. Y'all won't get into semi finals. US has always played really bad when we talk about team basketball, but they always had the individual quality to simply score more threes and points in general than their opponents, and there are no more killers like MJ, Barkley, Kobe, LeBron, Wade, Curry, KD, these new kids from US are nowhere near the level of the best Euro guys, and that's the reason why they won't be able to win. It was obvious even on the last Olympics, Serbia played A LOT better team basketball than US basketball team, but as I said, individual quality of LeBron and Curry took over the control of the game and they simply scored more points. Not Ant, not Tatum, not Adebayo, not White, not Haliburton, not Booker, not AD. International teams were always better tactically and strategically than US, and all those international teams are on the same level, if not better when we talk about individual quality.

If the season ended today, he deserves a spot on an all-defense team. Every major statistic has gone up. He absolutely deserves a spot || Jdub can do everything on the floor. 3 level scorer, good playmaker, can defend 1-5. There are no holes in his game. He’s better than Jalen Suggs, Cooper Flagg, Devin Booker or Tyrese Haliburton. || Based on what I’ve seen from both of them in the FIBA/Olympics. I like Hali’s pass-first mentality over Brunson’s scoring. There’s already too many scorers on the team. || Lol who are you guys fielding? Coulibaly, Risacher, Salaun, Sarr, Yabusele, Wemby are the only competent players you can play, and even then Wemby’s the only all star there. Gobert, Batum, Fournier will be washed. Too many young guys who are at best NBA role players.


Meanwhile, USA can field Edwards/Booker/Tatum/Bam/Chet with Haliburton/Flagg/Mobley off the bench. Not to mention guys like Banchero, Smith Jr., Thompson twins, B. Miller, and other guys who played for USA Select Team.


Face it lil bro talent gap is still there lol || As a non-American, I can still safely say that the US will be a comfortable favourite to win gold provided they bring their A team & take it seriously. Which they have been doing when they redeemed themselves after having their pants pulled down in Athens.

France should be their closest threat, based on the talent level of players that are projected to be good in 2028. All other nations face their own question marks. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || “Competent”? What a foolish comment. Those are NBA players. The talent gap amongst amateurs is massive but between top level professionals, it absolutely is closing. USA needed 3 generational talents to close out Semi and Final. 

You talk about talent gap but how big is that talent gap between Steph/KD/Lebron compared to Tatum/Ant/Book? Don’t be silly brother.

Also, NBA achievements mean nothing in FIBA competition so to see you mention “all star” is laughable😂😂😂 || It’s a little scary. None of these team USA guys are elite elite.  Team USA will go from being prohibitive favorites with the absolute best players to in the mix with 3-4 other countries. || 1. It is not foolish to say that those dudes are competent but you need more than competent players to overcome the talent diff that team USA has. They cannot catch up to Ant, Book, Tatum, Adebayo, Holmgren with Hali, Wallace/Suggs, Flagg, and Mobley off the bench. Nobody cares about talent gap closing. It’s still not enough. You guys haven’t caught up and that’s the reality you have to face. It’s okay buddy. It’s okay to be inferior lol


2. talent gap between steph/kd/bron compared to Tatum/Ant/Book is a lot smaller than the talent gap between the best 2028 French roster and the best 2028 American roster.


3. If you were good enough in English, you’d have known that the way I worded my sentence was pretty nuanced but in case you didn’t pick up on it, I meant that being an all-star means that you are a higher level of player than just being competent, and those all stars are the guys you need to keep up with Team USA. Unfortunately for you guys, only Wemby fits the bill for now. Hoping that Coulibaly, Sarr, and Risacher (they all have decent skills and look okay for now, and I feel like they are in an upwards trajectory) somehow turn into all stars because it would lowkey make the game more exciting. || But who else besides France will challenge them?

Jalen Brunson,"""Jalen Brunson"" OR ""Jalen"" OR ""Jalen Dime"" OR ""Brunson""",2024-12-11,nbadiscussion,1hcq4ts,Trae Young's maturation,"When Trae Young was asked about the Hawks' struggles early in the 2021-22 season, he candidly admitted it was hard to stay motivated because the regular season felt much less exciting than the playoffs. A bold statement coming from a player with just one postseason appearance at the time.

Following an embarrassing playoff exit against Miami the same year, Trae chose to travel back alone rather than with his team, a move that raised eyebrows. However, the turning point came that summer. After the Hawks acquired Dejounte Murray and Trae welcomed the birth of his first child, he invited head coach Nate McMillan to his home to clear the air. The meeting proved successful, with McMillan later saying their relationship had never been better.

Though things ultimately didn’t work out in the end (Murray was a flop, front office basically went to war against the owner, everyone fired. Long story), it’s worth asking: how many stars in this league would set their ego aside and admit their faults to mend fences? Did LeBron attempt reconcile with Frank Vogel? Did Giannis reach out to Budenholzer?

Fast forward to this season, and Trae was asked to adjust his role significantly. A volume scorer used to dominating a heliocentric offense now being asked to shoot less, focus even more on playmaking, and continue improving defensively. While his shooting has been awful, the Hawks have achieved something they haven’t in years—fielding an above-average defense. Players like De’Andre Hunter and Jalen Johnson are stepping up offensively, and the team is winning games despite Trae’s shooting woes. This speaks volumes about his personal growth and the evolution of the team around him.

After tonight’s win against the Knicks, Trae said, “Every game is a big game for the team.” From being labeled selfish, immature, and a coach-killer, Trae Young is proving he’s more than what he was initially made out to be. While it's too early to tell whether or not this will lead to long term success, this level of maturation and sacrifice is exactly what every team wants to see from a franchise cornerstone.",259,45,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hcq4ts/trae_youngs_maturation/,2024-12-12 12:21:25,"I like that Trae hasn't been traded yet. I'm frankly tired of championship or bust mentality and would like to see good talent stay with their teams longer instead of beginning toxic complaining and not try to figure it out. || Lots of people still believe the ECF run was a fluke. If you watched those games you would know how good of a team that was, and how great Trae was. They were seriously looking good against the Bucks (eventual champs) until Trae rolled his ankle bad on a ref’s foot and wasn’t able to play. It was a different team to the Hawks now though. That team had great pick and roll offense with John Collins/Capela being constant lob threats. Shooting was great with Bogdonavic having his best season ever (probably best shooter in the league following All Star break), along with Kevin Huerter and Gallinari. But the defense and rebounding was lacking, and when Trae had an off night there wasn’t really someone to step up.

This new team excels at defense at the wing with Dyson Daniels and Risacher. Trae has upped his game there too, especially knowing he has help if he gets beat from one of the wings or Capela. His size is obviously always going to be something to think about, but he certainly puts in the effort and isn’t afraid to go for steals and deflections. 

The ball moves much more. Jalen Johnson can playmake and play a great 2 man with Trae. He also is a phenomenal rebounder. They’ve struggled shooting, but Bogi and Jalen are reliable, and De’Andre Hunter has really found his role as the 6th man, shooting 45% from three so far on 6 attempts a game, the most in his career. He also doesn’t need to shoulder much of the defensive burden for the entire game when he’s not starting. He does however close most games and looks great in the 4th quarter. 

Quin Snyder really has pushed this active, quick offense. The Hawks are 3rd in the league in pace. Jalen Johnson passes even more than Trae does. Risacher is great off ball, cutting to the basket and opening looks for him and his teammates. Trae is leading the league in assists. If Trae and some of the other guys can find a consistent shot, they’ll start being really dangerous. The big hole I see now in the team is the center position. Clint is fine, and I think lots of fans underrate him. But he’s slow, doesnt have much of a touch around the rim, and really brings nothing offensively other than a lob threat. Backup 5 Okongwu has a little more range but still is inconsistent, and has his own problems with rebounding, fouling, and defending. || He's been a really interesting player.  The claims against him: (1) Can't have a good defense when Trae is in the lineup; (2) Empty stats; (3) Not a winning style of play; (4) Ball hog; are all being disproven this season.  We're only a quarter of the way through the season so let's see what happens going forward, but traditional context needs to be updated by folks who have not watched very much ATL ball but have a knee-jerk reaction to him.  And agree, he has matured quite a bit, without losing his villainous entertainer edge.  Love him or hate him, he is a terrific and winning basketball player. || Giannis didn't have any beef with Bud. That was the front office, and they apparently didn't tell Giannis it was happening so he wouldn't feel responsible. || Hope he can lead a contender at some point, the Hawks have been so mediocre the last 3 years people seem to forget just how good Trae really is. If Luka wasn't in the league he'd be the best combination of scoring and playmaking from any guard in the league || He was actually playing defense last night against the Knicks and it makes all the difference in the world.  

This is why I find it so hard to believe that Luka will win a title before SGA. || First of all, this is an awesome post. I love these posts where I've kind of already made up my mind on something and someone makes a solid argument on why things may have changed and I should pay attention. That's what I love about this sub.


I've always felt Trae would be better as a Haliburton type (or at least the Haliburton of early last year - yikes!)


Trae's brilliant passing has been underrated. He sees two moves ahead, he gets so many value added assists. But I just don't think he's good enough to *also* be an elite scorer. 


His shooting will come back, no doubt. Not to elite efficiency levels, but to his usual levels. But given the talent around him, I think it's time to stop with some of the 30 foot pullups and whatnot. 


He had an incredibly selfish finish in the Laker game last week where he dribbled the air out of the ball in the final seconds of regulation and threw up a prayer. That's selfish, losing basketball - when Trae does it, when Luka does it, when Kobe used to do it. 


He ended up with the game winning shot in OT, but that was an open catch and shoot from his teammates. Exactly! You don't have to be the hero all the time. Trust your teammates! It's the only way to win - you're not Steph. || I want to add something regarding Dejounte Murray. After leaving the Spurs, we realized he isn’t as level-headed and calm as he seemed. A slew of bizarre statements and videos of him have made headlines, but I think the real problem with the Hawks/Dejounte trade lies elsewhere.

As the Hawks, you already have an All-Star point guard. Yet, just because this point guard has certain deficiencies (especially in defense and leadership), you go and acquire another borderline All-Star point guard. I was certain this odd experiment wouldn’t work, even when I didn’t consider Dejounte to have character issues. Tactically, there’s no logic or justification for playing two ball-dominant point guards side by side. The idea of using one while the other is off the court isn’t all that effective either, in my opinion.

They brought in another player at the same position and level because they couldn’t fully trust Trae. So, the fallout of this trade is partly Trae’s fault as well. It was obvious from the start that this plan wouldn’t work and that one of them would have to go. Ultimately, it’s not surprising that this situation became toxic for the Hawks.

Has Trae matured a bit as a result? Probably. I think he now understands the reasons behind the Dejounte trade. || Hawks have an above average defense because everybody around him is a good defender not necessarily because hes trying now lol. Guards who aren't good individually defensively can still have a good team defense if you surround them with the right pieces. The Hawks starting lineup is huge full of mobile wing sized guys with nobody smaller than 6""7 outside of Trae. That Dyson Daniels trade was also huge hes been playing DPOY level defense, hes been such a huge step up from Dejounte Murray. || I’m unaware of Lebron James and Frank Vogel having problems. Vogel was fired because the Lakers front office needed someone to blame for Russell Westbrook being a historically bad trade. We all know it wasn’t Vogel’s fault, and there was no reported animosity that I recall between Lebron and Vogel. They won a chip together, I am sure that is never forgotten. || That Murray trade was beyond awful. Murray is the definition of an empty stat player. Someone said that he was a great defender but didn't put in the effort/was misjudged. When your 2nd option is a guy that is a budget Ingram next to a Guard that barely matters in defense, I see no way in which taht team can compete for anything.

The current Hawks team is beyond amazing for Trae, if they had a starting Center that was a bit better than 30 yo Capela they definitely would be a guaranteed top team. They'll probably try to poach Ayton for a pick or two or a swap next year imo since the Hawks team is incredibly young and has insane synergy || Most of his shooting numbers are actually worse.   Maybe the worst in his career.  He just ticked above 30% from 3 and he’s under 40% FG.  That’s atrocious y’all.   In fact. At his current volume he’s the 3rd worst shooter in the nba.   High usage.  High turnovers.  He’s shooting a little less and passing more.    This is just not an all star. He’s a smidge above a replacement level player. || There was literally no reason to trade him ever, so it makes sense that it never happened. Why would the hawks trade away the best player to wear their jersey since Dominique Wilkins? || It's good that the hawks overperformed but weren't that good. It allowed them to get some picks such as risasher for example (Trae and wemby in Atlanta though 😢) I think the hawks much prefer Jalen Johnson and zach developing on the wings compared to bogey and Deandre no offense to those guys || Plus it's fun as hell to watch Trae on a nightly basis. Same with Ja, Zion - when they play.


If there's no obvious move for you and your star is still young, fuck it, play it out and see what happens. A teardown is going to take 5+ years - at best! 


The Pistons have been in a tear down mode for nearly 20 fucking years! Finally they have some young, exciting players. I personally doubt that this core will ever be a championship team, but damn, it's certainly not gonna happen this year, so give it some time! || This is well written and you’ve convinced me to watch this Hawks team. I’m not a huge fan of Trae Young but I recognize he’s good and it will be fun to watch his new emphasis on play along. || Couldn't have said it better myself. Lots of great points, especially about the ECF team. They were \*good\* on defense, I believe they were something like 12th def rating for the season? But what a lot of people don't realize is just how hot that team got after a VERY slow start; they were 14-20 to start the season, and then they finished the regular season on a 27-11 run to grab the 5th seed. As you said, Bogi went nuclear that year until his knee gave out, he definitely was the best shooter in the league for the second half of the season, but going into the playoffs he was essentially playing on one leg, and his shot went ice cold (hehe). 

I think the front office drank a little too much of their own kool-aid after that run, and instead of making some tough decisions on which players to retain, they decided to keep everyone and not make any substantial roster moves... which obviously did not work out very well, especially in the playoffs against Miami when they got exposed with essentially zero other players who could handle the ball outside of Trae. Miami swarmed him at half court, and the rest was history. They embarrassed him so badly that postseason that the Hawks went out and brought in DJM, who was obviously in hindsight not the greatest fit next to Trae. DJ had a lot of heart, but his defense in Atlanta was not as advertised... not very good on-ball defender, especially against bigger guards and wings, and gambled a bit too much on defense without the right supporting cast to make up for any mistakes. 

With all of that said, without DJ as a trade chip, we would not have been able to get Dyson for as cheap as we did. In the end, I think the Hawks got substantially more value back for DJ than they gave up in acquiring him. People claim they traded away 4 FRP, but looking a little closer, one of those FRP is the Charlotte pick that will convey as two 2RP in a couple years, and it's a toss-up as to whether that pick swap will convey. The meat and potatoes of what they gave up are the '25 and '27 FRP, and it's looking like those will fall in the 15-20 range, along with the two 2RP from Charlotte. In exchange, they got Dyson, a #8 overall pick, and a Laker's '25 pick that could very well fall in the late lottery, as well as a '27 pick that is like in the 15-30 range. Personally, I'm thrilled with the outcome, regardless of where the ATL '25 and '27 picks fall. The salty Spurs tears alone are worth it as they begin to realize they're not exactly getting top 5 picks for the next 3 years. || I've always loved his game.  The two negatives for me over the years were the lack of defensive effort and taking too many long or contested threes early in the shot clock.  He's playing defense and he's improved his shot selection.

Who doesn't want to play with an all-time playmaker who's got that dog in him defensively(now), takes smart shots, and can create and make huge shots when needed? || The way the schedule was drawn up, ATL is closer to 1/3 of the way through the season... they've played 26 games, about 31%. 

Some stats through 31% of the season for the Hawks:  
  
3rd in the league in team APG.  
Also, 2nd in SPG, 4th in RPG, 7th in FTA per game.

They're also generating some of the highest quality shots in the league. Not sure whether this is still the case, but as of 2-3 weeks ago they were generating the #1 highest quality shots, but converting those wide open looks at one of the lowest efficiencies in the league. Lately it seems they've been hitting some of those open shots. || Unpopular opinion but think we may have seen Lukas ceiling. Like unless his mentality and conditioning changes I don't really see where else he can go. || Kinda makes you wonder how/why New Orleans weren't able to tap into Daniels' defensive game more? He was hiding on the bench a lot of the time.

But yeah if it were a Daniels - Murray straight up swap, it would still be working out well for Atlanta. So getting Nance & draft capital is just a nice bonus, but having the Spurs control a few of your first rounders will still sting. || They actually don’t even have an above average defense like OP wrote, they’re currently 18th. And their offensive rating is just 18th as well, which is the worst it’s been in five seasons. They’re outperforming those ratings along with their point differential, so it remains to be seen if there’s a bit of fool’s gold going on.

I’m curious to see how the season plays out, but I feel like this may be a little early to write about him turning a corner. || I mentioned above, but without the Murray trade, I'm not sure they would have been able to get Dyson from the Pels. With a long-term view, I'd say it's almost always a good idea to bring in talent. Murray did the Hawks a huge favor signing that 4 year extension on a team-friendly deal, and that was the key to being able to acquire one of the best young wing defenders the league has seen in a long time. || I mean, superstars jump ships a lot in this age. If you read my comment, I assumed you'd see that am talking about superstars forcing trades, like AD, KD, Kyrie,and even Harden, etc. || Don’t disagree, but Iso Joe might like to have a word || To be fair, the Hawks also traded Dominique || the hawks are a fun team to watch, and have some good in-arena announcers (dominique is one of them) || I'm right there with you.  The offensive playmaking and the shot-making are already so elite.  He needs to improve the conditioning and defense. || The difference is that the Hawks have tapped in to his offensive game when the Pelicans couldn’t. Think of Dyson as more of a slight of build Zion on offense so he couldn’t really exist on the court as the same time as Zion or their other bigs for long amounts of time. On the Hawks he is used a lot in the short roll and makes a decision from there or from the ball on a swing which allows him to get the ball in motion and go towards the rim with some momentum. Since he isn’t effectively an entire negative on offense for the Hawks like he would be in the context of New Orleans offense he is able to stay on the court longer to allow more of his defense to be showcased like we are seeing now || They were injured heavily in the first 15 or so games. If you just take the last 8 games, the Hawks have a top 5 defense.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.106,0.776,0.118,0.5785,0.086,0.751,0.163,0.9998

Jaylen has started very poorly with a hip flexor injury. Has been better since but idk it’s probably close enough. Still 25 games does not a season make. Going forward I wouldn’t be surprised if jdub ends up as a better player; hell I semi expect it but a long time left for both players to prove themselves.

Edit: went and looked more closely to some stuff 

Counting stats are close enough but jdub has been more efficient so far and a better defender but the playoff track record for Jaylen still weighs heavily for many I expect.

But yes jdub has been better than Jaylen brown in these 25 games. I have no qualms saying that || Role matters. And how you can determine that role can generally be done through % of FGA assisted which can point to the relative difficulty of shots within their respective offensive systems. 

Jalen Williams is assisted on 46% of his 2 point shots and 81% of his 3s which are at career highs. 

Jaylen Brown is assisted on 35% of his 2 point shots and 71% of his 3s and close to career lows. 

We also see now that OKC has changed up their offense. They are taking a lot more 3s. They are 6th in attempts this season in 16th last season. 

While I think it's evidently clear that Jalen Williams is a better shooter, it's also obvious that right now OKC is producing more quality shots for Williams to capitalize on while Brown is tasked with creating more shots for himself. A person who is tasked with creating more shots for themselves is generally the better or more skilled player because a roles highest correlation is with that player's pure basketball ability.

This makes this a more uneven comparison. || Purely for the first 25 games, yes I'd say j-dub has performed better, especially given that he was basically playing centre for a few games. || Some people wanted to bring the excuse that one isn't a second option but both of them are second options on their team so no excuses can be made || I think there’s an argument that they’ve been at the same level on offense. Jalen has been more efficient but the okc offense craters without sga on the floor whereas Jaylen has carried second units pretty decently. But team context matters there and the Celtics supporting cast is more offensively slanted. Still it’s defense so far where Jdubb has separated himself this season. Jaylen had a career year last year on defense but has started inconsistent this season. The offensive efficiency and shooting I can’t really weigh that heavily cause it’s such a small sample still. || Yeah these are all good points. I had to take a deep breath and take off my green glasses after reading your comment. But in all seriousness, the combination of working through an injury to start the season along with a new role that’s more tailored to benefit Tatum has led to some inconsistency for Brown.

I need to watch more J-dub to see how his defense compares. Jaylen is lock down when he turns it on (just ask Luka), the problem is he carries such an offensive load for the team he doesn’t have the energy to be consistently dominant on both ends. With the amount of offensive firepower Boston has I kind of wish he would lean into his defense more.

The problem is even with the season White is having (and PP and others for that matter) those guys are really more like “star in their role” connective pieces than players who can do it on their own. You talk about Boston’s firepower, but it’s largely from beyond the 3pt line. And those guys benefit more from Jaylen’s gravity on drives than the other way around. || I’m a Celtics fan too fwiw so I’m not hating on my guy.

I hadn’t had much time to work on it recently, but now I want to discuss something in the NBA that I consider important but is persistently overlooked.

In NBA basketball, creative players who can create their own shots are undoubtedly valuable, and guards generally excel at this. However, especially in recent years, players of the type I will describe below have been overvalued, and many teams fall into this trap.


Here’s my description of the overrated (and I will explain why they are overrated) player type:
A guard, ball-dominant, usually short (6'4"" and under), a poor defender, and a good scorer.


Who are these players?


Russell Westbrook (although his prime is behind him, he was one of the best candidates for this profile at the time), Lillard, Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, James Harden, Cunningham, Bradley Beal, and the like. There are also lower-tier versions, such as Jalen Green, Collin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Malik Monk, D’angelo Russell, etc.

There have been many players of this type in history as well. From better examples like Steve Nash to others such as Starbury (Stephon Marbury), Steve Francis, Monta Ellis, Baron Davis, Gilbert Arenas, John Wall (not that bad defender but still fits the role) and many more…


The point is, no team in the modern era (and this also applies to earlier eras) has won a championship with this type of player as their number-one option. At best, they have made the Finals with very low success rates. Let’s take a look at point guards and players fitting this profile on Finals teams starting from the 1990s.


------------------

(OL means primary player / leader of offense) 


1991 - Chicago Bulls (PG John Paxson and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Los Angeles Lakers (PG Magic Johnson and OL James Worthy)
There was no such player. Paxson was a complementary piece. MJ was an exceptional defender and not small. Magic, on the other hand, was physically imposing and a pass-first player, never a scorer-first.

1992 - Chicago Bulls (PG John Paxson and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Portland Trail Blazers (PG Terry Porter and OL Clyde Drexler)
Same Chicago. For Portland, Terry Porter was a facilitator, and Drexler was the offensive leader.

1993 - Chicago Bulls (PG B.J. Armstrong and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Phoenix Suns (PG Kevin Johnson and OL Charles Barkley)
Same Chicago. KJ was the second option and not a primary scorer.

1994 - Houston Rockets (PG Kenny Smith and OL Hakeem Olajuwon) defeated New York Knicks (PG Derek Harper and OL Patrick Ewing)
Kenny was the third or even fourth offensive option. Derek Harper was similar.

1995 - Houston Rockets (PG Kenny Smith and OL Hakeem Olajuwon) defeated Orlando Magic (PG Anfernee Hardaway and OL Shaquille O’Neal)
Same Houston. Hardaway was both physically large and a pass-first player.

1996 - Chicago Bulls (PG Ron Harper and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Seattle SuperSonics (PG Gary Payton and OL Shawn Kemp)
Even with player changes, same Chicago. Gary Payton was ball-dominant but an excellent defender with no defensive liabilities.

1997 - Chicago Bulls (PG Ron Harper and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Utah Jazz (PG John Stockton and OL Karl Malone)
Same Chicago. Stockton was an exceptional facilitator, the god of pass-first players, and not a poor defender.

1998 - Chicago Bulls (PG Ron Harper and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Utah Jazz (PG John Stockton and OL Karl Malone)
Both teams remained the same.

1999 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Avery Johnson and OL Tim Duncan) defeated New York Knicks (PG Charlie Ward and OL Latrell Sprewell)
Avery Johnson was a good defender, not ball-dominant, and the fourth or fifth offensive option. Charlie Ward was similar.

2000 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Ron Harper and OL Shaquille O’Neal) defeated Indiana Pacers (PG Mark Jackson and OL Reggie Miller)
Ron Harper was perhaps the sixth option on offense, not ball-dominant, physically large, and a solid defender. Mark Jackson was pass-first, an excellent facilitator, and not scorer-first.

2001 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Shaquille O'Neal) defeated Philadelphia 76ers (PG Eric Snow and OL Allen Iverson)
Even with a player change, it was the same Lakers. Allen Iverson is one of the players I mentioned earlier, but he wasn’t as poor defensively as the others and had moved to the shooting guard position this season. They were able to make the Finals because he stopped playing as a point guard.

2002 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Shaquille O'Neal) defeated New Jersey Nets (PG Jason Kidd and OL Jason Kidd)
Same Lakers. Although I selected Kidd as the offensive leader, he was physically large, an excellent defender, and a pass-first player. He does not fit this profile.

2003 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Tim Duncan) defeated New Jersey Nets (PG Jason Kidd and OL Jason Kidd)
Parker fits this profile, but in the Spurs' excellent team system, he was never allowed to be ball-dominant as described, and he wasn’t the primary player. Same Nets.

2004 - Detroit Pistons (PG Chauncey Billups and OL Chauncey Billups) defeated Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Shaquille O'Neal)
Although Billups was the offensive leader, he wasn’t ball-dominant and was an excellent defender. Same Lakers.

2005 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Tim Duncan) defeated Detroit Pistons (PG Chauncey Billups and OL Richard Hamilton)
Same Spurs, same Pistons.

2006 - Miami Heat (PG Jason Williams and OL Dwyane Wade) defeated Dallas Mavericks (PG Jason Terry and OL Dirk Nowitzki)
Jason Williams was the fifth option on offense, while Jason Terry in Dallas was not ball-dominant, as their offense revolved around Nowitzki.

2007 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Tim Duncan) defeated Cleveland Cavaliers (PG Daniel Gibson and OL LeBron James)
Similar Spurs. Parker was more effective now, but the Spurs' system remained the same. Daniel Gibson? :)

2008 - Boston Celtics (PG Rajon Rondo and OL Paul Pierce) defeated Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Kobe Bryant)
Rondo was an excellent facilitator, pass-first, a poor scorer, and a good defender. Similar Lakers—no Shaq anymore, but Kobe is better now. Kobe was ball-dominant but physically large and a great defender.

2009 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Kobe Bryant) defeated Orlando Magic (PG Rafer Alston or Jameer Nelson and OL Dwight Howard)
Same Lakers. The two point guards I mentioned were not primary playmakers. The main playmaker was Hedo Turkoglu, a small forward standing at 6'8"".

2010 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Kobe Bryant) defeated Boston Celtics (PG Rajon Rondo and OL Paul Pierce)
Same Lakers. Same Boston.

2011 - Dallas Mavericks (PG Jason Kidd and OL Dirk Nowitzki) defeated Miami Heat (PG Mario Chalmers and OL LeBron James)
As mentioned earlier, Kidd’s role was even more reduced here. Again, LeBron—ball-dominant but physically large and an excellent defender when needed. Chalmers wasn’t even focused on being ball-dominant.

2012 - Miami Heat (PG Mario Chalmers and OL LeBron James) defeated Oklahoma City Thunder (PG Russell Westbrook and OL Kevin Durant)
Same Miami. This was the first time we saw the exact player type I described in the Finals (Westbrook). Even though, he was not primary offensive player but Durant. Harden was also on this team, but he wasn’t ball-dominant with Russ there.

2013 - Miami Heat (PG Mario Chalmers and OL LeBron James) defeated San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Tim Duncan)
Same Miami. Same Spurs.

2014 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Kawhi Leonard) defeated Miami Heat (PG Mario Chalmers and OL LeBron James)
Same for both. Parker was now even more effective, but the Spurs' system remained in place. Kawhi started to emerge as the main figure.

2015 - Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Stephen Curry) defeated Cleveland Cavaliers (PG Matthew Dellavedova and OL LeBron James)
You may have noticed that Curry doesn’t fit this profile. He is one of the rare all-time superstars who can dominate without being ball-dominant. Golden State’s system is already based on ball movement. Once again, another LeBron-led team. (I’ll talk about Kyrie next year.)

2016 - Cleveland Cavaliers (PG Kyrie Irving and OL LeBron James) defeated Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Stephen Curry)
Kyrie is an important detail here. Practically, Kyrie is the only player from this profile to win a championship as part of a title-winning team. However, even though I list Kyrie as the PG, the true playmaker was LeBron. While Kyrie was technically the starting point guard, his role was not playmaking but scoring through individual skills in tight situations. The team was not built around Kyrie. Instead, he was an excellent complementary piece and a great scorer.

2017 - Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Kevin Durant) defeated Cleveland Cavaliers (PG Kyrie Irving and OL LeBron James)
Same teams. Curry takes a step back.

2018 - Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Kevin Durant) defeated Cleveland Cavaliers (PG George Hill and OL LeBron James)
Same teams again.

2019 - Toronto Raptors (PG Kyle Lowry and OL Kawhi Leonard) defeated Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Stephen Curry)
Kyle Lowry was a solid facilitator, not a score-first player, and an excellent defender. Offensively, he was the third or, in some situations, even the fourth option. Same Golden State.

2020 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG LeBron James and OL LeBron James) defeated Miami Heat (PG Goran Dragić and OL Jimmy Butler)
Another LeBron James team versus a poor man’s LeBron James team (Butler). Dragic was the fourth offensive option.

2021 - Milwaukee Bucks (PG Jrue Holiday and OL Giannis Antetokounmpo) defeated Phoenix Suns (PG Chris Paul and OL Devin Booker)
Jrue was the third offensive option, not score-first, and an excellent defender. Chris Paul might seem to fit this profile, but he doesn’t because he is both pass-first and an exceptional facilitator and defender.

2022 - Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Stephen Curry) defeated Boston Celtics (PG Marcus Smart and OL Jayson Tatum)
Different but still the same Golden State. In Boston, no one fully took on the role of a true playmaker. Smart was essentially a big, defensive player and offensively the third or even fourth option.

2023 - Denver Nuggets (PG Jamal Murray and OL Nikola Jokić) defeated Miami Heat (PG Gabe Vincent and OL Jimmy Butler)
Everyone knows who the real playmaker is in Denver, right? On another team, Jamal Murray might have fit the profile described above. However, his ability to play off-ball alongside Jokic elevated him. Same Miami.

2024 - Boston Celtics (PG Jrue Holiday and OL Jayson Tatum) defeated Dallas Mavericks (PG Luka Dončić and OL Luka Dončić)
Same but improved Boston. Same Jrue. Luka “partially” fits this profile. However, he isn’t that small, which, despite being a poor defender, allows him to hold his own against bigger players.


-----------

As can be seen, no team with a player of the type I described has succeeded in a leading role. There are no exceptions. Only a handful of teams have even reached the Finals with such players. Even if a player of a similar profile exists on a championship team (and even this is rare), they are not in a leading role. They take on secondary, tertiary, or even lower offensive responsibilities. Another exception might be Iverson’s Philadelphia team, but even then, the key detail was Iverson transitioning to the shooting guard position, thereby reducing his ball dominance. I also reiterate that Iverson was not a terrible defender.

At one point, the Harden-led Rockets came very close to succeeding with this model. They could have become champions or at least reached the Finals, and they deserved it. However, they “didn’t.” The Golden State effect played a significant role here, but this type of player tends to wear down over extended series. You may recall Harden’s state during the closing moments of the elimination game against Golden State. Similarly, Luka’s struggles in the later stages of the playoffs have been evident for years. However, with Kyrie added to the team, they managed to reach the Finals (where Kyrie was again the secondary player). Can Luka ever win a championship as the leading player?

In my opinion, this is highly unlikely. While a rematch of last season’s Finals seems possible, I don’t think it will happen again. Even if they somehow manage it, I must reiterate that Luka doesn’t fully fit the profile of the players described above.

To summarize, the NBA has a significant number of players fitting this profile. In fact, finding pass-first American-born guards is almost impossible. Recently, Lonzo showed the ideal portrait of a point guard, but injuries interrupted his career. Garland somewhat fits this description; although he is an average or kinda weak defender, he can still play pass-first. Halliburton is  pretty weak defender but facilitator and undoubtedly a pass-first player. These two could play in the Finals or even win championships alongside elite scorers. De’Aaron Fox is also a candidate here. Over time, he has become less ball-dominant and isn’t a poor defender. Looking at it this way, Jalen Green needs to learn to play like Jamal Murray alongside Alperen Şengün. The more ball-dominant he becomes, the worse it will get, and Houston won't have a chance. On the other hand, SGA (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander) could win a championship with OKC. While he is a good scorer, he is not overly ball-dominant, and in addition to not being small, he is also an excellent defender.

The fascination with ball-dominant, scoring, poor-defending, physically small players in the NBA has led to these players being overvalued. Still, I am not claiming these players are worthless. For instance, Lillard, alongside McCollum, took his team to the Conference Finals. He kept people coming to games in Portland for years and won many games. For that reason, he is valuable.

However, he “isn’t that valuable.” He hasn’t won a championship or even reached the Finals. He never will. Perhaps one day, if he takes on a fourth or fifth role (e.g., Giannis stays in Milwaukee, the Bucks magically (!) find two elite offensie players or Middleton heals, and Lillard transitions to a pass-first role, hitting open shots, and his minutes drop to around 20 per game), he might achieve this.

I think Trae Young could succeed on the right team by tempering his scoring and ball dominance. For instance, in a Spurs team where Vassell has become an elite scorer, and Wemby is competing for the throne, Trae could find a place as an elite facilitator and third offensive option despite his terrible defense. For all the other similar players, the same formula applies. No player of this type has ever played a role on a championship-level team, nor has any of them ultimately succeeded. This is the reality of the NBA. 

In summary, it is very difficult for players of this type to reach the Finals. To achieve this, their roles must inevitably be reduced. Looking at those who have managed to do so, the viable scenarios are as follows:

* Continuing with playmaking but regressing to a second or, ideally, third offensive role (like Westbrook in the OKC Finals).

* Becoming less ball-dominant and transitioning to the shooting guard position (like Iverson or Kyrie).

* Improving their defense to eliminate being a liability, as they cannot physically grow larger (while there’s no example here, being able to at least hold their ground against certain types of players, like Luka, or Harden’s ability to do so in some cases, would suffice).

- You can't win with small guard who shoots a lot of threes (until 2015)
- You can't win with a big man that's not an elite rim protector (until 2023)

Versions of this were applied to individual players up until the moment they won, including Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant (as a first option). 

It reminds me of this xkcd comic on electoral precedents: https://xkcd.com/1122/

It's analysis that lacks imagination. I've never seen it happen, ergo it must not be possible. || Your initial assumptions are already flawed because you’ve already clumped together players who struggle on the other side of the floor. I think your conclusion can be, it’s harder to build with this archetype because It has been done before.

You need to back your thesis with empirical data, maybe Usage Rate for guards below 6’4. I would remove the defense part, because it would skew your data to favor the flawed conclusion in your post, and ask a question - what is the impact of one way offensive guards to winning a championship? Plenty of heavy usage guards are instrumental to winning championships, even Steve Nash was an Horry hip check away from winning.  Chris Paul is another good example. 

As for the purpose of this post, teams draft the best available player they can and hope they turn out into a good piece, and most times they turn out to be guards. Naturally, there are more guys below 6’4, and you hope for the best. If you were Detroit, would you pass on Cade (who is 6’6 btw) and say, “Data says, we can’t win around you and draft Jonathan Kuminga instead”. The Kwames, Darkos and Bargiannis of the world have suffered enough. || It *really* feels like you're starting from a conclusion, and trying to create evidence for it.

Firstly, why doesn't Steph Curry fit your definition? Is he too good at defense? Not ball dominant enough? How are you even defining ""offensive leader""? It's just the highest scorer?

You make caveats for Luka and Iverson and Harden, but really it feels like you're just hand waving away instances where your conclusion is wrong, or at least seriously flawed.

I do think it's an interesting topic, definitely worth discussion. Dean Oliver has written about similar concepts and I believe Cody Houdek, Scott Levine, and Evan Zucha have explored almost exactly this in their pod Sense and Scalability, calling it the ""wrong initiator"" problem. || Wow players that are great offensive players and defensive players win more than players that are limited.  This ""analysis"" ignores actual hard evidence too and instead tries to fit evidence into a hypothesis. 

I have no problem with the conclusion itself, but I mean its pretty much common sense by now. Its a piece of wisdom repeated on podcasts. ""you can't win a championship with a small guard as your best player"" Where do you think draft trends have gone in the last couple of years? || * *""...Curry doesn’t fit this profile. He is one of the rare all-time superstars who can dominate without being ball-dominant.""*
* *""As can be seen, no team with a player of the type I described has succeeded in a leading role. There are no exceptions.""*

Steph Curry is not an off-ball player—he’s not Klay Thompson. His usage rate and time of possession are comparable to LeBron’s. In 2016, Steph averaged 5.8 minutes on the ball per game, while LeBron averaged 5.3 minutes. You don’t put up 30 points and 7 assists without dominating the ball. Steph is a ball-dominant guard, short (6'4"" and under), a poor defender, and an elite scorer. He’s an exception.

* *""Kyrie is the only player from this profile to win a championship as part of a title-winning team. However, even though I list Kyrie as the PG, the true playmaker was LeBron. While Kyrie was technically the starting point guard, his role was not playmaking but scoring through individual skills in tight situations.""*

Playmaking was absolutely Kyrie's role. When LeBron sat, Kyrie took over as the primary playmaker, essentially stepping into the LeBron James role—balancing scoring and playmaking. Kyrie averaged 6 assists per game, proving he wasn’t just going 1-on-1 all the time. So this analysis is incorrect; Kyrie is an exception, much like Steph Curry. || The issue with heliocentric teams is that they have players who are that ball dominant because of lack of overall talent on the roster, and it catches up to them when they are up against better teams. Those teams losing isn’t an indictment on the playstyle, they ran into more talented teams. Teams that have more talent don’t have to rely on one guy so much. 

Ie: I am not sure the rockets play style is what caused CP3 to get hurt when they had the warriors on the ropes. || I mean yea. Players who r great at offense and defense tend to be better than players who r just great at offense. Steph curry showed that it’s possible to win w a small guard whose below avg defensively u just need to do great team building around him to make it work defensively. 

It worked with the warriors, many other teams r trying to replicate that. We’ll see if it works again. I think it will || Curry was a ball dominant guard before Kerr coached him. Mj was even more dominant before a strong coach stepped in. These incredible ball dominant players are difficult to coach bc if you just sit back, leu them be great, you still might make to conference finals or further. It takes real discipline to possibly take a step back for the overall goal. Not many franchises are smart and comfortable enough in their own skin to be firm yet not maniacal yelling to get a point across. Bc it’s not on the player to prop up lesser players, that’s the coach and organizations job || I think one of the major flaws in your reasoning is based on the sample we have available. One of the best weapons offensively-minded guards have is the three ball, which has only really become a focus of offences in roughly the past decade. So it’s hard to conclude it cannot work when, for the vast majority of the NBA’s existence, these kinds of guard have essentially been missing one of their best weapons.

Also, as a Bucks fan, your section about Dame confuses me. Whenever Giannis is on court, he’s happy to defer to him. He plays almost like a true PG then, moving the rock wherever it needs to go. He normally only takes the role of primary scorer when Giannis sits and we need a go-to offensive option. 

Holding his playoff record against him when he’s been part of some truly dreadful Blazers teams seems a bit unfair. Saying he needs to drop down to our fourth or fifth option makes absolutely no sense and, as stated, he’s already seemed to accept a pass-first role whenever Giannis is around. And him taking the lead in scoring when Giannis sits makes perfect sense. Who should we have ahead of him? Bobby? GTJ? The only reasonable answer is Middleton, who’s still returning from injury and has, for the time being, settled comfortably into a playmaking role || Love how this guy. Doesn't bring up the Detroit Piston which made it to the NBA Final 3 years in a row 88-90 won 89-90 back to back NBA Championship with Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumar, Dennis Rodman, John Salley, Rick Mahorn, Bill Lambeer and Mark Aguirre. || [removed] || [removed] || Do you mean guard or point guard?  
  
There are tons of people in this list that are ball-dominant shooting guards that won titles as the best player. Jordan, Kobe, Dwyane Wade, Curry, Magic Johnson. Yes, these weren't small players, but they all have very high usage rates, meaning they didn't necessarily bring the ball up the court, but the ball was in their hands a lot. And yes, Curry and Magic were point guards.

Also, the game has changed so that players that used to be shooting guards have been shifted to point guards to put the ball in the hands of the best play-maker more often. Jordan would 100% be a point guard in today's game as would Kobe and Wade.

Harden started as a shooting guard and guys like Cade Cunningham and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander would probably have not been point guards two decades ago. Probably Trae too.  
  
The only thing all these ""ball-dominant guards"" on your list have in common is that they didn't play with other elite superstars. The number of players that have actually led their teams to titles is very small. || >As can be seen, no team with a player of the type I described has succeeded in a leading role. There are no exceptions.

There simply hasn't been a good enough player of that type. You need absolutely transcendent offense to make up for the other shortcomings. 

Part of the story is that we haven't had all that much time with a model. Before Curry became an all-star in 2014, the conventional wisdom was that shooting too many threes wouldn't work in the playoffs. In hindsight, Steve Nash could have hit your profile, but he was curtailing his three point shooting because they didn't know any better.

>Another exception might be Iverson’s Philadelphia team, but even then, the key detail was Iverson transitioning to the shooting guard position, thereby reducing his ball dominance.

2001 Iverson led the league in usage rate. He was as ball dominant a player as they come.

>However, he “isn’t that valuable.” He hasn’t won a championship or even reached the Finals. He never will. Perhaps one day, if he takes on a fourth or fifth role (e.g., Giannis stays in Milwaukee, the Bucks magically (!) find two elite offensie players or Middleton heals, and Lillard transitions to a pass-first role, hitting open shots, and his minutes drop to around 20 per game), he might achieve this.

This doesn't make any sense. If you want a pass-first fourth option on offense, surely you want a better defender than Lillard.

Regarding Lillard's inability to make the finals, I'm less than fully confident prime Jordan takes the 2019 Blazers past the Warriors. || The discussion actually harks back on the principles of the Triangle offense, and the benefits of true team basketball.

Michael Jordan could probably be the greatest point guard of all time, and most likely win 0 championships if he was. There were stints before Phil came to coach the Bulls where Jordan was a dominant overall player, rebounding, passing, defense too. He could average as many assists and rebounds as LeBron if he wanted to. But that necessarily doesn't equate to winning basketball at the highest level, because ultimately basketball is a TEAM game and the best TEAMS win championships. Not the best players, not necessarily the most talented players, not the best ORTGs in the regular season, but the best TEAMS. 

This was what the Triangle did. It shifted the focus from making Jordan, a shooting guard, from leading the offense, from an offense where everyone is dependent on him to create everything, to an offense where people can create for themselves within the system and through their knowledge, IQ, and mastery of the flow of the Triangle. Something like the Triangle, or in other words, a self-sufficient flowing offense, gets more players involved without needing to heavily rely on a guard. And when players are more involved, they play better defense. 

A ball-dominant guard is in many ways the antithesis of team basketball. The guard who must create everything for everyone and will only pass to open players-- if you ever played with that at a basketball court you'd see how bad it really is, how less fun it is, because it's not too far off from isolation-focused basketball. Similar sentiment travels all the way up to the highest level of basketball. 

Not only that but there's and Xs and Os standpoint to it too. A ball-dominant guard operates at the top of the key. You inherently have fewer options to make a pass because there's fewer angles to work with. This is why playmaking forwards, centers, or big guards are generally more dangerous. By getting the ball to playmakers in the post, not only are they in a more deadly area to score, but they have many more angles, actions, and options to make a pass to a shooter or a cutter. They are harder to double as well because you can't hedge on some sort of PnR, you can't trap them above the three point line, and a post pass to them isn't that hard to make. This is what the Triangle, even the Spurs system, and the Warriors system depended on. They depended on Pippen to lead the Triangle, on Shaq and Gasol to playmake at their size, on Tim Duncan, on Draymond Green (who led the Warriors on assists). Big players who can playmake or pass make this system work, and they don't even need to dominate the ball. This is why Jokic, who is just as ball dominant as Luka or Harden, will come out with better success than those 2 come regular season or playoffs where his only inhibitions are actually his defense, not the function of their offense.

History over the last 30+ years has shown, big playmakers, motion offenses will result in better teams that perform at the highest level than teams led by ball-dominant players who operate at the top of the key.

LeBron James actually fits more into ball dominant guard than ball dominant forward, precisely because he prefers to operate from the top of the key as opposed to the post. It's a huge contributor to his inability to fit with a number of different types of players, which also contributes to poor Finals record despite having excellent amounts of talent for a very large majority of his career. || Sounds like a thinly failed anti Luka post when SGA has a higher usage rate. Where’s SGA playoff success if his style is so much better? || I don't know about ball dominance itself but short guards rarely win championships as the leading scorer.

People here might get upset and try to divert the conversation into something else (see: the top comment) but it's logical that the shorter players are going to struggle more against playoff caliber defenses.  The NBA is heavily predicated on height and athleticism.

Additionally, the small guards who are talented tend to be strong scorers and facilitators in the regular season that they they produce wins and make it difficult for the front office to acquire extra help via the draft.

So, between an All-Star PG type vs. an All-Star SF type, I think the latter is easier to build a contender with.  Otherwise, a championship squad is predicated on one MVP contender surrounded by three 17+ppg players (preferably, another All-Star among them....and you can substitute one dominant specialist like Ben Wallace/Draymond Green/Dennis Rodman here).....with 3/5 of the starters playing defense and a solid bench backing them up.  Great majority of championships squads throughout history have featured this.

Not rocket science here.  4/5 offensive outlets (including an MVP tier talent) and 3/5 defensive chokepoints means you bring what needs to be brought to a basketball team. || As constructed, Trae has a better shot of winning a title on the Hawks than on the Spurs. That's a fact. Vassell ain't winning no title as an ""elite scorer"" lol || I wouldn't say the archetype of player you're describing (that in my small NBA group chat are known as ""The Clarksons"") is being *overvalued*, I think scoring \~20 points regularly is still no small task, that's why teams keep paying players that can do that.

The alternative is moneyballing those 20ppg and that means getting a team together that fits perfectly within this strategy, and in basketball is way harder than baseball because you have less players.

So to me, the problem is just that they are not using these players in an effective way. For example, when you said:

>Russell Westbrook (although his prime is behind him, he was one of the best candidates for this profile at the time), Lillard, Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, James Harden, Cunningham, Bradley Beal, and the like. There are also lower-tier versions, such as Jalen Green, Collin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Malik Monk, D’angelo Russell, etc.

the ""lower-tier versions"" are actually the players that are being used correctly. You're not building your team or starting unit around Clarkson, Sexton, Monk, DLo. You're not asking them to guard the 2nd or 3rd best player on the opposing team, you're not asking them to lead. Those are specialists, you need them to score points and go back to sleep. Again, no small feat, and that's why they are employed.

The players that are in your first tier, didn't really have the right team around them. And It's not that the team was spending so much money on them, because they overvalued them and didn't have cap space left to surround them better, the problem to me still is that they are put into roles they don't fit, and because of that any analysis that the team makes to complete the rest of the team is fundamentally flawed. Like, let's go to a couple of examples from your list

Russ: The problem with Russ is that either he's uncoachable, or that he's just not smart, or that he gets easily carried away. I can talk about how he was surrounded, but the difference between him and the rest is that there's  a flaw in his character. The best way to use Russ at times, was to have him take a back seat and just move the ball around, but he'd just pull up, and that killed so many games for all teams he's been on.

Lillard: This is the best example of what I'm trying to explain. Lillard is a god tier scorer, but he's small, he can't AND won't try to defend, and he's not a real floor general. What does Portland do in this situation? For some reason, complete their backcourt with another identical player, but worse in every way, and keep it that way for years. He needed a backcourt partner and a wing that could defend at a high level, and overall players that would be comfortable moving the ball around. Like, ""Dame, you score we do the rest"". You mentioned Iverson moving to the SG spot being the key to that team's success, I disagree, the position is meaningless, the key is surrounding him with talent that fits. The team let him shoot a gazillion times, used a center that could score easy baskets and clean up around the rim, and had a 6th man who could step up and score when he sat down.

Trae: The only time the Hakws had a successful post season, It was a fluke. They haven't surrounded Trae with the type of player he would thrive on. He can lead the offense so he doesn't need another guy that can set the table for him, he does need (like any other player that can pass at a high, high level like him), shooters around him, and defenders so he can hide on D. The only thing the Hawks gave him was Dejounte who fell off a cliff defensively, and now Dyson Daniels who seems to be good for the role. He still needs a bunch of shooters, and a good big to run PnRs and at the moment, their big rotation is chaothic, nobody knows which center is the best, and both are sub-par centers overall.

To wrap it up because this is already too long, you're mentioning some examples of similar players that are good because they thrive off ball. I think this is more of a consequence than a cause. Kyrie, Jamal, Steph, they all have forwards or centers running the point. That's was I was mentioning above, they can't be ball dominant if someone else is setting the table, they have the freedom of movement they need, and if you have the scoring and assisting locked up, you can use the SG spot to get a plus defender.

You can win with any type of player if it's good enough, you just need to build a good team around him. || I definitely subscribe to this theory. There's a compelling mechanistic explanation. Deep in the playoffs, against other elite teams, most of the key differences cut against the player prototype you describe:

Increased physicality makes it harder for smaller, weaker plays to play long minutes. Increased defensive intensity and skill make it harder to maintain your offensive efficiency unless you have the physical size / strength advantage. Defenses scheme to disrupt your flow, particularly sending help, which is a lot easier for taller players (that can easily pass out of a double team / blitz) to deal with, even if you are an elite playmaker.

For players who are weaker defensively, offenses will hunt out mismatches, which also affects your ability to play long, effective minutes game after game.

The best devil's advocate argument I've seen is Steph Curry. Removing him, a lot of the players / teams that have fallen short have really been on the bad side of coin flips. Nash's Suns could have easily done it. Chris Paul & James Harden had some bad luck late in the playoffs. Devin Booker's Suns almost won a finals. || Learned this when the Celtics had IT, Kyrie and then Kemba. It doesn’t work in the playoffs unless you have an anomaly like Steph who is one of the greatest ever. || I actually really enjoy this take. It’s kind of common sense, but at least in the last decade, teams were really trying so hard to find their ball-dominant offensive guard.

I also believe there’s kind of a back-and-forth evolution causing the change. First, guards are encouraged to take 100% of offensive loads after 3-ball and PnR techniques matured. Then, teams countered by drafting mobile wings/ centers, as well as developing advanced defensive schemes. So now the remaining positions and teams have stepped up to the small ball game, and the ball-dominant guard offense became less effective. || Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Steph Curry are all ball dominant guards in their own way.  The players you're citing just aren't nearly as good as they are.  I think ""poor defender"" is doing a lot of work here.

If the best player on your team is Bradley Beal or LaMelo Ball, your team isn't very good.  That's not their fault, that's just poor roster construction.  That doesn't mean they can't be valuable contributors to a championship team. || i think everybody already knew about this. since ball dominant guards are basically the engine of the team and come playoffs everyone would just put a pressure on the engine and everything would fall apart.

what unrealistic for this is for a gm to convince a ball dominant guard to play with a restricted role. first off the salary just wont match unless you are a big market team that could just go over luxury, getting a superstar big/wing is harder when you have a superstar ball dominant guard since your team is guaranteed to not be shit (at least making the playoffs) so you wont get assets for trade and the only way a to get them is through free agency. convincing the guard to get lower salaries is just more unrealistic.

and damn do people really still think westbrook is a poor defender? hes nowhere near all defensive level, but just because of old age and one season of ballwatching defense (where he transitioned from playing with one of the best superstar in the league at the time to being fatigued all game while having to carry a whole team with no offensive weapon to playoffs) people really think hes a career shit defender. hes a decent on ball defender who gambles in passing lane a lot. you cant group him with the others. his case is definitely about shooting not defense, probably one of the most niche cases in nba history : losing his jumpshot overtime || It’s because they’re too small. Look at the history of Finals MVPs. How many point guards do you see on that list? Magic doesn’t count, he’s 6’9. You have IT, Chauncey, and Steph. 
3 guards who had the PERFECT team built for them. 3 outliers out of 80+ years of NBA basketball. 

When it’s the postseason, and the game slows down, there comes times where you NEED your star to get you a bucket. Ask yourselves, what is an easier shot: a 6’7+ guy attacking the rim for a layup, or a 6’1 guard trying to create an off balance jumper from the perimeter? Who in this situation will have an easier time getting themselves a good shot? There’s your answer to this question. || The highest success of this player is Allen iverson making it to the finals. But there is still no valid proof of success with these players. I often say they’re just putting up points. Not winning not necessarily competing but just dribbling and shooting and it goes in. || Ball dominance is good actually.

Most valuable offensive players (by actual data, not made up formulas), best offenses (especially in the playoffs) all skew towards ball-dominant players.

Being messi >>> being cr7

Ben Taylor theories don't actually matter it turns out u/[cihan2t](https://www.reddit.com/user/cihan2t/) || > A guard, ball-dominant, usually short (6'4"" and under), a poor defender, and a good scorer .. no team in the modern era (and this also applies to earlier eras) has won a championship with this type of player as their number-one option.

It's funny because this myth used to just be about small point guards but now we've weaseled in ""ball dominance"" and ""poor defense"". The former allows you to exclude Steph Curry's 4 rings.  The latter I guess lets you exclude a few others including Tony Parker (#1 option for a lot of Spurs teams) as well as a few others, notably some teams that lost the finals.  It's also worth mentioning that ""small"" was also a weasel word added to let the original criteria ignore Magic's 5 rings.  

All of these qualifiers also make the claims less surprising. There's 5 positions on the basketball court, you're taking a fraction of one of them and a tiny fraction of a second one.  Even if success has nothing to do with lead player archtype you're talking about a fairly small percentage of teams and so even over decades you're only going to expect a handful teams to be led by a guy with all these criteria.  

>  the modern era .. 1991 

1991 isn't the start of ""the modern era"" which is generally dated to post-Merger and/or the 3-point line and/or Bird/Magic era when the money took off.  1980 is a typical cutoff. Let's just be honest, **1991 is you cherry picking the endpoint to avoid the Bad Boys Pistons** full stop. There's also no reason to think that the 3 point era or merger made life harder for small ball dominant guards so let's evaluate this claim honestly and go back further: 

Russell's Celts were often led by small guards initially Cousy and Sharman/Ramsey, later KC and Sam Jones. Most were solid/good defenders *for their position*. 

Jojo White (6'3"") was arguably the #1 option for the '76 Celtics, decent defender.

Gus Williams was the #1 option for Seattle '78 and wasn't a good defender.  

Isiah Thomas was the #1 option for the Bad Boys Pistons and wasn't a good defender.

Tony Parker (6'2"") was the #1 options for the '14 Spurs and arguable in '07. He was for sure on the '13 team that was a second away. Overrated defense. 

Steph Curry's defense improved but looks better on paper due to second order offensive effects.  And while he is renowned for off-ball play he has the ball in his hands a lot more than people think. In 2016 he had higher Usage than James Harden. In 2021 he was higher than Trae Young or Dame (who he's right next to for career). || You lost me at Milwaukee trading Holiday to Boston for Lillard... that's not what happened lol.

2004 being an exception doesn’t erase the general rule. Look at the best player on title teams over the last 40 years at least, it’s a pretty damn elite group. The 04 Pistons are a wild exception, but an exception nonetheless


Nothing is full proof, but it’s hard to imagine a team having a real chance at the title without that.

Best offensive rating in the league, and 2nd best defensive team in the NBA. So that's done, number 1 is the Celtics. But who is claiming that number two spot? I'm going to disqualify any other eastern conference team from being 2nd. Just due to the fact that they would have to play the Celtics (Best team in the NBA) Feel free to have your own opinion and I encourage you to disagree! This is just how it works for me (I'm also an extreme Celtics fan) Last year I would have said the Timberwolves or the Nuggets, this year hell no. Both teams had a worse falloff than DaBaby in 2020. I know, bad. 
Is it the **Thunder? The Grizzlies?** Or the Trailblazers, jk they buns as usual.

**OKC** (I almost had a panic attack. While researching for the post I saw A. Wiggins on the roster of okc and then I clicked on the name and it said Aaron Wiggins, thought it was Andrew.)
Currently the OKC Thunder are equipped with a top 5 MVP candidate, Shai Gilgeois-Alexander, surrounding him with many great players, Jalen Williams who recently emerged as a 3 level threat with lots of steals to go with, averaging 20 ppg and 2.1 spg. Although, it's not all sunshine and rainbows, I have a few concerns with the newly emerged contenders; Injuries, Chet Homgren has only played in 10 games so far, same going with Isaiah Hartenstein, although they are doing alright in games without them. Another concern is the lack of scoring distribution, they only have 2 players who average at least 17 ppg, and with Chet or Hartenstein out they only have 3 people averaging 10+ points per game. But with the best Defense in the league that just about makes up for it.

**Memphis Grizzlies**
The Memphis Grizzlies have been out to an outstanding, and unexpected start, Ja Morant has been playing not as well as he is capable of, but the team has still been shining, intact Triple J is tied with Ja for PPG, the former defensive player of the year is averaging 1.8 blocks and 1.5 steals. Another great thing about the team is the points distribution, with 8 players averaging atleast 9 points per game. But just like any other team, there is flaws, Ja Morant has only played in 16 games so far, only 1 game more than Zach Edey, who looks like he needs to run the treadmill a bit. Ja Morant tovs, although a minor issue, 4 turnovers per game is nothing to laugh at, and can make a real difference when it counts. I will look forward to seeing that number hopefully drop down throughout the season.

**Dallas Mavericks** 
The Dallas Mavs were eliminated in the NBA Finals to the Celtics in a 4-1 statement victory for the Celtics last season, they look for revenge, they have a chance to get it. With Luka, Kyrie, Klay, PJ, and Daniel Gafford. Kyrie shooting a blistering hot 46.3% from the arc. Luka leading the team in points, rebounds, assists, and steals, which is nothing shy of incredible. A relatively low turnover rate at 13.9 per game. I would like to see Luka Doncić slow down on the three point attempts, averaging 10 attempts per game. It's not the most fun thing to watch, but it's working for him (35% from the three) a concern I have is allowing 50 paint points per game. To many iso plays, 11.2 per game. A very low net rating of 6.5, 5.5 down from the Thunder. Luka Doncic is averaging 21.9 shots per game, need to work on that, sometimes it looks as that Kyrie and Luka are on their own out there, creating for themselves, and getting double teamed. I have not watched many Mavs games this season, so correct me if I'm wrong here.

**Who is the team to beat in the east?** (conclusion)
With all of the things here, I believe that the OKC Thunder are the team to beat in the western conference, with 2 absolute buckets in Shai and Jalen. What really puts them over the top is the experience, and having a clear leader. I believe that having a leader can really help you in clutch moments. If they can stay healthy I believe that they will continue as the best team in the western conference.

**OKC Thunder is the team to beat**

Feel free to disagree with me, this is a discussion. Thank you for reading, enjoy the rest of your day!",1,11,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hg0ws0/who_is_the_2nd_team_to_beat/,2024-12-16 21:50:25,"1) If you don't know who Aaron Wiggins is (like the half-time woman at the NBA Cup Final who called him Andrew when the 'fit' (clothing) was being discussed, you're not the most qualified to judge this ;) 

That said, it is a question I've been pondering as well and Christmas-schedule means work is slow. 

Here's my take, Celtics are clear favourites, for good reason, if they can stay relatively healthy they just have the best roster. But it isn't as clear-cut as it was last year. 

I think the Cavs are going to be a real challenge for them, not just because they've started really well, but mainly because they are just much better coached this year. Atkinson was very good at the Nets and then spent time learning from Kerr and Lue, who are arguably two of the best in the league. 

The Knicks can't be dismissed either, I hate saying this, but if their 'big five' stays healthy and they somehow manage to find some depth through Robinson either returning or trading him, they have a good chance as well, their size gives the Celtics plenty to think about and Thibs knows how to make most out of set plays etc. Making them a fearsome opponent in the Play-offs. 

Then the Bucks have clearly clicked now. You can't dismiss a team with Giannis and Lillard, especially if Middleton is healthy for the play-offs (and yes, I loathe saying that as well). 

The West is much more tricky to judge, some of these teams just don't have the experience of a deep play-off run yet, I count OKC, the Grizz and the Rockets in that group, unpopular for sure, but I can't see them getting out against more experienced teams. Dallas could come out of the West again, but they haven't done enough to challenge Boston in the finals. The real threat is still the Nuggets, especially if they manage to make the rumoured trade. 

The final team is, surprisingly, GSW. Yes Steph is old, yes Draymond is old, but this group has found something that works and even if the current rotation is enormous, who cares? They won't play 12 man in the Play-offs and this is a great way to save mileage on the key players. 

My current dark horse therefore is GSW, but it is the Celtics to lose. || OKC is #2 in the league easily and the only team I think could beat healthy Boston. They currently have (statistically) the best defense in NBA history and a great offense despite missing Chet for a large chunk of the season. I don't think it's a stretch to say that, after Boston, they're the best team we've seen in the 2020s || Yeah agreed on the Aaron Wiggins thing, dead giveaway that OP isn't watching games and just spent a half hour clicking around on basketball reference || I agree on almost everything, but I just can’t get on GSW bandwagon, especially after this 2-8 recent stretch: that team is not beating Nuggets (who guards Jokic? Draymond who won’t even affect Joker’s shots? And then who defends the rim?), OKC or Dallas. I just don’t think Steph can play 40+ mpg at that level of intensity at his age, he can probably squeeze 35 really quality minutes per game in playoffs, but that 13 mpg period with him on the bench would be brutal against quality teams. There is a small chance Hield catches lighting in the bottle and then GSW can trade blows with the big-3 teams of the West.

If I were to pick a dark horse, I would still go with LAL provided LBJ gets a delivery of PEDs just before playoff lmao. Yes, Father’s time is undefeated, but Lebron can still turn it on in short bursts and his level of experience and poise can break younger teams like Rockets, Grizzlies or even OKC. If they get lucky with draw, avoid Nuggets (somebody else eliminates them) and face, say, OKC or Rockets in WCF, they can just make it to Finals. || Haha yeah. I stopped reading after the Aaron Wiggins thing. He lost his credibility right away. || It absolutely is a stretch to say that when they’ve had absolutely no success in the 2020s || That’s a huge stretch, but this season specifically OKC are the second best imo. But ngl they don’t seem a big threat to Celtics, I honestly think the bucks/sixers are bigger threats since they have huge star power but are always injured. Both Embiid and Giannis can absolutely dominate when healthy, and PG/Dame can get very hot when in rhythm. Also they have a third option in Maxey/middleton who can have pop off games now and then. Sure in terms of squad depth they’re both pretty dry, but in playoffs the stars are taking most the minutes anyways. || Nope, OKC might come out top of conference but they will wear themselves out from doing so whereas other teams who have got nothing to lose will start reserving themselves for the playoffs. The teams to be worried about right now are Nuggets, Clippers, Lakers and GSW. || None of those teams threaten OKC at all.

Jalen Brunson,"""Jalen Brunson"" OR ""Jalen"" OR ""Jalen Dime"" OR ""Brunson""",2024-12-15,nbadiscussion,1hetyi2,"Cade Cunningham is a star. To become a superstar, he has to fix two problems","Cade Cunningham is having a moment. But how high can he soar with two distinct weights dragging him back down to Earth?

In his fourth season (and first with a dedicated, competent NBA coach in JB Bickerstaff), the 6’6” point guard is putting up All-Star numbers: 23.6 points, 9.3 assists (third in the NBA!), and 7.3 rebounds per game on 45% shooting from the field. He’s also canning 38% of his 6.3 three-balls per game.

Cunningham’s most notable improvement is in his shot. The three-pointer was a major question mark for Cade coming into the year, but he’s shooting a career-high on both accuracy and volume, and it’s become a legitimate weapon. Importantly, the improvement has come across the board and supported a shift in how the shots are generated.

He's improved his catch-and-shoot accuracy from 37.1% last year to 42.0% this year and his pull-up three-pointer from 32.5% to 36.0%. However, his volume of catch-and-shoots has decreased from 3.4 to 2.3 per game, and his volume of pull-ups has doubled from 2.0 to 4.0

This is unusual! We often hear that coaches want star guards to take more catch-and-shoots because, for most players (including Cunningham), that’s the more efficient shot. The gravity of a team’s biggest star moving off-ball can free things up for lesser heavenly bodies, too. But Cunningham is doing far more self-made magic off the dribble than before and converting it at a very respectable rate.

In fact, that’s an overall trend in Motown: the Pistons are quickly resembling the kind of heliocentric offenses that have started to fall out of favor.

Everything flows through Cunningham. He is fourth in the league with[ 94.0 touches per gam](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/touches?dir=D&sort=TOUCHES)e, more than LaMelo Ball, Giannis Antetokounmpo, or Luka Doncic. He’s [sixth in passes per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing?dir=D&sort=PASSES_MADE), and his [34.9% usage rate](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4864#tab-offensive_overview) is fifth behind only Ball, Giannis, Ja Morant, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.

Despite the gaudy assist totals, I’m not sure Cunningham’s passing has improved so much as the team’s offensive personnel has (it must be nice to play with some veterans like Malik Beasley who are capable of making the occasional shot, although the team’s shooting is still lackluster overall). Dishing remains Cunningham’s best attribute. He has especially nice vision finding alleys for oops: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Cunningham is attacking the boards with a renewed vigor this season (personal aside: I love rebounding guards), and his defensive effort has dramatically improved from last season’s career-worst level. Coach Bickerstaff has always gotten the best from his players on that end, and Cunningham is no exception. He’s had some loud blocks, both of the chase-down variety and as the low-man help defender. This one on Antetokounmpo (followed by a sexy long-range bounce pass) deserved a comic-book-style “POW!”: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Bickerstaff hasn’t shied away from siccing Cunningham on talented ballhandlers, either. He’s been the primary defender on Jaylen Brown and Jalen Brunson, for two notable examples. While defensive tracking data is suspect at best, opponents have shot [4.2% worse than expected](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*cun) with Cunningham as the nearest defender (in the same neighborhood as Dillon Brooks, Draymond Green, and Evan Mobley, although I’m certainly not suggesting he’s on their level as a defender).

At this point, Cunningham is a bit too slow and inconsistent to be more than an average defender, but average is fine! He’s rarely the weak point offenses will attack — [teams have only targeted him 13 times in isolation](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/players/615e4bcfe771e94fc0e9eab4/playtypes?seasonId=66ec94cbd172189f95bf08b2&competitionId=non-exhibition-54457dce300969b132fcfb34&compsCategory=1&offense=false), far less on a per-game basis than last year. They prefer to go after juicier targets like Tim Hardaway Jr. or Tobias Harris (although Harris, in particular, has held up well in those situations). It is worth noting that Bickerstaff’s players have historically shown steady defensive growth across multiple seasons. Cunningham’s size and intelligence mean he could end up being a plus on that end.

Add it all up, and he’s carrying a two-ton made-in-Detroit SUV on his shoulders. It’s a heavy load for a fourth-year player, particularly one still with fewer than two full seasons of games under his belt. To Cunningham’s immense credit, he’s grown with his burden. His advanced metrics are at career-best levels, including an [EPM ](https://dunksandthrees.com/player/1630595)just outside the top decile of the league. [Andy Bailey’s Huge Nerd Index](https://x.com/AndrewDBailey/status/1866908831525290265), which averages seven prominent catch-all metrics, rates him as the 30th-best player in the league. Having turned 23 the day before Halloween, Cunningham is younger than every single player above him except two (albeit by a few weeks in some cases).

This is all fantastic news for the Detroit Pistons. They have a young, growing star on their hands. But to become a *superduperstar*, Cunningham has two last warts to freeze off. Both require a little context.

Everyone’s heard about Cunningham’s turnover problems at this point. He leads the league with 4.6 per game, a smidge higher than Young or Ball. Part of that is due to the sheer amount of playmaking that falls on the youngster. His actual [turnover rate of 15.6% ](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4864#tab-offensive_overview)is only 33rd percentile for point guards; in other words, below-average but far from league-worst.

My eyeballs see two major causes. First, he has to tighten up his handle. Cunningham’s ballhandling skill is high, but he can get careless with the rock. A low point was a recent game against the Pacers (an easy Detroit win, to be fair), when Jarace Walker snatched Cade’s cookies four separate times. He starts his crossover high and pushes through it slowly, giving good defenders time to jam him up: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Cunningham also routinely makes passes my toddler would call “silly” (and I’d call something else). At times, he predetermines his reads and can’t or won’t audible. His [8.3% turnover rate on drives](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives?CF=GP*GE*10&dir=D&sort=DRIVES) is the highest of anyone in the top 20 for drives per game (min. 10 games played), and inexplicable passes like this are part of the reason why: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Other times, he gets caught indecisively in the air, lofting balloons for opponents to snag by the string and merrily sprint away with: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Cunningham should outgrow some of these mistakes, but like any high-usage ballhandler, some will always remain. Turnovers, in and of themselves, aren’t always a bad thing, but I’d like to see more turnovers of aggression rather than meekness. He needs to excise the worst offenses to maximize his playmaking abilities. I am optimistic he will do so, particularly as the Pistons’ surrounding cast improves.

Cade’s second flaw is a little more nuanced. He’s struggled to finish at the hoop his entire career, and it hasn’t improved much over time. A third of his shots have come at the rack this season, a substantial number, but Cunningham [has never finished a season above 58% at the rim](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4864#tab-shooting_accuracy), an atrocious rate for a player his size.

A deeper statistical analysis reveals something interesting. Bball-Index’s proprietary formulas say Cunningham has elite finishing talent but is taking some of the hardest shots in the league when considering shot location and defensive presence (he is in the first percentile for “Rim Shot Quality”).

That’s a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it means Cade can generate and finish the difficult shots that all offenses require to a degree; on the other, it means he pretty much *only* takes difficult shots. Cade is a below-average athlete for someone who drives as much as he does, relying on craft and guile to worm into the paint. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen Cunningham redline his engine. The ability to play at his own pace is a skill, but he also never gets the blow-by layups that quicker counterparts can feast on.

He doesn’t have enough first-step quickness to explode past guys or vertical pop to elevate in traffic for big finishes (Cunningham has tallied just four dunks in 22 games this season). He is at his best when he remembers to use his size to bump a defender off their lane and extend over them for a layup. He loves to use a spin (full or half) to get a moment’s separation: [\[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Taller, slower point guards rarely excel in the paint; LaMelo and Lonzo Ball have famously struggled with the same issue. Cunningham isn’t likely to turn into the Roadrunner anytime soon, but there are ways for him to improve.

Can he get even stronger and bully smaller defenders? Cade doesn’t have a bulldog frame, but there is potential for him to fill out more. Can his three-point accuracy improve to the point that defenders have to stick tighter to him, allowing him to create bigger advantages with hesitations and shot fakes? Can he develop Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s airtight shake-and-bake handle? He’s been on-ball more than ever this year, but is there some latent cutting and off-ball savvy in his game? Cunningham’s also still working on his off-hand; he’s become *far* better driving left, but there’s still room for improvement.

A related note: finding a way to draw more free throws would help Cunningham’s efficiency immensely. Some fans believe he gets a bad whistle, but the truth is that he hasn’t been able to create off-the-dribble advantages that lead to compromised defenders. They have no reason to foul when they can bother the shot with a good contest.

Taking a step back, the fact that Cunningham can get to the rim as much as he does is promising; adding just a little more efficiency here would do wonders for his overall game. He’ll have to hit on at least one of the ideas above to do so.

The difference between stars and superstars is their ability to create high-level, efficient offense for themselves and their teammates. Cunningham has continually progressed in this area, and lineups with the point guard [have scored at league-median rates](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4864/lineups#tab-four_factors) despite below-average surrounding talent. But there isn’t a superstar in the league with as poor finishing numbers as Cunningham (at least, who doesn’t also draw free throws), and he simply must find a way to improve his rim scoring to reach his potential.

Cunningham has developed (and brought Detroit along with him) despite one of the worst basketball ecosystems in the league. For the first time since Cunningham was still in high school, the Pistons are respectably bad instead of a laughingstock (their *best* record in the last five years was 23-59; they’re on pace for 32 this season). Questions about Cunningham’s ceiling on a contender are beside the point; Cunningham is far from a finished product, and the Pistons have a lot of talent acquisition to go before they can start worrying about competing for home-court advantage in the playoffs. Cunningham has time and a clear roadmap for improvement. There are multiple routes he can travel to get to his destination, although he’s far from certain to get there. I’m excited to see which direction he takes.",304,48,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hetyi2/cade_cunningham_is_a_star_to_become_a_superstar/,2024-12-15 09:43:39," I want the kid to succeed.

I do think he’s improved quite a bit this year, but he’s more gone from top 200 player top top 80 player. But I wouldn’t bet on him ever being a top 15 player at this point || I was about to say minus the 8yr run or so of Billups & co. But thats been nearly 20yrs… Damn time flies || Yep. There are clear ways for him to get better around the rim, like I outlined, but it will be difficult for him to become elite. He's still so young in terms of raw age and game experience, though, so he's got a chance to figure it out. || Thanks, and totally agree! I've got a lot of ties to the Detroit area, so it's nice to see my Pistons fan friends finally getting pumped about the team again. || agreed. I think he has a super flexible skill set that would let him play with any number of stars, but a big forward with shooting/playmaking chops would of course be ideal (although how many of those guys are there?) || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || It's a reasonable view, albeit one I disagree with. I don't think it's likely he's ever a top-five guy or anything, but his ceiling is All-NBA. I really think it's hard to overstate how damaging starting his career under two coaches who didn't have the passion for coaching anymore was, so I don't want to dismiss the idea that he can make dramatic improvements with competent leadership (and better teammates). || To me Cade is 100% THE example of eye test needed because stats don’t tell even half the story. Until you have seen 100’s of his passes fly out of bounds bc the wing didn’t slide or a player just doesn’t catch the ball, it’s so hard to judge his ceiling. And that’s just one tiny example.

Jerami Grant, Bogey, Olynyk…Best players he’s played beside, and none overlapped. Wild.  || Out of the top 70 players according to VORP, only Fred VanVleet has a lower TS% than Cunningham.

The Pistons are 8-4 when Cunningham takes less than 20 shots in a game. They are 1-9 when he takes 20+ shots.

Detroit is better when Cunningham isn't shooting. || I think this is mostly because the team around him is so bad. They don't really have another creator, so he gotta do it all by himself. They should get some talent around him. || Truthfully I’m not sure the answer is on the roster yet. Not a big believer in Ivey as that kind of guy. || [removed] || Maybe! I am sympathetic to the discussion that superstardom is about fame more than play, although the two are obviously tightly intertwined. We’ll see if Cade can provide those moments as the team improves || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it.

Jalen Brunson,"""Jalen Brunson"" OR ""Jalen"" OR ""Jalen Dime"" OR ""Brunson""",2024-12-27,nbadiscussion,1hogf1q,Mock Early All-Star Rosters,"I was thinking today about how stacked the league is in terms of individual talent, and how there will be quite a few guys getting snubbed from the all-star rosters this year.

I tried to put together some early rosters based on my opinions and my estimates of how voting will go. I'll also include some notable snubs.

East:

G: **Jalen Brunson** - Bonafide superstar after last year with the New York market to back him up.

G: **Donovan Mitchell**- Best offensive player/most marketable player on a team on pace for 70+ wins.

F: **Jayson Tatum** - Known commodity having an excellent season

F: **Giannis Antetokounmpo** - Superstar arguably having his best individual season, likely best player in the east, leads the league in scoring and Bucks are hot.

C: **Karl Anthony-Towns** - With Embiid being in and out of the lineup KAT is likely the best center in the east, and he's been playing amazing as he meshes into new surroundings. Also has the New York Market.

B1: **Damian Lillard** - Popular vet having a great season.

B2: **Jaylen Brown** - Last year's Finals MVP who will lose his shit if he gets snubbed again after the Olympics.

B3: **Trae Young** - Trae is back to proper All-Star form after a few down years missing the weekend.

B4: **Evan Mobley** - Young big who has made the leap into a versatile legit weapon on both ends.

B5: **LaMelo Ball** - Honestly I'm not too sure about this one, he's averaging thirty but he is typically made out of glass so I think it will depend on how many games he plays in the coming weeks.

B6: **Cade Cunningham** - Young budding star with great counting stats and who's impressive maturity has helped turn Detroit around immensely.

B7: **Darius Garland** Great player on a team that I think deserves to get three guys into the game.

**EASTERN SNUBS** (in no particular order)

Mikal Bridges, 
OG Anunoby,
Jarrett Allen,
Scottie Barnes,
Derrick White,
RJ Barrett,
Scottie Barnes,
Tyrese Maxey,
Josh Hart,
Jalen Johnson,
Bam Adebayo,
Tyler Herro,
Tyrese Haliburton,
Pascal Siakam,
Jimmy Butler,
Brandon Miller,
Joel Embiid (Injured)
Paolo Banchero (Injured)
Franz Wagner (Injured)

I'd probably put Tyrese Maxey, Derrick White, RJ Barrett, Jarrett Allen, Jalen Johnson and Tyler Herro first up for injury reserves.

**WEST:**

G: **Shai-Gilgeous Alexander** - On here for obvious reasons

G: **Luka Doncic** - See above

F: **LeBron James** - Ah, this is a tricky one. Obviously fucking LeBron James will be an all-star game starter. And is he an all-star caliber player? Yes. Does every all-star caliber player get to be in the all-star game in the year 2024? No. Does LeBron objectively deserve to be an all-star starter this year? Probably not.

F: **Victor Wembanyama** - Everyone knew it was only a matter of time before this guy was at the very top of the league in terms of production, and here we are.

F: **Nikola Jokic** - An absurd basketball player

B1: **Anthony Davis** - The Lakers have a lot of problems, and Anthony Davis is only one of them sometimes. One of the biggest names in the league, he will be in the All-Star game.

B2: **Anthony Edwards** - Edwards has had a... weird season thus far. He has all but abandoned his athletic interior game to chick up threes on ridiculous efficiency. But is that what the Wolves need from him? Probably not. He will also be in the All-Star game.

B3: **Jaren Jackson Jr** - The Memphis Grizzlies are second in the West, so naturally I hear nothing about them ever. I was surprised to see that Jackson Jr. is their leading scorer. Maybe a Memphis fan can explain their success despite Ja and Bane having down years statistically. (Especially Bane, wtf is happening there?)

B4: **Kevin Durant** - Kevin Durant will be in the NBA All-Star game

B5: **Stephen Curry** - I honestly don't believe Curry deserves a spot this year, but see my entries for KD and Bron for an explanation.

B6: **Alperen Sengun** - Sengun is probably having a worse individual year than last year when at time she was heralded as the second coming of Jokic, but the Rockets have shot right to the top of the West this year and need a guy in the big game. I figure it should be Sengun, but again I literally never hear anything about the Rockets outside of Reddit and am not totally sure who their main guy is considering it seems that they have pretty consistent production across the roster and their top scorer Jalen Green is still the proto-type of AAU ball.

B7: **Kyrie Irving** - The last spot in the West was a tough decision. I gave it to Kyrie because he is having a great year, the Mavs are near the top of the West, he's coming off of a high publicity playoff run, and he is a known commodity in the league.

If you read this far congratulations. This has been a nice way to spend an hour. Let me know what your thoughts are.",97,60,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hogf1q/mock_early_allstar_rosters/,2024-12-28 16:57:33,"I'm really nibbling at the edges here, but snubs implies that they're having a great season and maybe only barely miss out on a spot. It doesn't mean a known good player who's scoring 20 a game or some prior All-Star. Maybe they're honorable mentions or sub All-Stars (a concept from Thinking Basketball), but they're not snubs.


For instance, I find it difficult to believe that the Pelicans get 4 players in the snub category with the worst record in the West. Green, Randle, and Gobert (as much as I liked his contributions with us) are not snubs either. 


Similar for the East. || Anthony Edwards is shooting 3s this season because the starting line up has Gobert, McDaniels, and Randle who all do not give him spacing to play an interior game. || I really agree with these. It's hard to get new blood in the game with all the legacy/ large market picks but that's just part of it for now. 

As a Grizzlies fan, Bane had an oblique injury early in the season and he just now seems to be shaking the rust off. Combine that with playing fewer minutes by design with a deep bench and his numbers are down. I'm not concerned. || I can explain the Memphis situation. JJJ massively improved when he was the only one healthy last season playing with literal G league players as his starting teammates. Ja keeps getting hurt every three games so he has missed a lot and is trying to focus on assisting more. Bane got an injury early season and is just now getting back to form. He was pretty bad for a while though. The Grizzlies are doing so well because during the offseason they fired almost all of the assistant coaches and brought in a ton of new ones. The new offense is all about sharing the ball and playing with the fastest pace in the NBA. Most games even the starters play under 30min because the philosophy is to always have fresh guys in the game. So far the Grizzlies have the best bench in the league and that’s why they keep winning even though Ja and Bane haven’t been at their best. Also drafting two rookies who are top 5 helps. Oh yeah and GG and Vince still haven’t even played yet. (Vince played two games but I’m not counting that.) || If you think Curry doesn’t deserve an Allstar nod this year, I will agree on that. But Allstar game is in San Francisco, his home turf. Plus, he is like top 2 in terms of popularity so I think he will still be an Allstar even though he is regressing. || Jalen Williams has to be in there, OKC are miles ahead in the West and deserve at least 2 All-Stars (and if Chet wasn't injured you could even make a case for 3 All-stars) || I think your East is probably close to what it will be (some of it is easy to predict – the East starters are already pretty much locked up). However, I think it will Herro instead of LaMelo. Coaches reward winning with the reserves. Heat are sixth right now, Hornets thirteenth. Heat will have someone. Bam is having a down year and there’s no way coaches reward Jimmy for whatever is going on with him. And Herro has been great. He’s having a crazy efficient year and has been good enough to deserve it. || I think your east lineup is great. I think Herro might sneak in, but that’s it. 

In the west, I think Harden should be an absolute lock, but because of politics he might miss it. He’s better than Sengun and Kai. Imo Sabonis, Fox, and maybe Book and JDub have also been better than those two. || Harden deserves it. I don’t think Dallas should have 2 all stars. Luka might miss it depending on the severity of his injury. 

As for the East, I don’t think Cleveland will get 3 all stars. I think Hali or Maxey gets in instead of Garland. || Sengun inclusion by a non biased Rockets fan is great to see. His game isn’t as flashy because of the Udokas system, but he’s way more effective overall which has contributed to team success. || Nice breakdown…pretty darn accurate…definitely hope Melo plays the rest of the games till ASG…he’s a joy to watch, makes me chuckle how much fun he’s having 🕊 || Agree with all except for Kyrie, I think JDub and Harden deserve it more than he does rn given that the league normally awards the top teams two all stars like last year with KAT and Ant and that a surprising team like the Clips would normally have an all star especially one thats a house hold name. 

Though I do not hate the selection and understand your reasoning for that || Focused mostly on your East lineup as I’m a Sixers homer. 

Lamelo entertaining AF and has played 22 games, def would keep him in.

I take the all star as popularity / the current season. So don’t care that Brown was finals MVP or would be upset, he’s on outside of the fence for me 

Josh hart as a snub what? 

I’d get Maxey in the mix - otherwise generally like the work (once again, am homer) || LaMelo is not an All-Star!! His team is 7-24. This is the Bradley Beal 2020 situation. 30 PPG on a bottom feeder on bad efficiency is not All-Star worthy. Also noteworthy that Beal shot 45% from the field and LaMelo is shooting 42%. Empty stats. || I agree on all of the above. My heart tells me that Lebron and Durant should be swapped, but I know that is unlikely.

Doesn't mean I won't keep voting for Tyrese and Pascal but after the start we had... Siakam has an argument but it is unlikely. || I will be shocked if Sengun makes the all-star game

He should behind Jalen Williams, Harden, Fox definitely and then probably behind Nooker, Morant and Powell || I would take Trae over Brunson for the first five this year. He is doing great as a playmaker with that young players around him. || Definite agree on curry arguably not deserving it, might put KD over Vic in the starters just due to fan vote and bc he’s still been very good this year || [removed] || [removed] || I’m glad you asked caused I dropped a video 2 weeks ago, a few minor tweaks 

https://youtu.be/MyZcJWoxE_k || Nice list, what shocked me the most is that Jaren Jackson is the leading scorer not Ja Morant! || He won't make it because of the injury, but Cam Thomas at least deserves a mention. || Its pretty crazy how many people don’t realize all star reserves aren’t selected by fan vote || yeah i definitely was rough around the edges with the snubs. forgot to mention i had a low bar for that. to be fair i literally added those three guys right before i posted lol just as an add-on || i will also say that despite narratives and team success, check out randle's shooting splits when you get the chance. his scoring his slightly down but it's not like he some bum already. || Him “chucking up” threes is literally what the wolves need from him lol || What was wrong with the Grizzlies assistant coaches? || Spot on, but I think a lot of Ja's games missed to injury are precautionary this year. || that is what is frustrating about legacy guys eating up spots. you can assume every year that injury will call for replacements. also swap him and kyrie and you get no argument from me.",0.483,0.517,0.0,-0.4215,0.064,0.836,0.1,0.9911,0.095,0.708,0.197,0.9995
Jalen Brunson,"""Jalen Brunson"" OR ""Jalen"" OR ""Jalen Dime"" OR ""Brunson""",2024-12-27,nbadiscussion,1hntybq,Grading Zaccharie Risacher's performance so far ,"Let's talk about the #1 pick for a moment, the least hyped #1 pick in recent memory, and grade how he's been on both sides of the ball.

# Defense

This is where Risacher shines. If there was a ""Defensive Rookie of the Year"" then Risacher would be the favorite in my eyes. Risacher and Dyson Daniels together form a top 5 wing defense in the league. But why is the Rizzler's defense so good?

His ""secret sauce"" is almost identical to Dyson. Mobility + length + strength. Risacher has:

1. The quickness to stay with some of the most dynamic opponents in the league
2. The length to contest shots from a majority of players
3. The strength to fight through and navigate screens

This allows Risacher to be a great on ball defender. But Zaccharie is also a very impactful offball and help defender. His acute awareness along with his secret sauce allows him to constantly hound the offense by sliding into passing lanes and drives with the ball. The Hawks' solid interior defense and length help keep ball handlers at the midrange+ distance where Risacher loves to hunt for steals and deflections.

He's not perfect, of course. First, he isn't the best rebounder, despite his height and length. Additionally, he is quite young at 19 years old, and is lacking the mass it takes to wall off opposing players, specifically when they are: a) going down hill, b) a big player posting him up, or c) boxing him out for a rebound. And sometimes he can get beat on the catch, and fall behind his man. So although he is strong and quick *enough* to be a very impactful defender, he still falls a bit short when dealing with the quickest and strongest of what the league has to offer. Risacher would definitely benefit from bulking up and putting on some weight.

I'd give him a **B+** on defense so far this season.

# Offense

Let's get this out of the way: He has been shooting like shit. His FG% is 39.6% and his 3P% is 28.1%, pretty dismal. Out of the 50 rookies playing this season, Zaccharie is 45^(th) in FG% and 32^(nd) in 3P%.

Is this cause for concern? I don't think so, at least not yet. Rookies often have a tough time shooting as they adjust to NBA defenses. There's also the mental game that many rookies have to work through. Luckily (for his progression not the Hawks' score), Risacher still doesn't hesitate to shoot open looks. His shooting motion is smooth and difficult to contest. Also, I can't be the only one to notice that sooooo many of his shots either rim out or just get unlucky bounces. Maybe that's my bias showing.

He is not great at involving teammates. His passing and assist numbers are pretty low despite being 9th in total minutes among rookies. He seems to get a bit tunnel visioned with the ball. He does show some promise in kicking out if he gets walled off during a drive, but lacks the ball protection to do this consistently. That leads us to his other major offensive negative.

His ball handling has been lackluster. It's a bit funny because although he is great defensively at helping during drives to the basket, when it's his turn to be in that position he can pretty easily turn over the ball and lose sight of help defense. He often doesn't use his body to put space between him and defenders, leaving the ball more open to disruption which fucks with his game.

But let's talk about his positives which I think are nothing to discredit just because of his poor shooting and ball protection. He is a GREAT cutter to the basket. Whether its off of a pick and roll or in transition, Zaccharie is constantly moving off ball and freeing himself up for easy looks at the basket. This is often rewarded by either Trae or Jalen Johnson.

And even though his 3 point shot hasn't been falling, he's shown a good ability to push past the closeout defender and attack help defense at the rim. If he can get his shot to start falling it'll only make this move even deadlier and it'll force stronger closeouts leading to more open lanes. His speed helps here. Risacher is 5^(th) among rookies in average speed.

All around he gets a **C-** on offense so far this season.

# TL;DR:

It's not hard to see why Risacher has been a bit of a disappointment for fans of the Hawks. It's tough seeing your #1 pick struggle to shoot, dribble, and rebound. But he has made his own impact on his team, fitting very nicely into a role with a quite good young Atlanta team by playing great defense and by showing great awareness on both sides of the ball. And with some more experience and training, he could start to be a really valuable player. All-in-all, Zaccharie Risacher gets a C+/B- for the season.

What are your thoughts on Risacher? Anything I missed?",113,31,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hntybq/grading_zaccharie_risachers_performance_so_far/,2024-12-27 19:59:07,"Was last night’s game an outlier? I haven’t watched much Hawks, but I watched some of last night’s game this morning and my impression was that Risacher was a pretty bad defender. Seemed to offer very little resistant 1v1 and didnt look great as a help defender either. || As a Hawks fan, I think his biggest issue is just shooting the ball. Using the Bulls game as an example, he (and Dyson) looked terrified to shoot in the first half. In the second half Zacch took more shots and got in a rhythm. He defers too much to everyone on the court when he and Dyson should both be hoisting up shots only behind Trae/Jalen/Dre depending on lineup.

I think he could definitely benefit from a few cutting drives to to basket to get him going. They did that more earlier in the season and got away from it. || I think he can be a quality catch and shoot wing at his full potential. He is capable of shooting better than he is currently and can become a very good defender. But I don't think he can become a shot creating star player at this level.

It was a weak draft, and I don't think it's fair to the player to expect him to have a similar trajectory as other Number 1 selections. || Hasn't really been good so far, but that's not to say he won't be in future. DeAndre Hunter's sudden uptick in scoring ability and Dyson Daniels' defensive value will put the brakes on Risacher's development via minutes and touches, but if he stays engaged and the Hawks are patient, he'll be a good player for them in the future. || Always thought of him as a high floor, low ceiling player. I thought he could be a decent 3D player if he reached his full potential but not a first or second option on a contender. I think this is par for the course so far as a rookie.  || Damn didn't know the [The Rizzler](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCQG1H8MuzV/?igsh=MTd0N2FxeWRxM2hkYw==) was also an NBA player. || Not much of his fault this season, but I see him as one of the best starting role players in the future. He is super quick, can blow by defense when he wants to, can guard and has good frame and size. He is still very raw, but I see the vision. || Now I really want to see what the french team could possibly look like on the defensive end with RIsacher, Coulibaly and Wembanyama... Thanks for the insights since I'm not able to watch many Hawks games. || Ngl i think he is one of those players that wont become good till their 6th-7th season and at most like a Prime Harrison Barnes || Nobody even cares about how lackluster the kid is because all anyone focused on was the 55th pick. Hate is a drug 

The shooting percentage will improve, and the lack of passing doesn’t mean anything with Trae on the team.

I think he’ll contribute more later || I wanted to come back to this discussion because I have another thought. Normally the #1 pick goes to a team that is horrible and is willing to either give the player unlimited reign because of a lack of talent around them 


Zacch is on a team that has made the playoffs, albeit through the play-in, and has multiple talented players around him. His growth doesn't have to come as fast as the usual #1 pick. The Hawks and Zacch can afford to let him develop more naturally. He doesn't need to be the best player and franchise savior today. He can be an All-Star player with timely development over a longer timeline. || When you describe a rookie who can’t shoot, dribble or pass… I get flashbacks of Jan vesely. Similarly sized wing whose greatest strength is length, quickness, cutting, defense. || Mostly agreed OP.  Have only caught a handful of Hawks games this year, and Risacher hasn’t stood out much in the games I’ve seen, but you can see some potential there.

Agreed that he’s already a good defender, and I see the potential for him to be VERY good, as he gains experience and gets stronger.  He’s long, moves his feet well, has good defensive instincts and puts in the effort on D.

Offensively, it’s super early, but in the games I’ve seen I don’t get star scorer vibes.  His handle looks mediocre, doesn’t have much of a 1 on 1 game, and doesn’t have overwhelming athleticism/strength.  But he’s got solid form on his shot, quick and smooth release, the shooting woes should be temporary.  Combined with very good length and good quickness, good decision making (for a rookie), I can totally see him being a strong movement and spot up shooter with time, who is also good cutting/rolling to the basket, or driving when his defender bites on shot fakes.  But also it’s super early to project, and if he improves the handle a bunch, adds some quality 1 on 1 moves, gets stronger and more explosive, who knows!  Maybe he’s got 1st/2nd option in him, though from what I’ve seen so far, my guess would be that 3rd/4th option is more likely.

Overall, if I had to give a best guess for his future, I’d say … maybe somewhere in the Batum/OG range?  But again, it’s SO early, he could easily end up better OR worse than that. || This guy has never heard of Jaylen Wells or Zach Edey. Both rookies who have been exceptional in their defensive roles. Wells held Steph to 2 points. || Last night was more of an outlier imo, been significantly better on the defensive end than last night, good hustle, just got 19 year old muscle mass, the fundamentals are there in terms of defensive engagement and instincts. I'm biased cause I'm a Hawks fan tho. || [removed] || For much of the season Risacher had the best defensive rating on a team where Dyson Daniels exists. I’m not a big proponent of using advanced defensive stats, but it matches the eye test. He has elite footwork, great body control and positioning, and when he adds a few more pounds I expect him to be able to guard 1-5 similar to Jalen Johnson. 

Post draft the Hawks were talking about their plan to use him as a 6’10” shooting guard. I agree with OP that if they’re not already top 5 wing defensive duo then by next season Dyson + Risacher will be. || Outlier.  Heats scheme just results in dudes getting open bc of their ball movement and discipline.  He’s not capable of making those complex reads against a team as well coached as the Heat consistently.  But generally I’d say he’s been a good help defender and a decent 1v1 defender.  It’s not uncommon for rookies to be good at 1v1 defense but it’s extremely uncommon for them to be good at help/team defense this early.  He’s already an above average defender in this league which is awesome.  His problem is his offense atm.  Outside being an excellent cutter/off ball mover in general he just doesn’t have the skill to do a lot with the ball in his hands and his shot just ain’t falling despite looking pretty fluid.  Hes got the potential to have great touch around the rim tho as he’s made some nice floaters/finishes but still doesn’t have the strength to A) get there and B) finish there consistently.  I’d also argue strength is probably his biggest weakness on defense too outside the rookie mistake kinda plays || I wasn’t able to catch the game last night outside of the 4th quarter, so I can’t speak to it. He might’ve had an off game defensively, but it does look like he had a fine game box score wise. || Na dude he’s ass. Idk what they are talking about that he’s good on defense. He’s not very strong and doesn’t have a quick jump to block shots. He’s supposed to be an offensive guy || Hawks didn’t draft him to be their savior luckily.  If all he is is an above average 3 and D wing then that’s a win in my book. || I don’t think Dyson or Hunter are limiting his minutes / dev - he’s starting games and defending all-star level players every other night.

It does mean the Hawks aren’t reliant on Rissacher during clutch minutes - so he has missed a lot of those types of situations, but because it’s a winning team he still gets to experience what a good culture looks like from the bench.

If he was making 5% higher rate from 3, he’d be grabbing an extra 5-7 mpg, once his shot starts falling - he will clearly be the best player out of the class from his fundamentals and awareness || As a hawks fan who’s watched every game yeah I don’t see star potential but I do think he can possibly make an all star team or two just off being an elite role player || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || Blocking shots isn’t the end all be all of defense || He will also grab an extra 5-7 mpg if Hunter or Bogi get injured, which happened earlier this season. With a full roster, his expectation should be around 20 mpg because they won’t close with him.  || It’s not at all but doesn’t change my mind that he’s not a good shot blocker.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.084,0.707,0.209,0.999,0.073,0.716,0.211,0.9998

B5: **LaMelo Ball** - Honestly I'm not too sure about this one, he's averaging thirty but he is typically made out of glass so I think it will depend on how many games he plays in the coming weeks.

B6: **Cade Cunningham** - Young budding star with great counting stats and who's impressive maturity has helped turn Detroit around immensely.

B7: **Darius Garland** Great player on a team that I think deserves to get three guys into the game.

**EASTERN SNUBS** (in no particular order)

Mikal Bridges, 
OG Anunoby,
Jarrett Allen,
Scottie Barnes,
Derrick White,
RJ Barrett,
Scottie Barnes,
Tyrese Maxey,
Josh Hart,
Jalen Johnson,
Bam Adebayo,
Tyler Herro,
Tyrese Haliburton,
Pascal Siakam,
Jimmy Butler,
Brandon Miller,
Joel Embiid (Injured)
Paolo Banchero (Injured)
Franz Wagner (Injured)

I'd probably put Tyrese Maxey, Derrick White, RJ Barrett, Jarrett Allen, Jalen Johnson and Tyler Herro first up for injury reserves.

**WEST:**

G: **Shai-Gilgeous Alexander** - On here for obvious reasons

G: **Luka Doncic** - See above

F: **LeBron James** - Ah, this is a tricky one. Obviously fucking LeBron James will be an all-star game starter. And is he an all-star caliber player? Yes. Does every all-star caliber player get to be in the all-star game in the year 2024? No. Does LeBron objectively deserve to be an all-star starter this year? Probably not.

F: **Victor Wembanyama** - Everyone knew it was only a matter of time before this guy was at the very top of the league in terms of production, and here we are.

F: **Nikola Jokic** - An absurd basketball player

B1: **Anthony Davis** - The Lakers have a lot of problems, and Anthony Davis is only one of them sometimes. One of the biggest names in the league, he will be in the All-Star game.

B2: **Anthony Edwards** - Edwards has had a... weird season thus far. He has all but abandoned his athletic interior game to chick up threes on ridiculous efficiency. But is that what the Wolves need from him? Probably not. He will also be in the All-Star game.

B3: **Jaren Jackson Jr** - The Memphis Grizzlies are second in the West, so naturally I hear nothing about them ever. I was surprised to see that Jackson Jr. is their leading scorer. Maybe a Memphis fan can explain their success despite Ja and Bane having down years statistically. (Especially Bane, wtf is happening there?)

B4: **Kevin Durant** - Kevin Durant will be in the NBA All-Star game

B5: **Stephen Curry** - I honestly don't believe Curry deserves a spot this year, but see my entries for KD and Bron for an explanation.

B6: **Alperen Sengun** - Sengun is probably having a worse individual year than last year when at time she was heralded as the second coming of Jokic, but the Rockets have shot right to the top of the West this year and need a guy in the big game. I figure it should be Sengun, but again I literally never hear anything about the Rockets outside of Reddit and am not totally sure who their main guy is considering it seems that they have pretty consistent production across the roster and their top scorer Jalen Green is still the proto-type of AAU ball.

B7: **Kyrie Irving** - The last spot in the West was a tough decision. I gave it to Kyrie because he is having a great year, the Mavs are near the top of the West, he's coming off of a high publicity playoff run, and he is a known commodity in the league.

**WESTERN SNUBS** (in no particular order)

Norman Powell,
James Harden,
Jalen Williams,
Devin Booker,
Ja Morant,
De'Aaron Fox,
Domantas Sabonis,
Jalen Green,
Trey Murphy III,
Dejounte Murray,
Rudy Gobert,
Julius Randle,
Brandon Ingram,
Chet Holmgren (Injured)
Zion Williamson (Injured)

I'd probably put Jalen Williams, James Harden, Devin Booker, Ja Morant and De'Aaron Fox up first for injury reserves. Frankly I would put any of these guys in over Curry but I know that's not going to happen.

If you read this far congratulations. This has been a nice way to spend an hour. Let me know what your thoughts are.",96,60,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hogf1q/mock_early_allstar_rosters/,2024-12-28 16:57:33,"I'm really nibbling at the edges here, but snubs implies that they're having a great season and maybe only barely miss out on a spot. It doesn't mean a known good player who's scoring 20 a game or some prior All-Star. Maybe they're honorable mentions or sub All-Stars (a concept from Thinking Basketball), but they're not snubs.


For instance, I find it difficult to believe that the Pelicans get 4 players in the snub category with the worst record in the West. Green, Randle, and Gobert (as much as I liked his contributions with us) are not snubs either. 


Similar for the East. || Anthony Edwards is shooting 3s this season because the starting line up has Gobert, McDaniels, and Randle who all do not give him spacing to play an interior game. || I really agree with these. It's hard to get new blood in the game with all the legacy/ large market picks but that's just part of it for now. 

As a Grizzlies fan, Bane had an oblique injury early in the season and he just now seems to be shaking the rust off. Combine that with playing fewer minutes by design with a deep bench and his numbers are down. I'm not concerned. || I can explain the Memphis situation. JJJ massively improved when he was the only one healthy last season playing with literal G league players as his starting teammates. Ja keeps getting hurt every three games so he has missed a lot and is trying to focus on assisting more. Bane got an injury early season and is just now getting back to form. He was pretty bad for a while though. The Grizzlies are doing so well because during the offseason they fired almost all of the assistant coaches and brought in a ton of new ones. The new offense is all about sharing the ball and playing with the fastest pace in the NBA. Most games even the starters play under 30min because the philosophy is to always have fresh guys in the game. So far the Grizzlies have the best bench in the league and that’s why they keep winning even though Ja and Bane haven’t been at their best. Also drafting two rookies who are top 5 helps. Oh yeah and GG and Vince still haven’t even played yet. (Vince played two games but I’m not counting that.) || If you think Curry doesn’t deserve an Allstar nod this year, I will agree on that. But Allstar game is in San Francisco, his home turf. Plus, he is like top 2 in terms of popularity so I think he will still be an Allstar even though he is regressing. || Jalen Williams has to be in there, OKC are miles ahead in the West and deserve at least 2 All-Stars (and if Chet wasn't injured you could even make a case for 3 All-stars) || I think your East is probably close to what it will be (some of it is easy to predict – the East starters are already pretty much locked up). However, I think it will Herro instead of LaMelo. Coaches reward winning with the reserves. Heat are sixth right now, Hornets thirteenth. Heat will have someone. Bam is having a down year and there’s no way coaches reward Jimmy for whatever is going on with him. And Herro has been great. He’s having a crazy efficient year and has been good enough to deserve it. || I think your east lineup is great. I think Herro might sneak in, but that’s it. 

In the west, I think Harden should be an absolute lock, but because of politics he might miss it. He’s better than Sengun and Kai. Imo Sabonis, Fox, and maybe Book and JDub have also been better than those two. || Harden deserves it. I don’t think Dallas should have 2 all stars. Luka might miss it depending on the severity of his injury. 

As for the East, I don’t think Cleveland will get 3 all stars. I think Hali or Maxey gets in instead of Garland. || Sengun inclusion by a non biased Rockets fan is great to see. His game isn’t as flashy because of the Udokas system, but he’s way more effective overall which has contributed to team success. || Nice breakdown…pretty darn accurate…definitely hope Melo plays the rest of the games till ASG…he’s a joy to watch, makes me chuckle how much fun he’s having 🕊 || Agree with all except for Kyrie, I think JDub and Harden deserve it more than he does rn given that the league normally awards the top teams two all stars like last year with KAT and Ant and that a surprising team like the Clips would normally have an all star especially one thats a house hold name. 

Though I do not hate the selection and understand your reasoning for that || Focused mostly on your East lineup as I’m a Sixers homer. 

Lamelo entertaining AF and has played 22 games, def would keep him in.

I take the all star as popularity / the current season. So don’t care that Brown was finals MVP or would be upset, he’s on outside of the fence for me 

Josh hart as a snub what? 

I’d get Maxey in the mix - otherwise generally like the work (once again, am homer) || LaMelo is not an All-Star!! His team is 7-24. This is the Bradley Beal 2020 situation. 30 PPG on a bottom feeder on bad efficiency is not All-Star worthy. Also noteworthy that Beal shot 45% from the field and LaMelo is shooting 42%. Empty stats. || I agree on all of the above. My heart tells me that Lebron and Durant should be swapped, but I know that is unlikely.

Doesn't mean I won't keep voting for Tyrese and Pascal but after the start we had... Siakam has an argument but it is unlikely. || I will be shocked if Sengun makes the all-star game

He should behind Jalen Williams, Harden, Fox definitely and then probably behind Nooker, Morant and Powell || I would take Trae over Brunson for the first five this year. He is doing great as a playmaker with that young players around him. || Definite agree on curry arguably not deserving it, might put KD over Vic in the starters just due to fan vote and bc he’s still been very good this year || [removed] || [removed] || I’m glad you asked caused I dropped a video 2 weeks ago, a few minor tweaks 

https://youtu.be/MyZcJWoxE_k || Nice list, what shocked me the most is that Jaren Jackson is the leading scorer not Ja Morant! || He won't make it because of the injury, but Cam Thomas at least deserves a mention. || Its pretty crazy how many people don’t realize all star reserves aren’t selected by fan vote || yeah i definitely was rough around the edges with the snubs. forgot to mention i had a low bar for that. to be fair i literally added those three guys right before i posted lol just as an add-on || i will also say that despite narratives and team success, check out randle's shooting splits when you get the chance. his scoring his slightly down but it's not like he some bum already. || Him “chucking up” threes is literally what the wolves need from him lol || What was wrong with the Grizzlies assistant coaches? || Spot on, but I think a lot of Ja's games missed to injury are precautionary this year. || that is what is frustrating about legacy guys eating up spots. you can assume every year that injury will call for replacements. also swap him and kyrie and you get no argument from me.",0.483,0.517,0.0,-0.4215,0.064,0.836,0.1,0.9911,0.095,0.708,0.197,0.9995

It's a deep dive into where New York currently stands as a team and what options it has to break out of its current rut.*

**I hope you enjoy it!**

The New York Knicks always [come packaged with guarded optimism](https://neilpaine.substack.com/p/its-ok-to-be-excited-about-the-knicks?utm_source=publication-search). The franchise hasn’t won an NBA title in more than a half-century, [finding ways](https://neilpaine.substack.com/p/nobody-has-the-knicks-number-like?utm_source=publication-search) to [mess it all up](https://www.si.com/nba/2022/01/13/john-starks-pat-riley-1994-nba-finals-game-7-daily-cover) whenever they get especially close, but there’s also a palpable sense of excitement in New York City whenever the Knicks are on the upswing.

However, as promising as this season seems, the factors fueling New York’s success could also be what makes the team vulnerable during playoff time.

**Is Too Much Continuity Bad?**

Let’s explain that a bit more. We mentioned that the Knicks have [one of the most effective starting lineups](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?StarterBench=Starters&dir=A&sort=NET_RATING) in the league, with a net rating that trails only those of the Thunder, Cavaliers, and Celtics. (Good company to be in!) However, New York relies on its starters more than other teams. According to [data from PBPStats.com](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/team?Season=2024-25,2023-24,2022-23,2021-22,2020-21,2019-20,2018-19,2017-18,2016-17,2015-16,2014-15,2013-14,2012-13,2011-12,2010-11,2009-10,2008-09,2007-08,2006-07,2005-06,2004-05,2003-04,2002-03,2001-02,2000-01&SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&StartType=All&GroupBy=Season&StarterState=5v5,5v4,5v3,5v2,5v1,5v0), coach Tom Thibodeau is using his starters — a group that [almost always includes](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2025_start.html) OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Towns — for 18.9 minutes per night. Not only does that lead all teams this season (Denver is second at 18.0), but it’s tracking to make New York the 22nd-most heavily reliant NBA team on starters since 2000-01: 

Even putting aside [Thibs’ long-running tendency](https://www.nba.com/news/minnesota-timberwovles-tom-thibodeau-not-fretting-over-starters-minutes-load) to max out minutes for his veteran starters, it makes sense for these Knicks to be so focused on keeping their best players on the court. New York’s core group of starters from above also happens to be synonymous with its Top 5 players by [Estimated RAPTOR Wins Above Replacement](https://neilpaine.substack.com/i/150270605/nba-estimated-raptor-leaderboard) this year, generating a combined total of 19.6 WAR — the most of any team’s Top 5 in the entire league, so far. (Boston is No. 2 with 19.1 WAR from its Top 5 players.) The Knicks’ core is playing a lot, and it’s paying a lot of dividends in the standings.

Furthermore, this Knicks starting lineup has a lot of depth to it in terms of contributions. While Brunson and KAT [are far and away the team leaders](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2025.html#advanced::18) in Usage Rate — carrying nearly 60 percent of team possessions together while on the court — the overall value provided by the Knicks’ Top 5 is quite balanced in a historical sense. Here’s a plot of every pre-2025 team since 2000-01 (plus the ‘25 Knicks) whose 5 best players produced at a pace of at least 40.0 WAR per 82 games, along with the WAR per 82 of their No. 1 player: 

With the lowest team-leading figure of any team in the sample, this year’s Knicks are tracking for the most spread-out value from Nos. 1-5 on their roster of any team with a dominant five-player core since 2000-01. It’s a testament to how suited each player is to their role, plus how well they’ve been able to execute them early this season.

And the power of a strong Top 5 for a title contender is undeniable. [One of the biggest differences](https://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/post/nba_postseason_change) between regular season and playoff basketball is that rotations shorten in the postseason, [downplaying the value of a deep bench](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1492103-debating-nba-depth-vs-star-power-for-playoff-success) and emphasizing the importance of a team’s star players. (How many times have we seen a team that accrues regular-season wins on superior depth — but little star power — [flame out in the postseason](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-raptors-bench-is-destroying-the-nba/)?) In that sense, the Knicks are playing playoff-style basketball earlier than anybody else, and proving that they can win with it.

But there are downsides to taking such an approach, too.

As part of their tendency to [roll with the same 5-man unit far more than any other team](https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/traditional?PerMode=Totals&dir=D&slug=traditional&sort=MIN) in the league, the Knicks have been spamming the NBA with one action above anything else: The Brunson and Towns Pick-and-Roll (PnR).

It’s a play they’re built for. New York is a slow-paced team who loves to grind things out in the halfcourt — they [rank 26th](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2025.html#advanced-team::13) in possessions per 48 minutes (96.9) and [second-slowest](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/team?Season=2024-25&SeasonType=Regular+Season&StartType=All&Type=Team&StatType=Totals&Table=Misc) in average seconds per possession (15.4). Brunson and KAT are the team’s best offensive players by far, and they’re two of the league’s foremost experts in the art of the PnR. So it should be no surprise that, according to Second Spectrum, the duo has run 545 PnR actions this season, the most of any combination in the NBA. They are running a whopping 31.9 PnRs per 100 possessions.

How effective has it been? The duo is producing at a clip of 1.081 points per direct action, which ranks eighth among the top 20 most-used PnR combos this year and in the 62th percentile of the NBA overall. The 62th percentile is nothing to scoff at; it’s a solid night out with the boys having [Maine Lunch IPA](https://mainebeercompany.com/beer/lunch)s and wings; it’s not a night you’ll never forget, but it’s quality.

However, dig deeper, and those sweet Maine Lunch IPAs start to look slightly more like PBRs. For one thing, the Brunson and Towns PnR has seen its points per direct action decrease in every month of the season:

With the benefit of more film and data, opposing teams have learned to run coverage schemes that force Towns into a spot where he is asked to be a playmaker rather than a play finisher, where he is best. 

Two solutions have emerged to slow down the Brunson/Towns PnR:

1. **Primary Matchups:**

At the beginning of the year, teams were guarding Towns with their five-man. This matchup put the two defenders guarding the PnR action in hell: Do you switch and leave your five on an island with Brunson? No thanks. Play drop coverage and hope you can get a late contest on a Towns pick-and-pop 3-pointer after stopping the ball? Pass.

Now, teams are putting their five-man on someone other than Towns and using a more switchable defender instead, someone they wouldn't mind switching onto Brunson. The move allows for a simple switch each time the screening action happens.

After these switches, Towns and New York aren’t hunting the subsequent matchups as post-ups for him, even though he’s been pretty efficient this season in the post, scoring at 1.208 points per direct action. Indeed, he’s only attempting about five post-ups per 100 possessions.

**2. Early Rotations from First Tag Man:**

Another change has been early rotations from the backside to Towns when teams blitz the ball out of Brunson’s hands.

This coverage turns Towns into a playmaker — not his forte — rather than a finisher. Towns averages about 0.77 dribbles per touch (40th percentile), even while scoring 1.210 points per direct touch (94th). He’s a natural-born scorer, but teams are forcing him to become a passer.

The predictability of the Knicks’ scheme has allowed teams to funnel the basketball to lower-yield actions such as Towns’ playmaking opportunities or Bridges/Hart threes, none of which are considered strengths for this offense.

# Can Anyone Help Brunson Initiate?

The problem is, there aren’t other options to initiate offense that allow the NYK to play from an advantage with their starting 5 (which, again, has played *seven times* as much [as any other lineup](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2025/lineups/#all_lineups_5-man_)) aside from Brunson. 

Getting the offense playing from an advantage is all about cracking the defensive shell, aka getting them in rotation. The best players in the world at this have a combination of two strengths that they use in tandem to create fear:

* **Shooting + Ballhandling:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving, Trae Young and James Harden.
* **Strength + Ballhandling:** Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Isaiah Hartenstein, and Domantas Sabonis.
* **Speed + Ballhandling:** Ja Morant and De’Aaron Fox.

The NYK have one player in the starting five that can fit this description: Brunson, and that’s it. This makes it incredibly difficult to take the load off of JB. Just look at how few of the other Knicks’ starters can even *attempt* off-the-dribble 3-pointers — a critical ability for initiators, whose job is to instill fear in defenses, forcing them to bring two players to the ball and get other defenders in rotation — much less turn them into efficient plays: 

The predictability of the Knicks’ scheme has allowed teams to funnel the basketball to lower-yield actions such as Towns’ playmaking opportunities or Bridges/Hart threes, none of which are considered strengths for this offense.

Thus, the Knicks have a [$200 million roster](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cash/_/year/2024/sort/cash_total) with no depth that plays its starters more than anyone else but only has one consistently dangerous initiator within that group. (Every other contender has two such players.)

So what should the Knicks do with their problem of overreliance on certain plays and players? Spread the wealth — but maybe not in the way you think.

The idea of letting someone on the New York roster other than Brunson initiate the offense seems silly, so suggesting anyone else as an offensive hub is like throwing sand through a screen door. 

*(Whispers… wouldn’t it be nice if they still had a* [*7-foot playmaking hub*](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harteis01.html) *for who could quickly transition the ball from one side to the other and run efficient dribble handoff, split, or PnR actions?)*

Anyway, Brunson currently leads the league in a plethora of categories related to “touches”: 

If you don’t get the point, it’s Brunson’s show; he’s the center of the wheel, and everyone else is just a spoke.

One idea to diversify New York’s offense might be for Bridges to run more PnR as the ballhandler. He’s currently running 6.9 PnR’s per 100 (40th percentile) and scores 1.008 points per direct action (68th percentile). 

Those numbers are acceptable, albeit on low volume. But these plays are rare enough that they probably don’t make it to the top of the scouting report. Teams play whatever their base coverages are for PnR defense. If the volume ticked up and this action became a more central focus on the scouting report, you would see a lot of “under” actions, daring Bridges to shoot behind the screen.

While Bridges has had a much higher Usage Rate at times than his current 19.4 percent mark — [he was, remarkably, a 30 percent Usage guy](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-mikal-bridges-went-from-supporting-player-to-star/) after being shipped to the Nets in 2022-23 — he didn’t exactly shine when he ran a higher volume as a PnR ballhandler. Over the past two seasons in Brooklyn, Bridges executed 1,950 PnR actions, ranking 59th in efficiency out of the top 79 PnR ballhandlers by volume during that period.

These aren’t exactly impressive numbers. As a primary ballhandler in the PnR, Bridges isn’t efficient; he’s limited as a playmaker and doesn’t score at a high or efficient enough clip.

# Does New York Have A Counter Punch?

However, switching up the PnR combination might still be on the right track. The key is to insert new screeners as two-man partners for Brunson, not take the ball out of JB’s hands. 

Hart and Bridges are naturally more creative and comfortable being playmakers in an advantageous situation than Towns. At the same time, Towns creates more gravity off the ball as a shooter than either Hart or Bridges. As a result, both the Brunson/Hart (No. 7 at 1.240 points/direct action) and Brunson/Bridges (No. 3 at 1.254) pick-and-roll combos rank among the league’s Top 10 most efficient PnR pairings this season, with a minimum of 100 total PnR plays.

Unlike Towns, Hart and Bridges are both natural-born playmakers. And once they set the screen, they are both creative cutters who see the open space within the defense and consistently exploit it to create a shot for themselves or a teammate.

The potency of these combinations lies in the matchups: Opposing teams have been using their five-man as the primary defender on Hart, not Towns, while the worst perimeter defender usually defends Bridges. Deploying Hart and/or Bridges as the screener takes away the opposing team’s option to switch the action: Leaving either a five-man or your worst perimeter defender on an island with JB is, as the kids would say, [BBQ Chicken](https://www.tiktok.com/@espn/video/7338931241259093294?lang=en).

This means extra communication is needed on defense, and any time players need to communicate, it opens the opportunity for panicked thinking. These slight miscommunications can put the defense a half-step behind — and in the NBA, a half-step behind versus a smart veteran team like New York will almost always result in a quality shot.

These aren’t exactly impressive numbers. As a primary ballhandler in the PnR, Bridges isn’t efficient; he’s limited as a playmaker and doesn’t score at a high or efficient enough clip.

Another side benefit would be to make the Knicks less dependent on just two players to handle the majority of the scoring and playmaking load. Because right now, the Brunson/KAT workload is historic: New York is tracking to be just the ninth team since 1977-78 with two players boasting a Usage Rate over 27 percent and no one else on the roster at 20 percent. 

This, in turn, might make the Knicks a more unpredictable team that is harder to scheme up in a seven-game playoff series — and can more readily beat good opponents. Currently, the Knicks rank third-to-last in the quality of their victories in terms of the average [Elo rating](https://neilpaine.substack.com/p/2024-25-nba-forecast?open=false#%C2%A7nba-elo-ratings-and-form-report) of the teams they’ve beaten; only the Sixers (1428) and Wizards (1437) have won against teams with a lower quality than the Knicks’ 1438 mark.

# Contender or Pretender?

All of this might sound like we’re down on the Knicks, or being unnecessarily harsh on a team that [has a legitimate chance](https://neilpaine.substack.com/i/150270605/nba-forecast) to win the title. But in many ways, New York’s problems would be the envy of other teams. They have a core with two high-scoring stars and a supporting cast of starters that can fit into multiple roles. Perhaps recognizing this, Thibodeau and the Knicks have leaned heavily on what came most naturally for that group right away. 

But winning in the NBA is about more than talent or even money plays; it’s also about who can adapt and then counter-adapt from there. The rest of the league is beginning to figure out what New York does best, and the regular season isn’t even halfway over yet. It’s what the Knicks do from here that will determine whether they have the adaptability to finally cash in on their championship potential — or if this will be just another season of promise that goes unfulfilled in the Big Apple.",449,54,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hyc7jr/the_knicks_are_riding_brunson_and_towns_but_are/,2025-01-10 14:10:14,"It's terrifying for Knicks fans, but I really think the season hinges largely on the health of Miles McBride and Mitchell Robinson just to alleviate the minutes load on Brunson and Towns. There is not an easy solution on the team with the over-reliance on Brunson and Towns. 

Certainly, changing up the PnR partners would help, but Brunson and Towns are still on the floor. They have no choice but to live with that two man game. Other champions have ridden two stars to titles. 

When it comes to contenders, you're always searching for a tiny margin to improve. A tiny silver lining to this season is that both Bridges and OG are capable of shooting better from 3 than they have so far this season. All things equal, if both were shooting their career average, Knicks would bump up 7th to 5th in ppg and 17th to 14th in 3PM. 

Where the Knicks have to improve to catch up to the Thunder, Cavs, and Celtics is on the defensive end specifically the turnover differential. The Knicks are the 7th worst team in the league in forcing turnovers. They're just not generating enough points off turnovers which would alleviate some of the usage off Towns and Brunson. Deuce is their best defender navigating over screens, and he's been injured. 

But I also believe the defensive cohesion between Bridges, OG, and Hart will come. All three of them have had far better defensive rating seasons in their career. It's hard to catch up to the lineup stability other contenders have had when Bridges and Towns are new to the team, and OG missed large portions of last season.

The minutes load remains the biggest problem. All five starters are playing over 34.6 mpg. SGA is averaging 34.7. On the Celtics, only Tatum and Brown are playing that many minutes. No one on the Cavs are playing more than 31.4. Closing out teams, getting easy wins, getting easy buckets... is the only path forward for the Knicks to catch up to the other contenders. || A substantial amount of charts, graphs, and film edits go into the deep dive.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || A lot of their issues lately have come from a general team cool-off from behind the arc. For a team that’s built around getting players like Bridges & OG open for spot up 3s, they have not been falling the same way they were early in the season. When they’re playing a bad team, the offense is still potent enough to win despite this, because they still have a very strong presence inside the arc as well (They won a game hitting only 3 3s a couple weeks ago). However vs good teams that they can’t simply overpower offensively, they need their 3 point shooters to be hitting.

I’m not sure if it’s due to the heavy minutes played, other team figuring them out, or just a random coldness from multiple players at once, but something is definitely off offensively right now. Historically, Thibs has made the right team decisions when it comes to figuring out how to get the best out of his guys, but he always takes his time making those decisions; nothing reactionary. I trust that he will figure out what’s best for the team by playoff time, but there will be lots of bumps on the way. || Brunson-Towns Spanish P&R with either OG or Mikal (depending on who brings the worse defender into the action) could also be worth looking at || Bridges is capable of being a second on ball option and definitely needs more on ball reps. Towns isnt a “facilitator” but the dude can pass and has pretty good vision. They definitely should be giving him more post ups as well. As for the league figuring out the Brunson/Towns PnR, really not a concern. At the end of the day you put two of the best offensive players in the league in an action together and they have to make plays. Thats how any NBA team works especially in the playoffs. || [removed] || As usual with Thibs, his teams will get more regular seasons wins than another coach with same team. And then in playoffs when rest of teams play starters more minutes one sees that that weren’t as good as their record. || Bridges is gonna want to be paid and that is gonna add to the Knicks salary cap woes but their bigger issue is that they have so few picks through 2031 because of the Six-Pick-Mik trade they’ll not be able to have the young talent on rookie cost controlled contracts that big spending teams need.

I can understand wanting to trade for a popular player who is friends with others on the team but that is a “vibes” trade. You don’t give up that amount of draft equity for a player that has never been an All-Star. At least Rudy Gobert is a defensive monster in the regular season.

KAT is gonna be a $60m per season player soon and he’s already had some injuries.

I think the Nets are gonna feast on those late Knicks picks in 2029 and 2031 (but 2027 and the swap in 2028 might be good too). || [removed] || I’m ride or die the whole way with my Knicks but I have to keep it real and admit my gut says we need another piece and if it’s this year it’ll need to come via trade. Don’t get me wrong I like the team but they need reliable defense with enough offense added to our bench in the form of idk who? Johnny Isaac + Goga or 1 of them feels like a good target. Jusuf Nurkic is perfect imo for what we need and he’s priced well and riding the bench because he’s in the dog house w FO for some in game scuffle the other day. Perfect for MsG bring that dog to us we can use some guys that wanna win ugly. We kind of went from all dawgs to all pretty boys over night so Leon needs to get to work and call in those chits || I think there will be more clarity as they face some tougher opponents in the coming weeks starting with Thunder matchup today. Until I see Mitchell Robinson return and play with this squad a little, I don't want to pin down their key issues just yet, there should be much more offensive and defensive options open up with him back.

That said, I do also wish to see Mikal and Mcbride get more ball handling duties even when Brunson is sharing the floor with him to create more options on offense || [removed] || The key with other teams riding two stars is that BOTH stars can be the center of the offense that initiates advantage opportunities for others; towns, for all his talent, can not do this side of the coin.

Towns average 0.7 dribbles per touch; this is a clear sign of a play finisher, not a guy you run the offense through.

\^\^ Which is okay! He's fantastic at what he does!

The problem is they blew the big trade package on a guy who also can't do this.. that's the bigger problem. If you deal five first-round picks, you've got to get something better than a role-player. || Good post for an outsider to read. Thank you! || As usual with Thibs, his teams will get more regular seasons wins than another coach with same team. And then in playoffs when rest of teams play starter more minutes one sees that that weren’t as good as their record. || OG is a good shooter. For him, open shots are a good thing and something that teams do not want to give up.

Bridges is not a good shooter; open shots for him are the shots that teams are trying to give up; they are willing to funnel the ball to him instead of giving looks to other NYK players.

Thibs is good at this, but his teams do not make much noise come PO time. They are historically run down and injured. Consider that NYK has such a limited number of serviceable players due to poor drafting/developing and selling the farm for Bridges, and it's not exactly a combo that gets you excited about the future. || It's possible - they've run this one quite a bit with Hart. I think it's because teams are okay with Bridges taking as many 3's as he wants. || https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NqHAC/1/

^^ Numbers on Bridges as a PnR ball handler during his time in BKN. It isn't good. 

Many people say they should use him as an on-ball player like BKN. However, he’s not good at it; otherwise, they would be running him that way. 

He can't run on ball actions because you can go under every time and dare him to shoot. Teams are 100% willing to live with that every time. 

Towns: he can pass, he’s capable. Just not his strength, and that's no knock-on him. He's one of the best-scoring Bigs in the game. || I know you're trolling, but that's okay.

It refers to the Brunson and Towns two-man game (singular).

We dig deep into how they've run this one action (545 times) more than any other combination in the league and how it has had diminishing returns each month of the season as teams have accumulated more film and data on how to guard it.

Anyway, I hope you read it if you're into this NBA stuff and bring something to the discussion. If not, no worries. || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || Lots of wins vs. under .500 teams and losses vs. over .500 teams.

The tape is getting worse and worse in terms of process. They are getting stale on offense. That is what my rut comment is about, not just the wins and losses. || We removed your comment for being low effort. || What assets are left that would bring back a difference-maker without unloading one of their starting 5?

I've seen a lot of Robinson talk on here. He's not bringing back a big-time asset on his own. Sorry. || I do not consider them a serious contender for the title, but that is what makes NBA basketball fun. People can have different opinions, and we get to see them play out on the court. 

I'm excited to see what they do tonight vs. OKC. 

OKC was one of the teams that went without having their five-guard Towns and a more switchable player.

I'm interested in seeing if they post Towns on switches or avoid the action altogether and use Hart as Brunson's main PnR partner with Towns' spacing. || Please do not attack the person, their post history, or your perceived notion of their existence as a proxy for disagreeing with their opinions. || Live by Brunson, die by Brunson. Knicks fans wouldn't have it any other way.

The downside of OG and Bridges being so duplicative is that they could have gotten another creator, but with Brunson and Towns on the roster, you need defenders.

No team wins the exact same way. Perhaps, the Knicks aren't real contenders, but I think a suffocating Thibs defensive team exist in them if Robinson and McBride are healthy... and if OG and Bridges remember why they got the contracts they did.

The current Knicks team needs to mimic 2003-04 Pistons if they want to find their own way to contending. In the regular season, they need a bench lineup that can finish off games. Mike James, Lindsey Hunter, Corliss Williamson, Mehmet Okur, Elden Campbell, and Darvin Ham could finish off games in the regular season. It led to the starting lineup being able to play 40+ mpg in the playoffs.

Rasheed had the finishing but not playmaking second star issue that is currently present in Towns. Chauncey was by far the primary ball handler and shot creator. Tayshaun and Ben Wallace were in their defensive roles. And while Rip was a midrange sniper off screens, he wasn't a volume shooter who stretch the floor. Their spacing was entirely from Chauncey and Rasheed.

The question ultimately is whether the Knicks can elevate their defense to an elite level to make up for their lack of offensive versatility. || They need the reps to build the chemistry needed to take down the Celtics. But the situation still screams 4-6 minutes less per game for all 5 starters. || What makes you say that OG is a good shooter and Bridges is not? They’ve both been pretty inconsistent week to week, and right now they are separated by just 1.5% from behind the arc. Just a week ago, Bridges’ season 3p% was higher than OG’s. Also, Bridges’ midrange scoring is far superior to OG’s in terms of volume, efficiency & self creation. || I haven't really seen people clamoring for a bunch of Bridges on ball stuff at all. That isn't his game. He's not Klay level bad with the ball in his hands but he's a movement shooter. Still, I don't think you can index that much on Bridges PnR ball handling numbers on a terrible team with poor PnR partners to argue against it. 

Teams have not been going under screens for Bridges for almost the entirety of his career. He's a guy who you would much rather play tight and force him to have to drive or play-make than give him open shots, which though he has struggled from three this year, that is assuredly just a blip. Very good shooters don't just lose that ability all of a sudden and it has been creeping back up as is.

I mean he's currently shooting 42% on wide open threes this season and was at 38% on open threes last year. That isn't someone you go under a screen on. 

Also passing is one of Towns' strengths as a big - notably so. While he's not Jokic or even a Sabonis, he is quite a good playmaker for his size who has good vision and a willingness to make some pretty challenging attempts and convert on them. His *decision making* isn't great, but his touch and ability as a passer has been a career-long strength. || Even as someone who liked this article and found it insightful, my first reaction to the headline was the same. I think I would have preferred something like ""The Knicks are riding Brunson and Towns, but opposing teams are starting to figure them out""

To me that gets at the best part of the piece, which is combining the statistical observation that the two man action is becoming less effective and it's due to the tape of how opponents are guarding them differently. 

That said, I know there's a certain degree to which it doesn't matter what the headline is and people will not read the article in good faith. There's also the alternative angle in which sometimes having something easily ""correctable"" will make people engage with it more. So who knows.

In terms of the basketball philosophy questions getting posed about whether it makes sense to do the same thing over and over, I think it's an interesting question without a clear answer. On the one hand, there's the Bruce Lee quote about 1 punch practiced a thousand times is better than 1 thousand punches practiced 1 time which has some truth to it. I think employing it and seeing teams counter it throughout the regular season will also benefit the Knicks in a certain way so they can work through counters and not get surprised by that in the post season. 

On the other hand I do feel like the Warriors for example always saved the Steph-Draymond pick and roll spamming for high leverage situations. That way there wasn't as much tape for opponents to watch on something they knew would be effective and that there was more variety in their attack throughout a game and season. So there are trade-offs in both directions. The Knicks have chosen a direction though and I appreciate that there's a clarity and alignment in their approach despite the inflexibility that I think helps maximize what they get out of this group.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.062,0.786,0.152,0.9997,0.07,0.76,0.17,0.9999

Technology is incredible... until it isn't.

Today, I was scheduled to stand in for Adam Mares and guest host the All-NBA podcast with Tim Legler. Although I’ve filled in on the show multiple times for Legs, I have never done one with him, so today would have been a real treat.

I logged on 15 minutes early, chatted with James (the producer) about the rundown, reviewed my Ad reads (my first ones ever), and ensured my notes were formatted correctly. Next, Legs logged in, and we exchanged pleasantries as James went through the final audio/visual preparations before going LIVE.

Then BOOM…

The next thing I knew, I was listening to a background recording on a Facetime call about a computer being held for ransom by hackers. It was surreal. Needless to say, the show was canceled.

The internet can be a fantastic place when used for good, but it can also be downright scary when it’s not.

We were slated to talk about some outstanding NBA actions from last night. Three big games in particular:

* CLE vs. OKC
* IND vs. DET
* HOU vs. SAC

I love to add my notes to the Low Man Help podcast for context, so I wanted to share my notes for these three games with LMH (sans the Tim Legler podcast portion).

Here are my raw notes from the three games mentioned above. I hope you enjoy it!

# CLE / OKC:

CLE—All over O glass early. So many second chances. But didn’t make OKC pay.

OKC—The pressure they put on the paint with multiple HIGH-level ball handlers is unique. They do a great job of owning the paint (getting touches on O and not allowing touches on D).

Offensive:

* 67.1% (3rd) of their possessions have a paint touch.
* 12.1 (1st) TOs committed per game.

Defense:

* 61.5% (2nd) of their possessions have a paint touch.
* 18.6 (1st) TOs forced per game.

CLE—PnR defense: Are you sure you want to switch anyone onto SGA?! Allen, Niang, and Garland!

CLE—Can't keep the ball out of the paint. Go zone… still can't keep the ball out of the paint. OKC generates lots of good drives -> kick actions for catch and shoot 3’s.

OKC —PRESSURE.

No word inculpates them more.

Both offensive and defensive. They put pressure on the rim and don't let you put pressure on the rim on D with their switches and early rotations.

CLE— Atkinson’s T: it does feel like there is a human element to small vs big with OKC and being able to get away with fouls. OKC pushes the limit here.

Thibs quote from the PHI game on Wednesday: “Always curious to see how the first contact is of the game is called. Play on or foul.”

OKC—Joe checks in, and boom, Ghost Screens…

The first IJ action is a Ghost -> Flare 3. It's such a challenging action to guard. It's almost impossible to triple-switch between SGA on the ball.

CLE—Got to be able to play through Mobley at the 5 when teams are small. Especially these OKC groups. It's disappointing not to see them put him in switch -> post situations.

CLE—I don't understand the defensive coverages they are running. Why do teams chase SGA over screens at 40 feet?

OKC—f teams blitz SGA; OKC has some nice options in the pocket:

* Wallace -> Dort Three
* AC Dunk.

# HOU/SAC:

SAC— Monk as a starter, 19/4.1/6.7 (12 wins and 8 losses)

6.7 Assists and 2.4 TO per game as a starter.

His playmaking is popping; he is such a creative player, and that’s a big-time element of two-man; you’ve got to know how to make good lemonade out of ripe or rotten lemons.

HOU—Started with Sengun on Murray (protect from getting fouls on Saboins?).

It's a tough matchup for him to close out to a big-time shooter like that. Murray took advantage early.

\^\^ What does he do in the PO?

HOU - Taylor Rooks report: “The goal is to keep this team together through the trade deadline.” Rafel Stone

\^\^ Do you believe him?!

HOU—Is Aaron Holiday that much better than Reed Sheppard? If so, that’s a pretty big problem.

SAC—Monk and Sabonis are such a potent two-man game.

Monk has some two-man game, PHUNK!!

Filtered for Top 50 volume - PPD Ranks:

Monk as Ball Handler:

* PnR: 1st - 1.198
* Handoff: 5th - 1.160

Sabonis + Monk combo:

* PnR: 3rd - 1.235
* Handoff: 5th - 1.131

HOU—Enjoying the growth in simplicity within Jalen Green’s game. It used to be a long string of hunting loud highlight plays. Now, lots of good reads and hitting singles.

Sometimes, this becomes easier for guys once they have the money; mentally, it can unburden them and let them play free.

HOU—Sengun, can he survive defensively in a PO setting? They try to hide him as much as possible now; what happens when teams start hunting?

HOU—Thompson's game has such a Jekyll and Hyde nature.

* Transition/broken play? Sign me up.
* Screener -> advantage situation in the half-court? Yes, please.
* Offensive initiator vs. a set defense? No way!

Amen Thompson PnR/Handoff (Ball Handler vs Screener)

* PnR: 0.858 vs. 0.961

\^ 11 Points per 100 better.

* Handoff: 0.837 vs. 0.880

\^ 5 points per 100 better

Teams can play so far off when Amen is in the 1/2 court as an offensive initiator. Unless he learns how to shoot the ball. I’m unsure how you can have him be a primary ball-handler in the NBA.

Side note: The Thompson Twins are agents of CHAOS!!

SAC— DeMar can be challenging to defend in close games when he gets it going. Brooks has to be able to handle him one-on-one in the mid-post or switch Thompson onto him before sending the double, right?

It seems that DD and DC are somewhat in agreement about when to switch to mid-range ISO mode and when it’s Fox/Monk turn as offensive initiators.

\^\^ Everything is easier when you’re winning. We’ll see how long that lasts; it's something to keep tabs on.

# IND/DET:

IND—Nembhard, sign me up! How much stock can I buy?!

That's a guy who is ALWAYS going to be in winning teams. He knows how to play and has impeccable self-awareness about where he stands in any lineup.

Making Cade’s life hell from the jump, just throwing basketball body punches (making SLOB catches hard every time for Cade—the little things.)

Nembhard net rating per CLG is +15.7 (98th percentile).

Cade— 7-21 (1-7 3’s) and 7 TO

It shows! They are so much better with him on the floor.

DET—Without Ivey, they don't have enough secondary ball handling/ playmaking to relieve pressure on Cade.

IND—Pascal is teaching Holland II a lesson tonight. He is setting up every action, and Holland is a step behind; Pascal is getting whatever looks he wants.

\^ Holland—It’s a good lesson for the rook; it’ll help him improve.

IND—What a weapon Turner is from three (8-11) on the night.

\^\^ His PnPop game is one of the big reasons they are such a scary matchup for BOS in a PO setting.

DET—TOs were such a big part of the game that my dad used to tell our YMCA team club, ""The Most Shots Wins.” It’s so true.

\^\^ 19-9 TO in favor of IND. If you give it away that much more than your opponent, it will be hard to win.",121,8,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i3pzjl/the_tim_legler_podcast_that_never_was/,2025-01-17 15:32:16,"Sorry that happened to you, I love listening to Legler when I get the chance, and based on your notes I’m sure you would’ve been great with him. 

Just wondering what exactly happened? Was your call or broadcast hacked? 

Does this happen often, and do you know why it happened at all? || OKC is fucking scary man. I was at the game where they annihilated the Knicks and the way they switch and move reminds me of the Lebron Heat or that peak Warriors team when they made multiple Finals. That's the final step of a team's evolution for me, if you can get what you want on offense and take away everything your opponent wants to do on the other end. It's that ability to just have everything go well and win by 30 against even really good teams that sets them apart right now. And it doesn't feel like an accident either, OKC just took away every good look the Knicks thought they were getting by switching flawlessly and being longer and faster than you expect so there's just nothing easy the whole game. Part of that might actually be Hartenstein who is a crazy good help defender who you can't really exploit that easily for a guy his size. I know the Knicks never looked the same without him and now OKC is a top-tier defense too. I miss him. || thanks for posting the notes, this is a cool read. On your stock pick - Nembhard might be the most interesting trade candidate in the league now. If I were OKC or Houston, I'd might consider a mega-pick offer for him given the salary matching situation. || All good man, thanks. 

Yes, I was looking forward to this one!

Honestly, not sure, above my pay grade. No idea if it happens often, I've never heard of it. || Hartenstein is awesome and we love him, but he is not the engine that makes the OKC defense run. It's Lu Dort and Cason Wallace.  Best defensive perimeter duo in the NBA I'd wager. And Caruso giving either a rest has almost no drop off. 

JDub holds opponents to an effective field goal percentage similar to elite defensive bigs, even though he is frequently tasked to guard much taller and bigger players with all the Thunder center position injuries. 

Back when Chet was playing, it was him defending the rim too.

SGA is like a free safety in football. It's why he's so good at steals. He'll get some dpoy votes from people who don't watch all our games. His defensive advanced stats are awesome. Yes he's great at defense. But he's actually the guy other teams are targeting on D because the rest are so good. And they likely want SGA tired on the other end. SGA can only do what he does because the rest of the team is so elite on D. || I'm not quite as high on them as you but I can see why people really like them right now. || I'm glad you enjoyed them! I post my notes for every podcast on my substack:

https://open.substack.com/pub/lowmanhelp

Re AN trade: There is no chance IND lets him go. I know everyone has a price, but I just feel like he fills in all the gaps and enhances everything IND does. 

He also makes HALI much better because he takes so much of the mental ball-handling load off him.

I received a lot of positive feedback about posting my notes from the games I watched in preparation for my guest-hosting gig on the All-NBA podcast with Tim Legler. [Here are the notes from those games.](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/the-tim-legler-podcast-that-never)

I’m sharing notes from three games again but keeping one team the same: Minnesota.

Thanks for reading Low Man Help! 

* MIN vs. NYK
* MIN vs. CLE
* MIN vs. MEM

That’s three games in four nights, which is a good snapshot of the team. All three opponents are high-quality and present unique challenges.

MIN went 1-2 in these games. They are working through a new roster and could be a dangerous team in April. But, if they don't get it together, they could become wasted potential.

**Three macro things stood out to me on this three-game set:**

1. Rob Dillingham’s development.
2. Julius Randle’s playmaking opportunity.
3. Anthony Edward’s PnR reads—Process vs. Result mindset.

I was drawn to Dillingham during these three games, especially in the PnR. He’s a key piece in the MIN puzzle. They don’t have a lot of bites at the PD apple, and he’s a top-10 pick that they gave up a lot to get. His development matters a lot to their calculus.

**Dillingham’s PnR before the three-game stretch:**

* Per 100: 43 - He’s getting the film.
* PPD: 0.921 - He’s getting in the right spots; the process reads can improve.

**Dillingham’s PnR after the three-game stretch:**

* Per 100: 43.6
* PPD: 1.047 - He showed that his speed and creativity can present a unique element in this action.

Another big-picture takeaway was how vital Randle’s playmaking is for this team. JR and MIN should increasingly embrace it to be the best team they can be. I don’t know if he enjoys it more than scoring, but I believe it’s his elite skill and the one that MIN needs him to do the most.

Randle has the size and skill to create [cracked shells and rotations](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/the-blueprint-cracking-the-shell?r=2wmouo) against almost any defender he faces. Cover him with a guard, and he can bully in the post till you send a double. Cover him with a big, and he can get into the paint via dribble to draw a second defender. Put him in a two-man action with Edwards, and he gets to play advantage basketball from the pocket.

**Randle’s Playmaking Stats:**

4.5 Assist (Need more here as the season ticks on)

3.0 TOs

The optionality and playmaking of Randle & Dillingham are two of the most significant swing factors for this team.

Finally, the Rudy-Edwards dynamic is weird. Edwards does not like to give Rudy the ball in the pocket every time in blitzed two-man actions. I think Rudy needs as many reps as he can get in pocket playmaking situations, but even that feels weird to say out loud, given that Rudy is in his 12th year in the league.

\^\^ Edwards openly gets frustrated with Rudy during games. I am not sure that’s great for the situation—something to monitor.

# MIN/NYK:

MIN—Off the bat, OReb kicked out three. There is NO better time to shoot the ball. I think it’s because we grow up catching passes from a rebounder under the basket, so it’s the most natural motion. Who knows.

MIN—Randle + Edwards DHO game could be a game changer when teams go to blitz AE.

MIN only runs 3.9 per 100 and scores 1.095, but this action would be gold for them with Randle and Reid's ball-handling ability. It would also allow AE to set up backdoor cuts and play 3v2 downhill—scary.

Handoff Combo (pre-MEM game)

**Randle + Edwards:**

* Per 100: 3.9
* PPD: 1.095

**Reid + Edwards:**

* Per 100: 2.6
* PPD: 1.292

MIN—Not many players in the NBA are better at reading Drop coverage than Conley. The floater is such a weapon when “breaking” the big in the drop. Here’s a breakdown of MC “breaking” PnR bigs from last year's DEN series.

NYK—Brunson’s floater is up there with MC and he’s pretty good at “Breaking” bigs in the PnR. He’s such a fun watch. What a start for JB here, where would NYK be without him?

NYK—Bridges driving closeouts looks good, back to back catch & shoot threes generated. NYK needs more shot creation for from guys not named JB.

* OG misses corner drift WIMS read on first drive, turns into a ATB three instead of corner one.
* JB makes an awesome 2nd window WIMS reads for a catch & shoot three.

MIN—Good creativity and read from Dillingham in first PnR with Reid - got to use the left hand on the left side. Guys are too athletic in this league, can’t give that angle back.

MIN—AE step back 3… If Rudy is under the rim, has a cross-match, and you can see both of his numbers, you must give him a touch. Got to have some EQ there.

MIN—Dillingham’s speed is an outlier. Opened up a Reid 3 PM in a PnR action and then a lob to Rudy on an empty corner PnR. He looks like he’s got a chance to be a guy that can blow a game open every few nights.

MIN—The other side of the floor is a more significant learning curve for Dillingham. Back to back threes from Payne during his PnR coverage. I know it’s a drop with Rudy, but I would love to see how he evolves with getting skinny or not dying as much on the screen.

\^ Just gambled for a steal on a switch and gave up another Payne 3. No bueno.

NYK—CAM PAYNE is making it RAIN!! He just broke off a play to get a SB3 up, lol. I can’t fault him for wanting the heat check there, but Hart didn’t like it.

MIN—Dillingham gets a TO on a lob to Rudy by not making Sims “break” his 2v1 coverage in the drop. I’m excited to see where RD is at by the end of the year in reading 2v1 actions in PnR Drop coverage.

Three Dillingham PnRs from 1st half: Missed lefty opp and one good “breaking” read + one poor “breaking” read — I’m willing to bet he figures the NBA PnR out with reps.

NYK—Bridges & Hart’s defenders sitting slightly deeper in the gaps—court compressed. Without JB on the court, it’s difficult for them to generate good stuff consistently. Maybe it’s just this stretch.

**Bridges & Hart without JB According to CLG:**

* \+15.2 with Towns (507 poss)
* \+16.5 without towns (102 poss)

MIN—Reid feels like a cheat code. Man, that guy is talented offensively.

\^ How long will he be amenable to coming off the bench?

NYK—They refuse to switch JB onto a good guard in PnR actions. AE just burned them two plays in a row for 5 points. AE gets the switch right before the half and goes drag → SB3 on JB.

NYK—Bridges keeps shooting. I respect the hell out of that guy. The worst thing is going 0-1 while turning down nine open looks. I love that he’s willing to go 0-10.

MIN—There are just a few missed single reads from AE every game that feel forced. He’s so talented that he thinks he can score in any situation (he might be able to). But there are times when hitting a single would do wonders for him/MIN; this is one of them. Open corner 3 or swing swing to MC 3 if JB makes the help the helper closeout.

NYK—1st poss of the 2nd half JB off-ball screen action. NYK has to find ways (like this) to get him time off the ball to attack from an advantage. It's too much of a load to handle and score as much as they need him to—similar to Cade in DET without Ivey.

MIN—AE -> Rudy in the pocket | Rudy -> McDaniels in the corner | McDaniels advantage attack to a middy. You have to get Rudy these reps in the pocket now; they'll need to be able to play this card in May.

MIN—AE and JR have with two TOs on backside defenders stealing passes in the span of five possessions. Too casual.

NYK—What will they do when they get to the PO, and all teams do is spam JB’s man as the screener in every PnR action? It looks exhausting trying to keep him from switching.

AE had his way in these actions throughout the game. NYK gave up a Beasley 3 to lose vs. DET on a PnR where they didn’t want to switch JB onto Cade.

NYK—Must play fast without JB on the floor. Hart is easily a top 5 transition player in the NBA. He's so creative in the open court.

MIN—AE “breaking” Sims for a PnR lob to Rudy, I love that! AE can be the best player in the world if he falls in love with the process of hitting singles. The talent is otherworldly; he would grind teams down.

# MIN/CLE:

MIN—First play… geez. AE gives up layup to DM going UNDER a DHO. If you go under the action, you can NOT give up a straight-line drive at the rim. Bad tone setter here from AE.

MIN—Help UP the lane dunk for Rudy on an MC advantage drive. I imagine this is what they looked like when MC got traded to MIN.

CLE—Garland is so good at reading whether Rudy is “breaking” in the 2v1 Drop. I could watch him play PnR basketball all day. He’s the best teaching tape out there for young guards. I would 100% use it for Rob Dillingham. They are both undersized and have to be crisp and creative with the reads.

MIN—JR’s shooting is a significant swing factor for this team. It feels like he is turning down a lot of looks that Towns feasted off in two-man games with AE and MC. He’s had one outlier season as a shooter; otherwise, it’s low 30s.

\^\^ My eyes say the shot is not linked together and I would not bet on him shooting 40% on volume again with these current form.

MIN—Great LMH AE read and swing swing 3. This is the NYK play before halftime from last night. This is one of those singles that have to be hit every time and live with the results because it’s great process.

AE has made three of these early LMH reads → Corner passes this game. It’s nice to see him do the simple. Each one has resulted in a GREAT shot for MIN.

CLE—There is such a big difference in the quality of three-point looks they’re getting up tonight compared to the OKC game. Their dribble penetration looks so much better. OKC is so good at keeping the ball out of the paint.

MIN—FINALLY they get the ball to the middle of the zone (Reid) after five empty trips, and no one gets into the soft spot. The zone is giving MIN fits a good change-up pitch from KA.

MIN—How talented is Reid?! Off the bounce 3, soft spot of the zone euro floater, and running two-man game into a help up the lane lob to Rudy. All in the span of a few minutes.

MIN—NAW, great story of self-awareness. There was a real chance he was going to end up out of the league after NOP. His shift from “I can be the man” to “How can I amplify the man” will make him generational wealth. So awesome to see.

MIN—AE DHO with JR into an early LMH read and wide open Reid 3…. I love the process here. More singles like this from AE is a big deal, make or miss.

MIN—McDaniels & Randle do not give me much confidence as a shooter. Their kinetic linking isn’t good. It opens the door for mental blocks when they hit a stretch of the misses.

MIN—Rudy in the pocket → Help UP the lane → McDaniels in the dunker. Keep getting Rudy the reps!!

CLE—Graland and Mitchell are cooking this Drop coverage. What a two-headed monster those guys are in the backcourt. Play too deep, three ball. Get up to the level; pocket pass to 3v2. Help too much with LMH, skip pass for 3. These dudes are lights out against Drop.

**Garland & Mitchell vs. MIN:**

* 40 Direct PnR
* 60 Points

\^\^ Rudy’s DROP Coverage in PO—I feel like MIN matches up well with OKC and poorly with DAL because of this specific coverage. Luka can shred this coverage shooting from deep. SGA can cook it, too, but he won’t break you from the three-point line like Luka can.

MIN—I love it when Randle does the dirty work; he is all over the O glass. He’s so strong and can create chaos when physically engaged at a high level.

MIN—I do not understand how MIN forgets to get the ball to the soft spot in the center of the zone. Every time they get a touch there, it turns into good looks, but they forget and let CLE off the hook by passing around the perimeter multiple times in a row.

**MIN vs. CLE Zone:**

* 20 Poss
* 16.6 Avg. Poss Length
* 0.700 PPP

MIN—Dillingham PnRs in 4th. At his size, he’s got to be so crisp in the process and relentless in attacking.

* Allen in a switch and gives it up, no bueno. Keep it or boomerang here; get some penetration. SGA was merciless on these switches a few nights ago.
* Jerome UNDER on the next one and keeps going (he shot this one vs NYK).

CLE—Hunting Dillingham with Garland or Mitchell to salt this game away. These are good reps for RD but he’s got to figure out how he can put more resistance on guys at his size.

# MIN/MEM:

MIN—First play… geez. AE dies on a screen and gives up a WIDE OPEN Bane three. gap it or lock and get on the back hip and L&T. I know it's much easier to say, but back-to-back games with bad tone-setters from AE.

MIN—Randle Handoff game opening up things for AE. I really like where this action could go; so much optionality, and if blitzed, then Randle 4v3 is the best option for MIN.

MEM—Morant, man that dude is special finishing around the rim. Lefty one-hand pickup, wow!

MIN—Another backside TO to JR, this time from MC. All of them are in the 20ft area. I wonder if it’s a spacing thing with the bodies covering up where help defenders are located. Out at the 3-point line, you would see the backside defender; in the post, they wouldn’t be low enough.

MEM—It's not Morant-only, but the rip-through foul grifting is out of control again. Ty Jerome, Brunson, Morant, and Edwards. I’ve seen so much rip-through grifting over the past three games.

MIN—JR is creating a lot of good offensive looks as a playmaker. He can generate quality actions when he’s in the open-court playmaking.

MIN—AE PnR Single Reads. 2nd Half THREAD.

He’s one of the best players on earth. I really think he can be the best player in any series if he leans into hitting singles and trusting teammates more. He does it sometimes, and I believe consistently doing it would begin to empower his teammates and elevate them/him. Teammates feel when the best player trusts/believes in them (Jokic does this), and it helps; god, does it help them become more.

**Process vs. Results:** Too many times it feels like AE is swayed by the results of the previous play. AE has another leap in his game (scary) and it will come when he is no longer controlled by the results and falls in love with the process.

* PnR 1 (Level → Blitz/Switch) Opportunity to get JR in a 2v1 playmaking opportunity. AE takes a forced shot off a spin move.
* PnR 2: (Level → Blitz) Finds Rudy in the pocket early enough that Rudy can get his head around and read LMH. MIN gets WIDE OPEN 3 from Advantage Basketball created by AE.
* PnR 3: (Level → Blitz) Finds Rudy in the pocket again; the screen is lower, and space is tighter for Rudy. Rudy reads LMH and sees help UP the lane but makes too hot of a pass to handle for NAW.
* PnR 4: (Level → Blitz) Doesn’t hit Rudy in Pocket. He gets the corner on JJJ and forces the action. AE gets a foul, but it’s a bad process, and it’s a 50/50 foul. These are the plays where the previous result (not process) shapes AE’s process.
* PnR 5: (Level → Blitz/Switch) Gets the corner on SA and creates a cracked shell. AE can make this type of difficult finish, but there is a wide-open catch & shoot 3 from a really good shooter whose man has switched onto him. I believe he sees Wells here, so he knows it’s not a Veer switch.
* PnR 6: (Level → Blitz) Finds JR in the pocket early, and it leads to an open catch & shoot 3 for a really good shooter. Love the process here and trusting teammates at the end of a game. JR can thrive as a 4v3 playmaker in this type of two-man setting with AE when teams blitz.

PnR 4 & 5 are the ones where his results drive the process. I think his game makes the leap when he falls in love with the process and empowering his teammates.

*Side note—No AE bounce passes to Rudy. It is much harder for bigs to catch a non-bounce pass and then make good pocket decisions. MC gets Rudy bounce passes in the pocket more frequently, which helps his playmaking.*

MIN—AE off-ball actions in this game seem to be greater than the previous two; I really like that. Makes the on-ball action scary at the end of the game because you don’t have as much of a rhythm seeing it.

MIN—Dillingham PnR reads keep getting better. I really think the reps are helping so much and you can feel his teammates empowering him to take them. Feels like his teammates understand how much chaos his speed can cause.

* Pull up 3 vs. Drop—Love it! At his size, he’s got to be a process monster and be able to hit every shot in the book in the PnR. I think he has the talent to do it, the shot needs to be linked together a bit more to be a consistent shooter from above the break.
* Back to back plays where the nail help just stunts at RD. The first time he gives it up, and the second time, he keeps and gets a layup. Really like to see him learning on the fly.

\^\^ Big RD stretch in the 4th.

MEM—Morant is special going downhill. The fact that you can still go UNDER on any PnR actions with him and live with the results makes me feel like he can’t take the step of consistently being the best player in a series during the PO.

MIN—AE and NR gave up 4 points in the second half saving the ball underneath their basket. Little things like that kill you in close games.

MIN—JR is the guy who has to play make in the pocket when AE gets blitzed at the end of games. Created two WIDE open threes. Randle, in ”playmaker” mode, takes this team to another level.",38,12,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i6jo8a/minnesota_game_notes_from_mlk_weekend/,2025-01-21 09:23:33,"These notes are accompanied by a substantial number of film edits.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || Great read, thanks!

Love seeing NAW get a shoutout. He’s come so far last 3-4 years. Keeps adding to his game. I thought this particular 3 game stretch was one of his weaker ones of the year, which isn’t a knock, he’s been incredibly consistent. Can’t wait to see if he translates in the playoffs this year, last year was too big of a stage but his confidence & bag keeps growing.

Thoughts on starting Naz over Julius?  Naz allows Rudy to be much more of a rover (Rudy is just average as a man defender IMO). Randle has had a nice season and is great when things are going well and he looks pass first but when he ducks his head its game over for the offense, see both memphis games for examples of top of my head.  Feel like Naz’s instant decision making leads to better offense vs Julius’s slow slow slow ball stopping.  Though Julius can be nice when hes passing (ie Cavs game).

Really really excited for Dillingam’s growth. He needs time to mature but the stage isnt too big for him.  They might have a pretty good offensive player here. || The Wolves are okay, they'll probably perform better in the playoffs just because Ant is a demon there and for whatever reason he just makes like 45% of his midrange shots. But they still arent a good team or particularly well constructed.

Dillingham is insane. || Great job.  Going to cross post this in in r/timberwolves.

Minnesota prefers dribble drive paint touches vs. passing to person in the paint.  So their main actions don't typically apply well to get to the soft spot of the zone.It is a point of frustration with me as well. || A lot to unpack here. First off, you're welcome. Thanks for reading it.

NAW, I love it when players figure out who they are in the league and how they can fit in. Every one of these guys has always been the best player on any team they’ve played on before making it to the NBA; having the self-awareness to know and accept that this has changed is a hard step for a player to grasp. So my hat goes off to him for that.

NAW in the PO. I hope it goes well for him (a big bag is coming if so). It will be all about simplification of his game. Take open threes, drive closeouts if run off the line, and make good decisions on early help = pass or not enough help = finish. Basketball is simple, but that doesn't mean it's easy to do at this speed.

Reid vs. Randle. I don't know. I love NR, but JR has the playmaking that this team desperately needs in a PnR partnership with AE to be a high-level team. They both will play a lot in a PO setting, so not so much of a big deal here, but they do have to figure out if NR is the long-term starter. 

Dillingham is a big swing piece. He's talented, that's for sure. I bet TC sees some miniature Will Barton in him. I think getting him the reps now in the PnR is critical (it feels like they are) because his speed can create chaos and make life easier for many other guys. Especially AE when it comes to always having to generate defensive rotation.

  
I hope that covers it all. Thanks for reading, and looking forward to seeing how this team develops in the 2nd half of the season. || Better in the playoffs, yes, AE has shown to be great in that type of setting.

I know it doesn’t look pleasant now, but I think they have a chance to be special in the PO. Some tweaks have to be made, but I think there is a great team inside of the parts they have. || Thanks! I posted it in their sub (I'm not usually in there, so it might get taken down).

The zone stuff is very elementary. That should never happen with an NBA consistently in one single game. || Whats been so jarring is that there is rarely ever a game in which Minny has played greater than the sum of their parts, they havent clicked as a unit at all. || I haven't watched every game, but this might be true, which can be a positive if you're inclined to look at their glass as half-full. 

They have higher gears to get to as a team over the second half of the year. Just got to find them. || There's been multiple little 3 game sections of the season where they've clicked and gone on a 3 game win streak with each win being by 20pts. 

They'll usually come out the gate in game 4 surrendering a 14-2 run in the opening minutes and just lose their mojo for the next 10 games or so. Usually go like 4-6 in those stretches with a few single possession loses.

It's a really weird season for them. They have the talent to make a deep playoff run but the sustained chemistry has just not been there. They'll either get really hot late and upset the 3 seed or fizzle out.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.088,0.771,0.142,0.9997,0.061,0.716,0.223,0.9995

I received a lot of positive feedback about posting my notes from the games I watched in preparation for my guest-hosting gig on the All-NBA podcast with Tim Legler. [Here are the notes from those games.](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/the-tim-legler-podcast-that-never)

I’m sharing notes from three games again but keeping one team the same: Minnesota.

Thanks for reading Low Man Help! 

* MIN vs. NYK
* MIN vs. CLE
* MIN vs. MEM

That’s three games in four nights, which is a good snapshot of the team. All three opponents are high-quality and present unique challenges.

MIN went 1-2 in these games. They are working through a new roster and could be a dangerous team in April. But, if they don't get it together, they could become wasted potential.

**Three macro things stood out to me on this three-game set:**

1. Rob Dillingham’s development.
2. Julius Randle’s playmaking opportunity.
3. Anthony Edward’s PnR reads—Process vs. Result mindset.

I was drawn to Dillingham during these three games, especially in the PnR. He’s a key piece in the MIN puzzle. They don’t have a lot of bites at the PD apple, and he’s a top-10 pick that they gave up a lot to get. His development matters a lot to their calculus.

**Dillingham’s PnR before the three-game stretch:**

* Per 100: 43 - He’s getting the film.
* PPD: 0.921 - He’s getting in the right spots; the process reads can improve.

**Dillingham’s PnR after the three-game stretch:**

* Per 100: 43.6
* PPD: 1.047 - He showed that his speed and creativity can present a unique element in this action.

Another big-picture takeaway was how vital Randle’s playmaking is for this team. JR and MIN should increasingly embrace it to be the best team they can be. I don’t know if he enjoys it more than scoring, but I believe it’s his elite skill and the one that MIN needs him to do the most.

Randle has the size and skill to create [cracked shells and rotations](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/the-blueprint-cracking-the-shell?r=2wmouo) against almost any defender he faces. Cover him with a guard, and he can bully in the post till you send a double. Cover him with a big, and he can get into the paint via dribble to draw a second defender. Put him in a two-man action with Edwards, and he gets to play advantage basketball from the pocket.

**Randle’s Playmaking Stats:**

4.5 Assist (Need more here as the season ticks on)

3.0 TOs

The optionality and playmaking of Randle & Dillingham are two of the most significant swing factors for this team.

Finally, the Rudy-Edwards dynamic is weird. Edwards does not like to give Rudy the ball in the pocket every time in blitzed two-man actions. I think Rudy needs as many reps as he can get in pocket playmaking situations, but even that feels weird to say out loud, given that Rudy is in his 12th year in the league.

\^\^ Edwards openly gets frustrated with Rudy during games. I am not sure that’s great for the situation—something to monitor.

# MIN/NYK:

MIN—Off the bat, OReb kicked out three. There is NO better time to shoot the ball. I think it’s because we grow up catching passes from a rebounder under the basket, so it’s the most natural motion. Who knows.

MIN—Randle + Edwards DHO game could be a game changer when teams go to blitz AE.

MIN only runs 3.9 per 100 and scores 1.095, but this action would be gold for them with Randle and Reid's ball-handling ability. It would also allow AE to set up backdoor cuts and play 3v2 downhill—scary.

Handoff Combo (pre-MEM game)

**Randle + Edwards:**

* Per 100: 3.9
* PPD: 1.095

**Reid + Edwards:**

* Per 100: 2.6
* PPD: 1.292

MIN—Not many players in the NBA are better at reading Drop coverage than Conley. The floater is such a weapon when “breaking” the big in the drop. Here’s a breakdown of MC “breaking” PnR bigs from last year's DEN series.

NYK—Brunson’s floater is up there with MC and he’s pretty good at “Breaking” bigs in the PnR. He’s such a fun watch. What a start for JB here, where would NYK be without him?

NYK—Bridges driving closeouts looks good, back to back catch & shoot threes generated. NYK needs more shot creation for from guys not named JB.

* OG misses corner drift WIMS read on first drive, turns into a ATB three instead of corner one.
* JB makes an awesome 2nd window WIMS reads for a catch & shoot three.

MIN—Good creativity and read from Dillingham in first PnR with Reid - got to use the left hand on the left side. Guys are too athletic in this league, can’t give that angle back.

MIN—AE step back 3… If Rudy is under the rim, has a cross-match, and you can see both of his numbers, you must give him a touch. Got to have some EQ there.

MIN—Dillingham’s speed is an outlier. Opened up a Reid 3 PM in a PnR action and then a lob to Rudy on an empty corner PnR. He looks like he’s got a chance to be a guy that can blow a game open every few nights.

MIN—The other side of the floor is a more significant learning curve for Dillingham. Back to back threes from Payne during his PnR coverage. I know it’s a drop with Rudy, but I would love to see how he evolves with getting skinny or not dying as much on the screen.

\^ Just gambled for a steal on a switch and gave up another Payne 3. No bueno.

NYK—CAM PAYNE is making it RAIN!! He just broke off a play to get a SB3 up, lol. I can’t fault him for wanting the heat check there, but Hart didn’t like it.

MIN—Dillingham gets a TO on a lob to Rudy by not making Sims “break” his 2v1 coverage in the drop. I’m excited to see where RD is at by the end of the year in reading 2v1 actions in PnR Drop coverage.

Three Dillingham PnRs from 1st half: Missed lefty opp and one good “breaking” read + one poor “breaking” read — I’m willing to bet he figures the NBA PnR out with reps.

NYK—Bridges & Hart’s defenders sitting slightly deeper in the gaps—court compressed. Without JB on the court, it’s difficult for them to generate good stuff consistently. Maybe it’s just this stretch.

**Bridges & Hart without JB According to CLG:**

* \+15.2 with Towns (507 poss)
* \+16.5 without towns (102 poss)

MIN—Reid feels like a cheat code. Man, that guy is talented offensively.

\^ How long will he be amenable to coming off the bench?

NYK—They refuse to switch JB onto a good guard in PnR actions. AE just burned them two plays in a row for 5 points. AE gets the switch right before the half and goes drag → SB3 on JB.

NYK—Bridges keeps shooting. I respect the hell out of that guy. The worst thing is going 0-1 while turning down nine open looks. I love that he’s willing to go 0-10.

MIN—There are just a few missed single reads from AE every game that feel forced. He’s so talented that he thinks he can score in any situation (he might be able to). But there are times when hitting a single would do wonders for him/MIN; this is one of them. Open corner 3 or swing swing to MC 3 if JB makes the help the helper closeout.

NYK—1st poss of the 2nd half JB off-ball screen action. NYK has to find ways (like this) to get him time off the ball to attack from an advantage. It's too much of a load to handle and score as much as they need him to—similar to Cade in DET without Ivey.

MIN—AE -> Rudy in the pocket | Rudy -> McDaniels in the corner | McDaniels advantage attack to a middy. You have to get Rudy these reps in the pocket now; they'll need to be able to play this card in May.

MIN—AE and JR have with two TOs on backside defenders stealing passes in the span of five possessions. Too casual.

NYK—What will they do when they get to the PO, and all teams do is spam JB’s man as the screener in every PnR action? It looks exhausting trying to keep him from switching.

AE had his way in these actions throughout the game. NYK gave up a Beasley 3 to lose vs. DET on a PnR where they didn’t want to switch JB onto Cade.

NYK—Must play fast without JB on the floor. Hart is easily a top 5 transition player in the NBA. He's so creative in the open court.

MIN—AE “breaking” Sims for a PnR lob to Rudy, I love that! AE can be the best player in the world if he falls in love with the process of hitting singles. The talent is otherworldly; he would grind teams down.

# MIN/CLE:

MIN—First play… geez. AE gives up layup to DM going UNDER a DHO. If you go under the action, you can NOT give up a straight-line drive at the rim. Bad tone setter here from AE.

CLE—Garland is so good at reading whether Rudy is “breaking” in the 2v1 Drop. I could watch him play PnR basketball all day. He’s the best teaching tape out there for young guards. I would 100% use it for Rob Dillingham. They are both undersized and have to be crisp and creative with the reads.

MIN—JR’s shooting is a significant swing factor for this team. It feels like he is turning down a lot of looks that Towns feasted off in two-man games with AE and MC. He’s had one outlier season as a shooter; otherwise, it’s low 30s.

\^\^ My eyes say the shot is not linked together and I would not bet on him shooting 40% on volume again with these current form.

MIN—Great LMH AE read and swing swing 3. This is the NYK play before halftime from last night. This is one of those singles that have to be hit every time and live with the results because it’s great process.

AE has made three of these early LMH reads → Corner passes this game. It’s nice to see him do the simple. Each one has resulted in a GREAT shot for MIN.

MIN—How talented is Reid?! Off the bounce 3, soft spot of the zone euro floater, and running two-man game into a help up the lane lob to Rudy. All in the span of a few minutes.

MIN—NAW, great story of self-awareness. There was a real chance he was going to end up out of the league after NOP. His shift from “I can be the man” to “How can I amplify the man” will make him generational wealth. So awesome to see.

MIN—AE DHO with JR into an early LMH read and wide open Reid 3…. I love the process here. More singles like this from AE is a big deal, make or miss.

MIN—McDaniels & Randle do not give me much confidence as a shooter. Their kinetic linking isn’t good. It opens the door for mental blocks when they hit a stretch of the misses.

MIN—Rudy in the pocket → Help UP the lane → McDaniels in the dunker. Keep getting Rudy the reps!!

CLE—Graland and Mitchell are cooking this Drop coverage. What a two-headed monster those guys are in the backcourt. Play too deep, three ball. Get up to the level; pocket pass to 3v2. Help too much with LMH, skip pass for 3. These dudes are lights out against Drop.

* Jerome UNDER on the next one and keeps going (he shot this one vs NYK).

CLE—Hunting Dillingham with Garland or Mitchell to salt this game away. These are good reps for RD but he’s got to figure out how he can put more resistance on guys at his size.

MIN—JR is creating a lot of good offensive looks as a playmaker. He can generate quality actions when he’s in the open-court playmaking.

MIN—AE PnR Single Reads. 2nd Half THREAD.

He’s one of the best players on earth. I really think he can be the best player in any series if he leans into hitting singles and trusting teammates more. He does it sometimes, and I believe consistently doing it would begin to empower his teammates and elevate them/him. Teammates feel when the best player trusts/believes in them (Jokic does this), and it helps; god, does it help them become more.

**Process vs. Results:** Too many times it feels like AE is swayed by the results of the previous play. AE has another leap in his game (scary) and it will come when he is no longer controlled by the results and falls in love with the process.

* PnR 1 (Level → Blitz/Switch) Opportunity to get JR in a 2v1 playmaking opportunity. AE takes a forced shot off a spin move.
* PnR 2: (Level → Blitz) Finds Rudy in the pocket early enough that Rudy can get his head around and read LMH. MIN gets WIDE OPEN 3 from Advantage Basketball created by AE.
* PnR 3: (Level → Blitz) Finds Rudy in the pocket again; the screen is lower, and space is tighter for Rudy. Rudy reads LMH and sees help UP the lane but makes too hot of a pass to handle for NAW.
* PnR 4: (Level → Blitz) Doesn’t hit Rudy in Pocket. He gets the corner on JJJ and forces the action. AE gets a foul, but it’s a bad process, and it’s a 50/50 foul. These are the plays where the previous result (not process) shapes AE’s process.
* PnR 5: (Level → Blitz/Switch) Gets the corner on SA and creates a cracked shell. AE can make this type of difficult finish, but there is a wide-open catch & shoot 3 from a really good shooter whose man has switched onto him. I believe he sees Wells here, so he knows it’s not a Veer switch.
* PnR 6: (Level → Blitz) Finds JR in the pocket early, and it leads to an open catch & shoot 3 for a really good shooter. Love the process here and trusting teammates at the end of a game. JR can thrive as a 4v3 playmaker in this type of two-man setting with AE when teams blitz.

PnR 4 & 5 are the ones where his results drive the process. I think his game makes the leap when he falls in love with the process and empowering his teammates.

*Side note—No AE bounce passes to Rudy. It is much harder for bigs to catch a non-bounce pass and then make good pocket decisions. MC gets Rudy bounce passes in the pocket more frequently, which helps his playmaking.*

MIN—AE off-ball actions in this game seem to be greater than the previous two; I really like that. Makes the on-ball action scary at the end of the game because you don’t have as much of a rhythm seeing it.

MIN—Dillingham PnR reads keep getting better. I really think the reps are helping so much and you can feel his teammates empowering him to take them. Feels like his teammates understand how much chaos his speed can cause.

* Pull up 3 vs. Drop—Love it! At his size, he’s got to be a process monster and be able to hit every shot in the book in the PnR. I think he has the talent to do it, the shot needs to be linked together a bit more to be a consistent shooter from above the break.
* Back to back plays where the nail help just stunts at RD. The first time he gives it up, and the second time, he keeps and gets a layup. Really like to see him learning on the fly.

\^\^ Big RD stretch in the 4th.

MEM—Morant is special going downhill. The fact that you can still go UNDER on any PnR actions with him and live with the results makes me feel like he can’t take the step of consistently being the best player in a series during the PO.

MIN—AE and NR gave up 4 points in the second half saving the ball underneath their basket. Little things like that kill you in close games.

MIN—JR is the guy who has to play make in the pocket when AE gets blitzed at the end of games. Created two WIDE open threes. Randle, in ”playmaker” mode, takes this team to another level.",36,12,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i6jo8a/minnesota_game_notes_from_mlk_weekend/,2025-01-21 09:23:33,"These notes are accompanied by a substantial number of film edits.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || Great read, thanks!

Love seeing NAW get a shoutout. He’s come so far last 3-4 years. Keeps adding to his game. I thought this particular 3 game stretch was one of his weaker ones of the year, which isn’t a knock, he’s been incredibly consistent. Can’t wait to see if he translates in the playoffs this year, last year was too big of a stage but his confidence & bag keeps growing.

Thoughts on starting Naz over Julius?  Naz allows Rudy to be much more of a rover (Rudy is just average as a man defender IMO). Randle has had a nice season and is great when things are going well and he looks pass first but when he ducks his head its game over for the offense, see both memphis games for examples of top of my head.  Feel like Naz’s instant decision making leads to better offense vs Julius’s slow slow slow ball stopping.  Though Julius can be nice when hes passing (ie Cavs game).

Really really excited for Dillingam’s growth. He needs time to mature but the stage isnt too big for him.  They might have a pretty good offensive player here. || The Wolves are okay, they'll probably perform better in the playoffs just because Ant is a demon there and for whatever reason he just makes like 45% of his midrange shots. But they still arent a good team or particularly well constructed.

Dillingham is insane. || Great job.  Going to cross post this in in r/timberwolves.

Minnesota prefers dribble drive paint touches vs. passing to person in the paint.  So their main actions don't typically apply well to get to the soft spot of the zone.It is a point of frustration with me as well. || A lot to unpack here. First off, you're welcome. Thanks for reading it.

NAW, I love it when players figure out who they are in the league and how they can fit in. Every one of these guys has always been the best player on any team they’ve played on before making it to the NBA; having the self-awareness to know and accept that this has changed is a hard step for a player to grasp. So my hat goes off to him for that.

NAW in the PO. I hope it goes well for him (a big bag is coming if so). It will be all about simplification of his game. Take open threes, drive closeouts if run off the line, and make good decisions on early help = pass or not enough help = finish. Basketball is simple, but that doesn't mean it's easy to do at this speed.

Reid vs. Randle. I don't know. I love NR, but JR has the playmaking that this team desperately needs in a PnR partnership with AE to be a high-level team. They both will play a lot in a PO setting, so not so much of a big deal here, but they do have to figure out if NR is the long-term starter. 

Dillingham is a big swing piece. He's talented, that's for sure. I bet TC sees some miniature Will Barton in him. I think getting him the reps now in the PnR is critical (it feels like they are) because his speed can create chaos and make life easier for many other guys. Especially AE when it comes to always having to generate defensive rotation.

  
I hope that covers it all. Thanks for reading, and looking forward to seeing how this team develops in the 2nd half of the season. || Better in the playoffs, yes, AE has shown to be great in that type of setting.

I know it doesn’t look pleasant now, but I think they have a chance to be special in the PO. Some tweaks have to be made, but I think there is a great team inside of the parts they have. || Thanks! I posted it in their sub (I'm not usually in there, so it might get taken down).

The zone stuff is very elementary. That should never happen with an NBA consistently in one single game. || Whats been so jarring is that there is rarely ever a game in which Minny has played greater than the sum of their parts, they havent clicked as a unit at all. || I haven't watched every game, but this might be true, which can be a positive if you're inclined to look at their glass as half-full. 

They have higher gears to get to as a team over the second half of the year. Just got to find them. || There's been multiple little 3 game sections of the season where they've clicked and gone on a 3 game win streak with each win being by 20pts. 

They'll usually come out the gate in game 4 surrendering a 14-2 run in the opening minutes and just lose their mojo for the next 10 games or so. Usually go like 4-6 in those stretches with a few single possession loses.

It's a really weird season for them. They have the talent to make a deep playoff run but the sustained chemistry has just not been there. They'll either get really hot late and upset the 3 seed or fizzle out.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.088,0.771,0.142,0.9997,0.061,0.716,0.223,0.9995
Jalen Brunson,"""Jalen Brunson"" OR ""Jalen"" OR ""Jalen Dime"" OR ""Brunson""",2025-01-25,nbadiscussion,1iauy90,Which players do you believe are playing at suboptimal body compositions? And potentially incorrect position.,"General realistic rules:

 +overall size = stronger but slower
Size can be either in the form of fat or muscle as long as it 'seems' realistic 

Elite athletes have mostly elite level genetics (and access to assistance)

However someone like Trae may never be big as Jrue but potentially could be like younger Curry size.

Eg.
Obviously Zion could be in shape. But what if he lost a LOT.
But what if someone like Ben Simmons just bulked and actually played Center.
Should someone like Onyeka Okongwu slim down to not go against Centers? 
Does Desmond Bane or Brunson need all that size year round?
Should some of those long athletic wings like Trey Murphy/Jaden McDaniels try to get the size of PG? Or would they be better we go larger like JJJ or Julius Randle? 

Some other ones which I don't think would be beneficial but interesting to watch would be like: what if KD actually tried to gain muscle? Or Luka got shredded?

On the opposite side, I think someone like Giannis is an example of fully maxed physical potential. 

Thoughts? ",64,56,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iauy90/which_players_do_you_believe_are_playing_at/,2025-01-26 19:23:31,"Sometimes you see guys be at their ideal composition then move away from it like tyrese maxey gaining a lot of muscle is still weaker than any non guard but now isn’t necessarily faster than all guards like he was before. He was a positive outlier before but instead he’s lost some of that advantage to still be at a disadvantage in strength. || Giannis is interesting because young Giannis was so fluid with a shot to match. His muscle growth was so fast and jarring that I think it was at the loss of a lot of fluidity. Think Dwight shooting free throws where he just tried to flick his wrists as soft as possible. I imagine it’s really hard for most players to find what works best because their role might not be the same every year. Anthony Davis has put on a lot of size to play the 5 position he has asked for almost a decade to avoid. Might be a whole different player if he had stayed slender and mobile like a KD. || Charles Barkley is classic example of this. Once he lost weight he was almost unstoppable || Keegan Murray is kinda interesting here. He bulked up to play the 4, where I feel like his natural position is the 3. He's now the best defender on the Kings, and is one of our better rebounders now, but his 3 pt percent has kinda dropped which might be due to the added muscle affecting his shot. 
His rookie year he was a 3 pt sniper but got bullied on the boards and on defense. Makes me wonder if he could have become a good defender without the added muscle since we still mostly have him guard on the perimeter, or maybe he'll start hitting his 3s at a higher rate with his added size || I have been suspicious the Bulls are playing Williams out of position at the 4 spot his whole career and he is really a small forward.

His footspeed isn't fantastic but his size and strength should help him stick with any quicker wings he may match up with defensively. On offense that same size and strength should help him post up or shoot over guys from beyond the arc.

He is a mystifying player to watch regress.

Trouble is the Bulls dont really have any starting power forwards on the roster, so Pat is kind of stuck at the 4 and the Bulls are stuck with him at the 4. || I always thought when you play a game like basketball it’s less than optimal to play with a lot of muscle as the game is centred around cardio and being able to carry out movements for a long amount of time. 

I don’t believe there is a correlation between aesthetics and performance. We often have a bias that athletes must look like bodybuilders to be optimal at their jobs. || Trae will always be undersized even compared to an undersized Curry: he is at least an inch shorter (probably 2) and has 2 inches less of wingspan. Getting more muscle wouldn’t solve this and Trae doesn’t seem to be the guy to enjoy physicality like Bane and Brunson, who are also undersized, but use their strength to bully taller and lankier defenders. If both Bane and Brunson wanted to play more finesse style of ball, maybe they could drop a bit of size, but they would need to become even more skilled than they already are.

Zion can’t lose A LOT of weight, that’s just his body type. That said, he could absolutely drop to heavy pre-Miami LBJ weight (250 or so pounds) and that would help his longevity tremendously while he would still maintain physical advantage over anybody in the league.

Simmons doesn’t have any Cs skills to play position full-time: he doesn’t provide much rim protection compared to players of his size and he has next to no footwork and barely any touch to score in the paint. He was at his best as a perimeter stopper capable of defending on switches 1-5 and has always been limited on offense, but if he was to gain weight, he would lose even more ability on defense (won’t keep up with guards at all) while still providing barely any value on offense.

Okongwu is almost the exact opposite: he basically has no skills outside the paint. Playing even PF without ability to drive (let alone without a decent shooting ability) is next to impossible in modern league, especially considering Okongwu is respectable defender on perimeter, but far from defensive stopper.

Trey and Jaden are probably better off as PG clones, but they could theoretically try to get to JJJ size. The thing is, size is not the only thing that matters: JJJ is an excellent inside defender and is a good inside scorer, so Trey and Jaden would need to develop those skills to be effective PFs. Considering where both players are (respectable 3-D players, Trey develops driving game) it’s just easier to catch up to PG in skills.

KD gaining muscle would have probably turned into Giannis: great inside scorer that would have most likely lost most of his outside shooting ability. Do we remember that Giannis shot career best 35% on 3s in his rookies season before starting to bulk up? KD probably wouldn’t be flirting with 40% career shooting on 3s with more muscle.

Luka is an interesting case: yes, he is not dunking or breaking down defenses with his speed like he did in his first 2-3 seasons, but he is overpowering any defender opponents throw at him with his sheer size. He is like a smaller but more skilled as a ball handler Jokic: there is no defender who can reliably stop either 1v1 due to combination of size, weight, vision and skill. I’m not sure shredded Luka would be a better player today: “fat” version can take on physicality and beating inside, though I’m sure less weight would have prolonged his career, similar to Zion. || Caleb Martin being a 6'5, 215 pound pf is suboptimal for sure. I don't think bane can afford to lose much weight if any, part of why he's such a good defender despite having a negative wingspan is that he's hard to bump off and create enough space to get a decent shot off. He loses weight and he'll end up like Tyler herro, able to stay in front of guys but can't contest very well when they bump him back || Looks like Jaylen got jacked this year and he looks stiffer and a little slower and his shooting not as good || Harden is in better shape this year, but he could still stand to be a little leaner I think.  Been that way a lot of his career.  Guess you can’t be that critical given how good he has been.  

Jonas Valanciunas.  His rookie year he was a lot skinnier and more mobile.  Raptors asked him to bulk and he lost a lot of that quickness.   He could probably stand to lose 40 or 50lbs and it would be night and day for him, IMO.  Maybe he loses a little bit of strength, but that wasn’t ever really a big problem even when he was thinner. || I love this question. KD would be very interesting to watch if he had developed into a PF/C instead by adding a tiny bit more muscle. Always wondered how he would play if he was an actual big instead. If he focused on skills near the rim in college, I think he would be an excellent rim protector combined with his shooting touch making him the first unicorn big. || Embiid. If Embiid played his entire career at 240-250 pounds, as the geat bigs of the 80's and 90's did, he'd of had a far more healthy career. Instead, despite putting up some historic scoring numbers, he's played his entire career 40+ lbs too heavy. As a result of that, his strength and conditioning have always been suboptimal. Embiid has never dedicated himself to getting in shape. || I don’t think Zion is operating an optimal body composition.

Bro is holding onto more McDonalds than I’ll eat in a lifetime. || Taking Draymond Green’s body on this one. Skillset doesn’t match his physical metrics. Backpack shot, he’s solid in the paint, but lacks height. Tweener height and a belly on him. He has a handle, while not great, is respectable enough to push the break. He had a better package of offensive go-to’s in college that dissipated when he started playing heavy minutes for the Warriors.

Then again, there are a bunch of pudgy boys who can ball. From the YMCA to the NBA. || [removed] || [removed] || I think about this with OG whenever I watch him play now. I’m sure he was hearing the “able to guard 1-5” conversations and wanted to bulk to be apart of them, but he’s lost a lot of agility and his game just seems way more laborious. They play different roles, but I’m a little worried Jaylen Brown is headed down a similar path || I think Zion Williamson shouldve been forced into more of an on ball role and forced to keep his weight under 270 (really 260).

Zion’s rebounding and rim protection are typically bad for a starting big, but he has really great playmaking, transition, and rim finishing. Let him loose in a transition based, one read, on ball role (think Russell Westbrook/Pre Injury Ben Simmons) and take advantage of teams need to collapse or get out the way when he has a full head of steam. I think Zion Williamson could be a superstar in this league, but from a team building perspective, a hyper athletic on ball player is much easier to build around than a 4 who doesnt have a great jumper or defensive fundamentals. || You also have to consider the immense mental differences in different positions. Of course the sport is moving very position-less but playing centre vs PG are two very different mindsets, let alone physical needs and skillsets || Luka needs to be much leaner- he would be talked about in the same breathe as prime Curry if he was in shape (not invterms of playstyle but impact) . Brunson's build actually suits his playstyle- him and Lowry have that shorter bulldog build that allows them to get to their spots. || I don’t know but I remember Curry bulking up a bit and temporarily losing some of his finishing touch and three point shooting in 2022. || AD is a 4 not a 5.... KD is a 3 not a 4 that's why he lies about his height.... Lakers are idiots for thinking AD can play the 5 still can't believe this is a thing || That’s true, but I’d imagine he’d gained some defensive upside, as well as maybe ability to just not get bullied running offball. 
Plus his role has kinda been a bit of a mess his whole career from playing behind Simmons/Toby, then Harden, Embiid, then 24/7 injuries in the team bounces him everywhere from sole creator to 3rd option to 1st option. 

But you’re right and I’m interested to see his growth. || De'Aaron Fox did something similar a few years ago, or at least that's what the reports said at the time. He put on a bunch of muscle for 21-22 and it hurt his speed. Came back lean and fast the next year and made all-nba. || It’s cause he gained fat, he probably dirty bulked. Once he cuts that fat off and gets shredded he’ll be back to prime Lebron || Hasn't exactly turned out badly for Giannis though.. || Davis is an interesting example I think you could argue either way. If he doesn’t put on the weight his outside shot is likely better, but still not what you want for a 4 in 2025. Conversely his size and position change has led to him developing his touch closer to the basket to a level he easily may not have gotten to

Based on younger ADs potential it’s hard not to assume he should’ve stayed thin, but I think it’s a bigger question mark than some might assume || I seemed to remember Giannis not being a shooting threat early in his career but I might be mistaken. I definitely don't remember a fluid jump shot... || I think Giannis's jump shot is mostly the result of bad coaching. Now that Doc is encouraging him to shoot he's shooting a lot better. || Completely agree, Keegan is in that Herb Jones, Trey Murphy kind of build when he is best suited as a pure wing instead of a 4. I honestly feel like he had to play 4 with arrival of Derozan, who is not a 2 anymore with his lack of burst, but honestly I’d rather Kings prioritised Murray’s development as his rookie season was extremely promising.",0.0,0.886,0.114,0.2023,0.014,0.764,0.222,0.9926,0.09,0.736,0.175,0.9997

Feat. 2X NBA COY Mike D'Antoni.,"I recently interviewed with 2X NBA COY Mike D'Antoni. We covered a whole gambit of topics, like the current style of play (volume of 3PA), international vs. domestic youth development, creating partnerships with players to allow for innovative basketball, and why the term ""role player"" is just awful!!

Over 100 NBA personnel subscribe to my substack (which I will not promote here), including half the league's GMs and several current and former head coaches (like D'Antoni). Getting elite-level basketball minds like Coach D'Antoni to discuss the game's current state and future direction has been fun.

Here are my notes from the pod (I post all my notes on my Substack). I will post the Substack link in the comments to the entire conversation with Mike D'Antoni in case anyone wants to check it out.

**Innovating Outside The Box:**

The true mark of a Mike D'Antoni-coached team was a unique, innovative, and ""uncommon"" style of play for the era.

His Phoenix “seven-second or less teams” have been the subject of books. When teams hesitated to compete against the Kevin Durant version of the Golden State Warriors, his Houston teams assembled the personnel and strategies to push them to the limit.

Houston’s 2018-19 and 2019-20 teams are the top two teams all-time in 3PA per game, not counting this season's teams.

**Coach D’Antoni’s 1st HOU Season:**

* (15-16) Pre-MD: 30.9 3PA
* (16-17) Post-MD: 40.3 3PA

That’s a significant *33% increase*; the closed team that season to HOU in terms of volume from the three-point line was CLE at 33.9 3PA, about 19% less.

This year's top 3PA team is BOS, at 49 3PA per game; right behind them is CHI, at 42.9 3PA, about 14% less.

Inside his innovative teams were multiple MVP runs of two players who changed how the point guard position is played. Their influence can be seen today on almost any basketball court in the world.

… Steve Nash and James Harden.

Nash won back to back MVPs in his first two years with D’Antoni in PHX. He led the NBA in Assist per game for three straight years in PHX.

**Nash & Harden Assist bumps in first season under D’Antoni:**

* Nash: 8.8 -> 11.5
* Harden: 7.5 -> 11.2

Harden finished Top 3 in MVP voting every year under D’Antoni in HOU and won the award during their 2nd year working together.

Harden led the league in Points per game three times and Assist per game once during D’Antoni’s HOU era.

No Second Spectrum data exists to show Nash's evolution from DAL → PHX, but it does for Harden. I looked through the evolution of his numbers with D’Antoni. It is a fascinating look at innovation and the evolution of finding what actions created the highest PPP yield and cracked the defensive shell the most and then leaning into those.

During our conversation, Coach D’Antoni mentioned that the HOU ISO style of basketball wasn’t his preferred approach, but it provided the best chance to win a championship against the GSW challenge they needed to solve. The data behind these HOU teams illustrates the team's offensive profile evaluation.

**Harden’s PnR Timeline:**

*Filtered for 500 min PnRs (Top 106 and 105 players).*

* (15-16) Pre-MD: 2080 total - 33 Per 100 - 0.967 (15th)
* (16-17) Post-MD: **4014 total** \- 65.8 per 100 - 1.055 (4th)

*\^\^ 790 MORE PnR than last year's leader Jalen Brunson (3224)*

**Harden’s PnR → ISO Timeline:**

* (17-18) Year 2:
   * PnR: 3353 Total - 60 per 100 - 1.020 (18th)
   * ISO: 922 total - 18 Per 100 - 1.196
* (18-19) Year 3:
   * PnR: 2699 Total - 46.8 Per 100 - 1.063 (4th)
   * ISO: 1625 Total - 28.2 per 100 - 1.167

Shifting these PnR actions into ISO actions generated more PPP for HOU and forced opposing defenses to develop strategies that only emerged when facing HOU. Teams didn’t have the opportunity to practice these coverages from night to night against other NBA.

Harden, D’Antoni, and HOU developed a unique system that set them apart from others at the time and gave them an advantage in nearly every PO series.

Coach D’Antoni articulated it perfectly during our conversation:

Jalen Brunson,"""Jalen Brunson"" OR ""Jalen"" OR ""Jalen Dime"" OR ""Brunson""",2025-02-03,nbadiscussion,1iheg27,"Recently got back into NBA, an observation...","I used to watch NBA back in the early 2000's and then dropped off (couldn't watch the games any more). I recently went to NYC and caught a Knicks game and it got me wanting to start following it again (or trying to - will come to that in a moment). I've got the NBA League Pass so I can watch the game over here in the UK and since November I've watched lots. Mostly the Knicks, but quite a few others to try and get a feel for other teams./players. It's hard because I forgot how many games there are, hard to stay up to date!

Something I've noticed is that the scoring seems easier now. Dunks are very common, as are three pointers. But the main thing I noticed is just how back to back it is. One team scores, then the other.... repeat 60 times. There seems to be less defensive challenge than I remember and lots more free throws. Now I may be wrong, maybe my memory is hazy, maybe the players are a better standard across the board now, maybe things are just a faster pace (if so, why?)... but it seems less challenging to score? Almost to the point where scoring isn't really a big deal unless it's the final seconds of a game and both teams are tied. Again, just my perception, but is that a common one others share who have been following for longer?

The players seem to have a lot more of a relaxed swag about them. They even look like they don't have to try as hard. Maybe things pick up later towards the end of the season? I'm obviously still getting to grips with noticing things, but I like the way Jalen Brunson plays, he has good footwork and plays a bit more 'street' in a way...

I don't watch football (soccer) but over here we have Match of the Day, it's a really great show that sums up all of the games, shows the highlights of each and there is a discussion about tactics, players, etc. I can't seem to find anything that good in terms of an NBA show which does the same. I also can't find a decent site that gives a really good weekly summary. The NBA website is a bit of a mess, too much noise. Any recommendations of where to read up to stay up to date? That's another problem I'm having. 

TLDR: basically, NBA feels very different to how it was back in the early 2000s, which is expected, but it feels too easy and there doesn't seem to be much urgency around some games. Is my observation fair or do I just need to get into it more?

If my observations are correct in any way, could someone explain why; rules changes, changes that NBA fans don't like, what are the main things NBA fans moan about or would change, any tips on HOW to watch NBA (like follow just one team, or a few, or try and watch all game highlights etc?). I'd be really interested to know. :)",0,13,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iheg27/recently_got_back_into_nba_an_observation/,2025-02-04 05:07:51,"It’s funny you mention how easily teams score and how they go back-and-forth so frequently because many fans complain about the amount of bricked 3s that happen (even though field goal percentage is at its highest since the early 2000s thus supporting your argument). What you’re seeing is a pace of play difference. In the 2000s they made similar percentages of shots but they took both less 3s and less shots overall. There were good defenses then of course, and based on per 100 possession scoring there are good defenses now, but when simply more possessions happen more scoring happens and guys may slack off a bit to conserve energy. 

As for the presentation of the game, the traditional media landscape in the US isn’t as kind to the NBA as Europe is to soccer. The NFL gets that sort of treatment. We had NBA Today and Inside the NBA for many years and those did exactly what you explained but social media and viewership habits changed it dramatically. However, NBA has found an excellent niche in social media, boasting more social media followers than the MLB, NHL and NFL combined. || Game Time on NBA League Pass is a good highlights show, which rounds up all the action on any given night.

It can be sporadic for when it’s available on the app for some reason, but it’s a nice way of keeping up to date in a 25 minute show. || One of the biggest shifts over the last 20 years is 3-pointers being more dominant - many teams have shifted towards spacing the floor + focusing on 3pt opportunities, which has resulted in less contact play closer to the basket + faster offenses that create space. This drive for 3pt efficiency used to be celebrated in the early 2010s but is increasingly less popular as many teams play the same way, and it doesn’t promote interaction between teams like plays inside the arc/paint area used to - probs one of the main things fans moan about.

The league has also consistently promoted offensive play but imposing fouls on previously-allowed tools from defenders, and officials are a lot more lax on offensive fouls (look at Harden step backs or weak contact compilations on NBA; many players now add “playing for contact” into their offensive toolkit) - also a main complaint for fans.

I personally pay the 4 USD for an Athletic subscription, they have beat writers with fantastic content for both teams + lots of good analysis with little fluff. The League pass suffers from the same fractionalization of games as the Prem in the UK - I.e. ABC/ESPN/Amazon to your Sky/ITV/Amazon split. Game highlights are on YouTube, NBA posts them fast after the game ends. 

We used to have a show called Inside the NBA that was similar to MOTD, but they got canned this year as league rights were picked up by a mix of new providers who didn’t extend their contract. They were widely popular - imagine if MOTD was off BBC.

Lots of other topics fans moan about - the consistent fouling to ruin end of game situations, the various issues with officiating standard, news market dominated by few star teams, high cost to watch live games (both in person/on TV legally), etc.

I personally still think the game and product is fun to watch, and just like any other commercialised league there are problems that can be fixed. There’s no right way to watch it - find what you’re interested in, you can follow the Knicks + other games but ultimately you know what you like best! || From my perspective of watching since the early 90s the league has completely turned into business & entertainment. Players are more concerned about getting paid and not getting injured then they are about winning games. Wear runway clothing to the arena, put up a couple highlights and post to your social media that's the goal now. 

You can still catch some games where everyone is trying hard in the playoffs but the regular season nearly everyone other than a few guys are just coasting. A lot of guys coast playoff games too until the 4th quarter. It's really disappointing, I used to watch nearly all 82 games + playoffs of my hometown team. Now I watch 10-20 regular season games.. || Thanks, that's interesting to read. 

Yeah I think maybe the whole social media way of interacting of fans and sharing news stories is a little too modern for my taste. Feels scattered and brief, whereas I like to sit down and read longer articles. Showing my age here! || It's also harder to play defense. Offensive skill sets 1-5 have improved. Spacing is greatly improved which requires more ground to cover. You can't just park your C and PF near the paint to help rim protect. Less post ups happen. It's less energy for the most part guarding in the post than face guarding 30 feet from the basket. A lot of people see the offensive numbers and assume defense is worse instead of seeing that offenses are faster and defense is harder. 

We also tend to forget all of the bad games that happened in the past and assume every game was the Bulls and Lakers levels of entertaining. Social media hasn't helped. Someone makes a statement and then people jump on that opinion without any knowledge. It landslides into all these people that don't care about the NBA having this opinion that it's worse. It's something that has hurt society as a whole with these takes being ran with without any actual research and not just when it comes to sports. || Ah weirdly I've not seen that yet. Thanks, will check it out. || Thanks for this, really given me a lot of insight! || Wdym? Inside the NBA is still around lol. The rights got bought out by ESPN but they’re still operating as they always did. You can look up the youtube channel now and confirm. || That's exactly the same with football over here, not that I was ever interested in it, but if you watch a Premier League Game compared to a League 1 game, it's completely different. 

Think things will improve? || I get it. I miss turning on the TV Saturday morning as a kid and watching Inside Stuff with Ahmad Rashad and Summer Sanders (had a huge crush on her as a kid), as well as Sportscenter when it was relevant. Those days as sports fans seem gone. 

Queue someone telling me about some Youtuber. || I don't see how they improve with the amount of money involved. The only way to make it more competitive would be to drastically reduce the regular season, something like 50 games. Don't see that happening though. || Maybe that's why I've found getting back into it a bit overwhelming. There isn't a decent centralised place to get a good overview of what's happening week on week, instead it's 'check these thirty 20 second highlight reels!'

Everybody has been losing their minds over the return for Luka. I'm a laker fan and I won't pretend we didn't get a steal of a deal. We obviously did. This thread is not about how unfair the deal was, as no deal that sends Luka out will be balanced. 

All the feelings and outrage are valid. However, I find some of the loudest objections to be vague and speculative. Everyone seems to believe that there was a better deal with the Mavs goals in mind. I'm willing to be convinced. That's what I'd like to explore. 

This thread is not about how stupid it is to pass on extending Luka. This thread is not for guessing at conspiracy theories. This is not about more undeserved slander at AD, a legit top 10 force who has been talked about like he's a dying Hassan whiteside about to go bad in the fridge (btw he is going to be incredible next to Kyrie and Lively/gafford). Check any of the other threads for a healthy dose of that.

Nico Harrison and the Mavs have talked about wanting to win now and make a dominant pairing for the next 3-4 years. They said that they chose the deal they wanted and operated in silence to avoid a circus. Most don't agree with this, many don't buy that spin, and this has obviously been a fiasco. However, at least it hasn't been drawn out like with Jimmy and the Heat, or Jimmy and the wolves, or Dame and the Blazers, or AD and the pelicans, or Kawhi with the Spurs. We could go on and on. Those teams really couldn't max their value or get the deal they wanted, and the player had plenty of control, which is far from desirable when your priority is to Win Now and not to rebuild yet. That's a valid concern. As upset as Mavs fans rightfully are right now, their team is still ready to win now and that's hard to keep hating for long.

So let's follow the premise: You are Nico and the Mavs. You want to keep this quick and clean. You want to pick the deal you want and just make it happen. You don't want a public auction because you don't want to let anyone influence the end result, which you have seen go wrong several times in recent years. You want to win now with Kyrie and the rest of the squad you've got. You're super done with Luka and ownership is with you.

You can basically take your pick, but they have to be available in that deal. Joker, Shai, and Wemby are not going to be available, and likely not giannis either. The Cavs, Celtics, Thunder, and Knicks probably don't want to rock the boat. The Grizz may consider swapping Ja for Luka, but otherwise they'd be too redundant having them both if the mavs get JJJ instead. I don't think they would do it. I doubt the wolves move Ant for Luka though it's not impossible to imagine, just unlikely. I doubt the Mavs value Booker over AD. Outside of that, I struggle to find a Win Now deal better than a package around AD. Maybe the package could've been squeezed for a few more drops, but then you risk losing control of the situation and having a dragged out circus. So...

Who exactly do you want that's actually going to be available to you? Who fits with this squad? Based on who you perceive as relatively available, who are you asking for?

OR

You are the GM of your favorite team. You heard that there's a silent auction for Luka. You leak => No Luka for you. The Mavs only want Win Now offers. What's your best offer?




EDIT: Welp, this was fun. A lot of you wanted to debate about whether or not Nico properly squeezed the Lakers, so to all of you, let me say one final time, I agree that Nico did a shit job and, even given these circumstances, should have done better than he did with the Lakers. 

I agree with many of you that an open auction could have, at the least, gotten the Mavs Knecht, Reaves, and more picks. Totally true. It's also clear that Nico and ownership accepted that the cost of a silent process was not optimizing the margins of the package. Agree or disagree all you want, but considering how he is being talked about right now, if you are Nico and committed to moving on from Luka, silence is probably the safest choice, in which backlash comes in one haymaker instead of a drawn out war. Instead, he got to choose his guy, and that's what he did. In other comparable Big Star trades, the team trading the star out rarely gets who they wanted. That's big. 

As far as other offers go, I'm not going to do the due diligence of looking up who has what number of picks, but here's a list of packages that you guys suggested that I felt might be worth the Mavs interest. I did not include many Max Christie types, as our conversations were largely about the core level of the package

OKC Chet + JDub 
BOS Jaylen Brown, Derek White, Jrue Holiday
MIN Ant
HOU Amen + Jabari + Alpie + Jalen
CLE Mobley + Garland 
MIA Bam + Herro
MEM JJJ + Bane
ORL Paolo + Franz + Suggs + WCJ
PHI Maxey + PG + McCain
CHA Miller

Of these, I think that only some are plausible. I don't think OKC, BOS, HOU, MEM, CLE or NYK want to shake up their success by bringing in a player who is going to change their entire offensive identity and defensive vulnerability. I think MIN is resistant to letting go of Ant for Luka, as they are probably more confident in Ant staying than Luka. 
That leaves ORL, CHA, and PHI. And if I'm the Mavs trying to win now, those are the most risky for winning now. If I choose anything other than the Lakers package, it's probably ORL. But even then, I think the AD package would be better. 

Thanks for participating, everyone!",34,157,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ih58jy/your_best_win_now_offer_for_luka_doncic/,2025-02-03 19:50:32,"I find the logic of wanting to win now and trading Luka to be slightly incongruent, he just helped them get to the finals, - Davis doesn’t make them more of a contender than they were before and so it doesn’t really make sense from that front and therefore if you’re trading away Luka your priority should be maximizing returns.    

JJJ and Bane would be an intriguing framework for a deal, Bam and Herro is another one, Chet and Williams and picks is another I’d consider.   

Even if you were set on Davis that package was not the best you could do at minimum you should be adding Reaves and potentially Knecht and the other pick || I don't think the issue is AD. He is a great piece in a Luka trade. I dont think there is a better player that is available.

I think the issue is that they didn't get anything else.
I would have expected all the 1st, all the seconds, all the swaps that the Lakers can do. 

I would also expect a Dalton or Reaves or both. 

Even if Luka and AD were identical players, AD being 6 years older, is worth more than one 1st. || I think the problem is with the starting premise. That it has to be a win now move, and that it has to be kept secret. Why?

I think from the reporting its clear Niko Harrison wanted AD and no one else and that was the entire premises. That he valued AD higher, likely than anyone on earth. That's the only explanation of how you let Rob Pelinka finesse you out of Dalton Knecht and the 2031 pick at the last minute and don't call a single other team or tell him to get lost. Somehow the Lakers seemed to have the leverage here.

Rob Pelinka is trying to play hard ball about the 2031 pick and Dalton Knecht and you don't even make a call about Chet? Palo? Mobley? JJJ? Amen Thompson? Hell, call the Bucks up about Giannis lol. This entire process was malpractice. || I think honestly as the Mavs I'd still likely get AD, but also include Reaves, to either play SG or as a 6moy type player. I think the mavs are constructed well but definitely lacking a 2nd off the dribble creator. Or even potentially get a 4th team involved to get the lakers to deal Reaves and or knecht plus a pick to aquire another win now player.

On the other hand, as a wolves fan, I don't think we trade ANT. We probably offer something absolutely terrible around randle and the few picks we have, but hey with nico on the line who knows. || I think the Celtics could have logically offered Brown and Prichard and a couple of firsts and it feels as good as the deal at the very least. Throw in Holiday and I’m still fine with it. || The only teams that make sense to trade for Luka without any way for the receiving GM to get assurances that Luka would be interested in re-signing would be the Lakers, Clippers, Heat, and maybe the Knicks.  Without the supermax on the table, Luka gets equal money signing with any team in 2026, and should only ask for a 2+1 deal to maximize his earnings.  That depresses his value compared to trading him after he's signed a supermax extension and is under contract for 5 years. Maybe a team like Memphis or OKC that traded for him could get a return in a S&T if he doesn't want to re-sign, but maybe the Lakers just clear cap space and sign him outright in 2026.  Is it worth Jalen Williams and 5 FRP if the Thunder only get 1+ seasons of Luka and have to hope he wants to stay?  It's not an easy question to answer.

Within those limitations, Anthony Davis is the best player the Mavs could acquire for Luka.  He's better than Kawhi or Harden, better than Jimmy Butler, better than KAT or Brunson.  I think a lot of the outrage comes from the fact that the Lakers emptied out the asset chest for Davis; two #2 picks on rookie deals, the #4 pick, a solid starter on a cheap contract, and 3 additional first round picks.  In comparison, AD, Max Christie and a single FRP seems inadequate, when the Mavs could have gotten Knecht and a second FRP without anybody saying ""wow, the Mavs won this deal."" || The problem is we don't know if Luka would be willing to re-sign in most cities. I think that rules out OKC, CLE, DET, MEM, ORL, etc. since they wouldn't want to take that risk.

Given that I think AD is probably the best individual player they could have come away with. || AD is one of the better win now moves for sure. But there were better opportunities to be comparably win now without sacrificing their entire future. Which this trade did, given there future draft picks. But I’ll take a crack at all the realistic (maybe semi realistic) offers that I think would have still allowed the Mavs to remain contenders while also having a future.

Obvious answer: trading for AD but also getting Knecht and a pick (if not Reaves as well)

But moving on:

- Celtics: Jaylen Brown + 3-4 firsts - I think Celtics would go for this, but Mavs get a 2 way star and future assets (slightly less win now than they were with Luka)
- Heat: Bam Adebayo + Tyler Herro - Mavs get a top tier defensive center and an offensive weapon (imo would be a better team than current)
- Magic: Paulo/Franz + Suggs + 2 firsts - Get a young rising star, a young two way defensive star, and future assets (slightly less win now)
- 76ers: Embiid + Mccain + 1 first or Maxey + 3 firsts - Embiid is still a MvP caliber player when healthy, imo better than AD, obviously major health concerns but what result in a serious discount where Mavs could get Mccain and a future draft asset. Also could be a Maxey move plus future assets
- Thunder: Chet + 4 firsts - I think Thunder at the very least consider this, Mavs would be less win now than with AD but would be win now for a significantly longer period
- Grizzlies: JJJ + Bane - Young two star in JJJ, and Bane is a borderline all star caliber player. Would improve their lineup for years to come 
- Nuggets: Jamal Murray + MPJ + 4-5 firsts (add Christian Braun also if needed) - I think the Nuggets if they knew Luka was available would have made everything except Jokic available and sent whatever was possibly needed to get it done
- Wolves: Ant + Gobert (maybe needs an additional item from Dallas) - Young superstar and an elite defensive center, I think Wolves would swap Ant for Luka not sure about alongside Gobert
- Suns: Dbook + 3-4 firsts or KD + 4 firsts - Both of these moves would have made Mavs comparably a good enough contender as they were with Luka but also adds assets
- Pelicans: Zion + Herbert Jones + 2 firsts - Obviously this would never go considering conditioning issues are obviously very important to Mavs, but get an elite player out of Zion and a top tier perimeter defender in Herbert Jones plus picks
- Jazz: Markannen + Kessler + 4-5 firsts - 2 young players with enormous potential, and I believe Ainge would have sent a boatload of picks as well

Overall, I think that Heat package would be the winner if we’re talking purely win now as in this season/next season. But if I were a normal GM (as in someone who actually cares about further than 3 years in the future), I’d take all these trades over the current iteration with AD || I guess my issue is I don’t see this as a win now team.  To me they shortened their window.  Kyrie and AD isn’t a pairing I believe in to win a championship.  Selling off a top 5 player and not getting a haul of assets, and instead getting an older player with a history of missing games and seemingly nearing the end of their prime in an attempt to “win now” is the strange part of the trade.  With that being said, if that’s their goal there might not be a better available trade. || I mean this post is just wrong. The biggest problem is that AD necessarily isn't bad, but trading him straight-up for Luka (which is what happened essentially) is a horrible return. I doubt Mavs fans would've been as mad if they got AD + both firsts, 2 swaps, Reaves, Christie, and Knecht for Luka, Kleber, Morris, and a 2nd rounder.

Neither am I completely sold on the fit. Nico Harrison did such a good job of building a team to fit to Luka's strengths/weaknesses, I have no idea why he would dump the centerpiece of the contender he made. Kyrie has always operated best as an off-ball, iso player. He excelled next to Lebron, Luka, and KD/Harden, but struggled when he had to take on the primary facilitator role (Cleveland pre-Lebron, Boston, and Brooklyn when KD was injured/before Harden got there). Gafford/Lively are good roll men, but I doubt Kyrie would be as effective getting them the ball as Luka. AD pretty much plays a similar roll (although much better), but all three of them aren't great floor spacers, and I'm not sure what their go-to half court offensive would be now. I similarly don't think Dinwiddie would be that great running the floor, and the rest of the Dallas core are 3 and D wings. Running lineups of AD + one of Gafford/Lively also pushes PJ to the 3, which I think isn't his strong suit. In sum, the defensive fit seems great, but there's a lot of positional redundancy on offense and not enough facilitating for it to be effective.

In terms of who the Mavs could have gotten from other teams, I'd like to think that anyone outside of Jokic, Wemby, Giannis, Shai, and Tatum were on the table. I doubt Phoenix refuses to trade Booker or that the Twolves would rather have Ant over Luka. Both of them provide better fits imo to how the current Mavs team is built.

I think the bigger question is if the Mavs could have landed multiple great players for Luka. Would the Sixers have been willing to give up PG, Maxey, and McCain? You talk about not wanting to rock the boat, but if the Mavs had asked  for Jdub and Chet, would OKC really have passed on creating the best backcourt in NBA history? Similarly, would Boston have said no if Dallas wanted Brown and White? Would Cleveland have passed on giving up Mitchell and Mobley in return for a proven playoff leader? I know his dad works for the front office, but would the Knicks really value Brunson and OG to the point of saying no to the potential of a generational player? It seems that Nico didn't even ask around regarding these options, and that's even crazier than trading Luka to me. || Maxey, McCain, and picks for Luka? Philly prays for health and would have an insane starting lineup when healthy. Luka and Embiid would be a turbocharged version of Harden and Embiid. For Dallas it gives them a new backcourt of extremely promising young talent. I guess even this is way more of a future plan than a win now though. They would need to make a second trade for a big.

Maybe if the Mavs could've gotten Garland and Jarrett Allen or something. Maybe Mobley and Garland? That feels substantially more fair than what the Mavs actually got. But I kind of doubt the Cavs would want to blow up their squad right now. || Most of what I disagree with when it comes to the trade is the rationale. I don’t think they’re the kind of team to be making a win now trade. If anything, I think they’ve been getting worse over the years and it’s just been covered by Luka getting better.

Given the parameters, I think the Lakers actually have the best offer in this situation with AD, but I would assume Reaves + both picks come back. 

I think Giannis from Milwaukee is worth a call. Their window is shutting rapidly and they’re out of assets. 

On one hand I don’t think the Celtics would want to mess with what they’ve got, but Tatum for Luka 1:1 would probably be good for both sides. 

The Cavs are sitting pretty but they haven’t had post season success really - I would again be careful assuming that they wouldn’t be interested, this is Luka Doncic we’re talking about. I think that goes for most teams, they might not be looking to trade but things change when it’s a franchise level player. Mobley + more is more than reasonable to expect. || The problem is that you are making a ton of assumptions that you wouldn't have to make if they actually shopped the deal like they should have. Beyond Wemby and Jokic do we REALLY know anyone else would be off the table? And w/o talking to Doncic do we know which teams he would give the thumbs up to?

The reality is that with a prize as shiny as Doncic we have no way to know what lengths teams would have gone to get him, but we do KNOW they would have been willing to put up a lot more than what Dallas got. || The Knicks would absolutely sniff around a deal for Luka. I think the Cavs and Celtics would too. || Anything on the roster not named Evan Mobley, and any pick/pick swap we have available. Can't pass on the opportunity to get a guy who, at worst, is a top 5 player in the league. || As a Heat fan, and considering they wanted AD. Jimmy, Bam, a FRP and a couple SRP. Love Bam but it’s Luka, Jimmy is out anyways, and hell the picks could basically be adjusted to almost any amount. || Fun thought experiment! 

For most of these teams, Dallas would also get a bunch of first round picks. I think that is one interesting part is that they could have likely got a good selection of players from one team and picks, then used those picks for another good  player from another team if they really wanted to win now.

Just listing the main players below, Im sure any trade would also include more minor players like Max Christie as well.

Atl- Trae Young, Dyson Daniels, Okongwu

Cleveland- Evan Mobley, Donovan Mitchel,

Miami- Bam, Tyler Herro

Phoenix- Devin Booker, Kevin Durrant

Golden State- Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Kuminga

Memphis- JJJ, Bane,

Houston- Amen Thompson, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr,

NYK- Some combo of Jalen Brunson, KAT, OG, Hart

Orlando- Wagner, Paolo, Goga, Isaac,

**I think OKC would have likely paid the most. A hoard of draft picks, Chet, Jalen Williams, Caruso,Hartenstein what ever other small peices they want. Then they could turn around and sell that hoard of draft picks for another really good player if they wanted to.**

None of these players may be as good as AD individually, but the package of them likely exceeds his value, especially if on top of the players they also received a bunch of draft picks or young players that they could flip to another team for another good player. || Rockets delegation here. Take your pick of the roster and draft assets. Build your own package. || If I'm the Mavs, I call up OKC. I tell Presti ""Luka is on the market, I'm wondering if I could strike a deal here"". I tell Presti I want one of SGA or Holmgren, and at least six of their first round picks. SGA or Holmgren + 6 FRP for Luka is more like a package I'd consider for my franchise player. The Thunder have the assets to pull it off. Slim chance they consider it, but that package is way better than any other team could scrap together. || Totally bullshit thinking AD will bring win now situation than Luka. 

There is no playmaker in this team now and all role players in this team are for Luka doncic. Ad fails to be the #1 guy in lakers, how come you will think it is a good deal for Dallas. Lakers fans are all bias, keep convincing this trade is not stupid for mavs || Might have been able to do jokic and mpj for like their 5 and Luka but it really makes no sense and would never happen ||  there isn’t one, Luka at his best is top 3 in the league or even top 2. 

For a long term solution I’d have tried to get a young blue chipper (ie; Brandon Miller, Franz/Paolo, etc), another solid young piece, another flippable piece to turn into more pieces, on top of a boaaaaaaatload of picks. || Here is the best ""win now"" scenario for the Dallas Mavericks:

Keep Luka Doncic. || The financials were also important. The deal leaves the Mavs just $171k under the 1st apron and the Lakers $1.6M under the 2nd apron. It's why the Jazz got two 2nd rounders to accept Jalen Hood-Schino's contract. 

The 2nd apron is almost a hard cap in the new CBA. || Not sure I agree with your parameters here.

I’ve seen a lot of people arguing the same as you - “who would they realistically get who would be better than AD to win now?!” But I think it’s a flawed assumption.

Even IF we are putting aside the fact that Luka is obviously still a win now player and you’re just done with him and want him gone *and* you want to compete right now, I still disagree that it has to be a direct trade for a guy like AD.

Say they shop Luka around and there’s an offer for like…8 first round picks or something. You could easily still turn say..3 of those into AD from the lakers. You could get multiple teams involved and make sure you’re getting a good return but that starts to get really messy and complicated.

I think the premise of “oh it really wasn’t that bad, AD is the best guy they could have gotten in return, he lets them compete now!” is still - intentionally or not - giving Nico a pass on the terrible return that he got.

That’s why the deal is so terrible. He *still* could have gotten AD even if that was his dream player. Just with more of a return.

If you want a ham sandwich and don’t have cash on you, you don’t trade a Rolex directly for the ham sandwich. You sell the Rolex, buy the ham sandwich at market price and then pocket the rest (not a perfect analogy because obviously AD isn’t a ham sandwich). || [removed] || I don't disagree that Rob fleeced the Mavs by saving Reaves, knecht and more picks. Agreed there. But I think there's validity in wanting to work in silence so that you don't lose control, and obviously the cost of that silence was being able to fully squeeze the lemon. 

JJJ and Bane - one of the better realistic suggestions, I just struggle to see how Ja and Luka can fit together. But interesting to say the least. 
Bam and Herro - probably the best suggestion, but this honestly might kill Pat Riley's Heat Culture by sending out the gritty guys, bringing in a guy accused of work ethic issues, and still holding the bag on Jimmy
Chet and Williams - I don't think they'd do it. The thunder are absolutely flying and they don't seem to want to rock the boat. I actually think they are just gonna trade 1 upcoming pick for 2 future picks forever and just maintain their stupid stockpile until this core moves on too, and just do iHart/Caruso style deals and keep the core together. || Not really, he has been hurt more than half the year. This is a team that is .5 games from not even being in the play-in, so on that kind of time scale having AD for 30 more games vs. Luka for 20 makes a difference. The Lakers have more of a cushion built in to wait for him to get healthy.

Also the obvious downside of trying to squeeze somebody in a trade like this is they say “nah we’ll just wait to sign him after next season” and then it comes out that you were trying to shop Luka and he’s pissed. 

None of these small-market teams you mention would like their chances of re-signing Luka and it’s not like Memphis in that scenario would be competitive with the top teams in the league. That would be a worse version of the Lakers where they’d have no defense and Ja is a worse fit off the ball than LeBron. Bam and Herro make like $30 million more more than AD + Christie, so that would have required Miami to take a bunch of dead salary while also trading picks when they don’t have any until 2029. That far in advance I would definitely value a Lakers pick over a Heat one just by virtue of the West being tougher.

Bottom line though is that 90 percent of the league will talk a good game but their owners would rather be decent and collect luxury tax than great and pay luxury tax. The Heat were avoiding the luxury tax when they had peak LeBron and it was not nearly as punitive as the 2nd apron is now. || Mavs should have gotten Knecht and the other way round pick at a minimum, then maybe you can justify it. But honestly the fan backlash has nothing to do with the compensation. Luka was Dirks replacement, the Slovenian wonder boy. || Reportedly they were close to getting all that, and Pelinka pushed back to get Knect and the other FRP off the table.  Again, just insanely bad negotiating from Harrison.  As long as the deal was quiet, **he** should have been the one pushing for more.  

Klutch and AD/LeBron are already at odds with LAL, Pelinka is the one that would have taken more initial heat for shopping AD.  Nobody would have believed that DAL was seriously shopping Luka.

—————-

Back to OP’s question.  AD might have been the best individual player he could get back right this minute.

However, two teams stand out to me with better packages and near/mid-term return.  Knicks and Magic.  You want to push in all your chips for flexible defense and two way offense?  OG/Rob from the Knicks or WCJ(or Issac)/Franz from Orlando would be solid return.  Both include guys around top 20, compared to around top 10 AD, and a rim-protector.  Both also have a want/need for an on-ball creator.  Both could put together more draft capital to give the Mavs options for additional moves.

Hell, I could see the Heat offering a better all around package around Bam that would be appealing.  Bam/Jovic/Highsmith for Luka?  They have all their own picks from ‘28-‘31, plus seconds.",0.0,0.429,0.571,0.8402,0.077,0.789,0.134,0.9954,0.073,0.777,0.15,0.9999
Jalen Brunson,"""Jalen Brunson"" OR ""Jalen"" OR ""Jalen Dime"" OR ""Brunson""",2025-02-03,nbadiscussion,1igllkj,Considering the Mavs Return for Luka in the Context of a Hypothetical Bidding War,"No one denies that the Mavs could have gotten more for Luka. I too thought Shams made a mistake when he first reported it. However I don't think this trade is as bad of a return as most think. The reason is because we need to put ourselves in Nico's shoes and really look at the factors influencing the decision and the potential constraints he was under. I'm going to outline what some alternate trades could have happened if the hypothetical bidding war actually occurred. I only wrote down trades that A. could have potentially been better than receiving AD in the Mavs front office's mind. B could realistically happen, yet I also offer insight on why they possibly wouldn't happen. 

If you're a fan of any of the teams involved please feel free to give your insight. Also if I didn't include a team that you think had a good package please add them. 

Before viewing the alternate trades we need to list a few assumptions and considerations.

1. The Mavs want a win now player to continue to compete at a high level. Emphasis on Defense.

2. They believe Luka is seriously injured or close to serious injury and that will impact him moving forward.

3. They need to trade him to a team that he wants to resign to in order for them to get a good package.

4. Trading Kyrie is hard. Kyrie is the type of player to control his destination by any means. The only teams he would likely want to go to are the Lakers, Miami, Suns, Knicks. The only teams that would try to trade for him are the Lakers, Miami, Suns, the Clippers, and the T Wolves. Only package Mavs would care about is Jimmy Butler or maybe Norm Powell, or Julius Randle. That makes Kyrie almost a given to stay with the Mavs to keep the player assets the Mavs want, to remain competitive. So they also needed to trade for players that would not cause Kyrie to force his way out. Now back to Luka.

These are the following teams that could have offered the Mavs what they were looking for. We are prioritizing player assets because the Mavs indicated no intention of rebuilding. These trades aren't factoring in salary cap. Also you should ask yourself would Luka resign with that team after that trade. If the answer is no, you know why it wasn't considered as an option by the Mavs top brass.

Celtics (JB Holiday)

If the Celtics wanted Luka, which they may not because they too value defense, their offer may have looked like this. I believe they would try to keep Porzingis and White in favor of Trading Brown and Holiday. I'm not sure the Celtics offer this trade. 

Knicks 2 of (Brunson, Bridges, OG, Towns)

Knicks have the players to get Luka but the only combo that would be better than getting AD is Brunson and Towns for Luka. That trade would also be awkward cause it's likely the Mavs would have to move on from Kyrie, which they may not want to or can do. Also Brunson and Towns aren't defensive players. 

Cavs 2 (Mitchell & Allen) or (Garland & Mobley)

I'm sure Cavs could throw in some picks. This is one of the trades that could have competed with the Lakers offer of AD though AD is still the best player offered in this scenario. It also gives the Mavs offense and defense while getting them younger player assets than AD. However Luka resigning with Cle is a mystery.

Lakers better offer AD Reaves Knecht 

This is the head scratcher. Why didn't they get the Lakers shooters as well. Unless Luka is damaged goods, which maybe the story underneath the story. Perhaps Nico was also asked to get under the cap. 

Thunder J Dub Chet

This probably would have been the trade to have made along with a boat load of picks. This trade does create more questions about the fit between SGA and Luka and filling out the rest of the team may prove difficult. Plus I'm not sure both J Dub and Chet would be on the table in this hypothetical. Also would Luka like playing with SGA and resign in OKC?

Grizzlies (Morant) or (Banes + GG Jackson)

Morant is a great on the court player. Not as great off the court. Also not sure the Mavs want to flip Kyrie after this move. Also Morant is not a defensive player. Would Luka resign with the Grizzlies?

Pacers Tyrese Haliburton + Mathurin 

Again we run into a similar problem of having to move Kyrie after this trade. But maybe not because they can all play together due to Haliburton's facilitatiom. Again does Luka resign in Indiana?

Pelicans Murray Zion Ingram or switch any name for Jones and/or Murphy

This one is weird. Why trade Luka for more injury prone and unconditional players? I just wanted to add it as another player assets rich trade but it illustrates the issue. There are not too many landing spots for Luka. Again would Luka resign with the pels? Maybe for the food.


Honorable mentions

Rockets I think the Mavs preferred AD to any combo of Green Sengun and Eason(i think Rox want to build around Thompson. Ik Thompson shouldn't hold up a Luka trade but I'm taking the perspective of the Rox wanting to have something to pair Luka with).

Hawks Trae. Trae is amazing but he's a cut below the other PGs listed. Plus the PR nightmare of Trading Trae for Luka would not allow this to happen though it would have been funny. 

Cooper Flagg

This is an honorary mention because the Mavs don't want to rebuild. And Luka would not resign with the team who got the #1 pick. 

I feel like seeing these options, outlined, shows that Nico did not have an easy job when given the directive to move Luka and get under the tax. AD is actually a decent return. And while you may believe the Mavs should have rebuilt with picks and prospects, the Mavs don't agree. Also Trading Luka to another team makes the pick even more worthless if Luka continues playing at his current level, which the Mavs question. Luka's health also may have become a bigger issue in a bidding war. It's easy to bash this trade, but I don't think the Mavs could have found much better given the circumstances and it's a pretty good return in terms of the player they received back, especially when you factor in the alternatives and see the potential options.",0,17,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1igllkj/considering_the_mavs_return_for_luka_in_the/,2025-02-03 04:50:01,"At an absolute bare minimum, getting other teams involved puts pressure on LAL to throw their best offer at Luka rather than what they did. Reaves, another pick, maybe some swaps, etc. it also allows them to build a 3 teamer to maximize value which was impossible with the way they went about it || Timberwolves for Anthony Edwards also. Zach Lowe made the great point that if you make this trade after the season it's a much wider landscape. Maybe Chet never comes back healthy and OKC crashes out in round 2? Maybe the Rockets get upset in round 1 and it becomes clear they need a true Alpha scorer? You never know what can happen, but right now every good team thinks they have a shot at the title and after this season only 1 will get there. The rest will be searching for answers and maybe trying to save their job. That drives the price up, and likely gets you one last shot with Luka. Maybe Dallas crashes out this year cause he's never healthy and Lively doesn't come back, so the fans will be much more understanding to everything. Now with the open bidding you get the Lakers up to Knecht, Reaves, '31 FRP, and 2 pick swaps, and you get a fanbase during the offseason that is more open to considering changing course with Luka. Nobody gets blindsided, the offer gets better. I feel like that just seems like the much better course of action for a number of reasons. 

...also, maybe I'm right, Luka comes back, Lively comes back, Mavs make a run to the finals again and Nico realizes he should do everything in his power to keep and support this generational talent. Guess we'll never know. || The Mavs would not want Ja with Kyrie. Ja and Kyrie are two undersized guards and fill similar ball handling roles. While not a total liability on defense like he used to be, Ja is not a stopper. The Mavs were focused on getting positive defensive assets. I could see Ja + SPJ and/or wells and picks. 

At the end of the day, the Mavs seemed to be laser focused on AD and allegedly someone else that turned them down. My guess is Bucks or Spurs. || Still not a single one of those seems worth it. Maybe jdub and chet and a boatload of picks? || First point: Nico was under no directive to get this done. It was purely his idea. He just wanted Luka gone, so made it happen--for much less than he should have gotten.  
  
As for the value received, I will counter your argument this way: If Nico called his good buddy Rob and offered to undo the trade, would they? Absolutely not. He'd demand extra picks and probably Lively. Luka hasn't played one second for the Lakers yet, and they wouldn't accept anything CLOSE to the package the Mavs got. Hell, if Rob decided to flip Luka before Thursday, he'd demand (and get) something more than the Jazz got for Gobert. The trade is indefensible at every level. || First, yours is the type of high quality, thoughtful post that we should appreciate.  Thank you.

Second, I have to say that I really think there were literally only two options for the type of premier defender and offensive efficiency monster that the Mavs would want: (1) Giannis and (2) AD.  That's it.  When Nico said he had spoken to Kidd about desirable ""archetypes"" I have to guess he meant Giannis and AD being the mobile defensive paint beast who can play the 5 but prefers the 4 and is an absolute monster of efficiency on offense.  It's just those two guys. 

Luka isn't going to stay in MIL.  It was AD or blow up the entire roster, which was not an option while ownership is trying to get approval for a mega gambling/shopping/destination/arena complex.

I think Cuban saw issues with Luka's commitment relative to someone like Dirk, and that was some of the impetus for him selling earlier.  That part is simply wild speculation. || Lol bro the gobert trade they got 4 1st round draft picks a 1st round player from this year and 4 other decent players including Beasley....... gimmie a break the mavs was a good deal. It was a sham... and im a bulls fan sooo I Dont care but it's was a horrible trade.... yall talking bout what coulds happened but none of it did...... it doesnt matter.....it was a sht deal and will go down as the worst trade in the history of the nba.........the facts are mavs are holding the state of Texas for ransom to legalize gambling or their gonna move to Las vegas.....thats what's happening....and the new owners own a huge casino in Vegas already.... facts.... mavs coulda gotten 5 1st rounds picks and players for luka... but they settled for injury prone A.d. whos past his prime and a 2028 1st rounder 3 years away. Who knows who thats gonna be lol...and some no name player gimmie a break...... A.D. and a 1st rounder even next year is not a even deal to luka.....it's not... Luka is the golden boy of the nba right now. ZION is a flop and not the star the NBA thought he was gonna be. Luka is as biggger star than Giannis Ant because Giannis plays in Milwaukee is a small market compared to LA or Dallas..The stars of the NBA are getting old too soo la needs to have a super star in la for the nba to be news worthy snd stay popular its probablythe most popular team and the biggest market for the nba. Its a must have to have a star in la for the nba. LeBron is almost 41, steph Curry 36, chris paul 39 jimmie butler, Demar DeRozan, brooke Lopez, mike conley, James harden, Kevin Durant, jrue holiday, Damion Lillard,  are all 35-36 yrs old. Nba is declining and losing viewers.  LeBron is either retiring or getting told its time to retire in a year or 2 and Lakers got his replacement. Luka and LeBron are not compatible teammates. Lol their not...Luka is the money maker now and the team will build around him. Mavs coulda gotten alot more for luka....there is no doubt. Who wouldn't take that deal for luka lol... any team would have given there next 4 1st rounders for luka. But mavs settled for 1 1st rounder 3 years from now and a past his prime a.d. lol come on.....this deal is about Las vegas. Break the team down and then force a move.....you dont go to the finals last season then destroy your team the next season... nobody does that... pissed off their entire fan base and the arena is gonna be half full.... either Texas legalize gambling and mavs rebuild or they'll be in Las vegas......p.s. I just think this was a forced trade by the nba... didn't the nba put the kabosh and shut down a big deal trade couple years ago? Something doesn't sit right with this trade.... it's just strange || They definitely could have gotten a better return over the Summer. I don't think the T Wolves give up Ant for Luka. I'm not saying they wouldn't. I'm just saying that they need to convince Luka to re-sign after the trade. The T Wolves without Ant is not that attractive of a destination for Luka. I think the Mavs prefer AD to the Rox young core. I agree they should have gotten more out of the Lakers. No question || Obviously, the Mavs are only interested in short-term investment. They don't care about the future and banking on two aging stars. Nico just made the most important decision ever made in NBA history. || That's what I'm saying! The trade isnt as bad in context. And I'm not sure that OKC trades both of them, though they should. Cavs also have a competitive offer. Either way AD was the best player they were getting back right now. || The Lakers would not redo this trade this second no. But if you ask again at the end of the year end of next year and 5 years from now you may get a different response. That's the nature of trades. The Gobert trade went from a Jazz fleece to a win win trade back to a Jazz fleece. I agree that Rob could have gotten more but my point is not much more edit: in the context of trying to continue to compete instead of rebuilding. I outlined the alternatives to show that.

Edit: also there is no way ownership was not in on this decision and that Nico was a solo actor. Ownership was at the very least in and the fact that the Mavs got under the tax indicates it may have been their directive || They got so many picks because they didn't get a player of AD's quality back. They turned into a tanking team. AD is the best player they could have gotten when you consider that they want to compete and that whoever trades for Luka also needs to get him to re-sign and they would need enough assets to make sure they could field a good enough team around him || Nico has said he worked the deal out on his own over several weeks, and that when it was done he presented it to ownership for approval. Said that Patrick Dumont laughed at him at first.

As for undoing the trade, my point is simply that the Lakers KNOW they got Luka on the cheap. They wouldn't trade him here (or anywhere) for anything close to what they gave up. NOBODY WOULD. Only Nico was dumb enough/ego fueled to make THIS deal. Trying to put a semi-positive spin on it is defending the indefensible. Given the context, I firmly believe this will be recalled as the worst trade in league history. I can't think of a worse one. And he's destroyed the goodwill of the city and fan base in the process. It's really unbelievable. || I dont think Ad is worth that much anymore personally. He's not worth A star like Luka. Their not on the same level trade value wise. And then a 1st round pick 3 years away?....I personally think this trade was made or pushed by bigger things behind the scenes... Nba needed a huge trade to happen. And La is a huge market and needs a star to replace Lebron. La has had at least one superstar player their entire existence lol.... nba can't have their most popular org. Not winning or in the conversation. Or without a superstar... Feels like something was forced here. You can even look at the mavs press conference... lol Jason kidd was not happy and the mavs head couldn't even answer simple questions about why the trade happened.... mavs coulda afforded to pay Luka.... mavs are the 4th largest market in the nba. Money isn't the issue... I feel like there's bigger things happening behind the scenes that made this trade happen. And im not a big conspiracy guy, but this trade didn't make any sense. Especially with a 25 year old superstar... something bigger going on here...with the mavs owners, Las vegas, and / or the NBA.... this was or is one of the biggest trades in the history of the nba just cause of how much it didnt make sense......Just my 2 cents || I hear you but this is too big of a decision to be the sole responsibility of a GM. I don't care what Nico says publicly. He was not going to go up there and say the owners told me to get rid of Luka and stay under the luxury tax because they don't want to give him the super max, because that would make ownership seem cheap and get him fired. 

I agree the Lakers got Luka cheap. But not that cheap. AD is by far the best and most impactful player they could have gotten at this time and potentially if they waited. It will only be awful if Luka keeps up this level of play and availability for longer than AD is effective with the Mavs, which seems like a likely bet. But if the team that just went to the Finals with him wants to cut bait. I think that speaks volumes. It will also be awful if AD is a disaster in Dallas. I don't think he will be but it's definitely on the table. Again we may think the Mavs should want to rebuild and get a ton of picks and prospects but they didn't want that. If that's not what they wanted, they definitely got the best player available in AD. If Luka continues to miss a bunch of time and the Lakers flounder in the playoffs due to incompetence, then this trade won't turn out that bad. I think Nico was early on this so he looks crazy. It's like Mark Jackson calling Steph and Klay the best shooting back court in the league. He sounded crazy at the time because they hadn't proved it yet but he was right.

Edit: the goodwill peace will be mended by winning. The Mavericks will be a better team than the Lakers this year and next. Also Dallas doesn't have income tax. That's a big draw for FAs || Yeah because you don't value defense. If you look at the options and what other teams could/ would have offered, AD is by far the best player they are receiving back. If you don't agree please share the alternative player. Stars never really go for the equivalent value. It rarely works that way. Picks aren't that meaningful and the Mavs want to continue to compete. 

I wouldn't put it past the league and Silver to mandate this but some of what you're saying is flawed. The Lakers were ass for the end of Kobe's tenure and had a 2 year window between Kobe and Bron. Bron chose to sign there because of his business endeavors and just what Lake Show symbolizes and ingratiate Laker fans so that he can have some extra defenders for his GOAT case. 

Also this trade makes sense if you think Luka is on his way to some significant injuries and missed time. If you think he'll be healthy then yeah it's a shitty trade but not that shitty cause AD is nice. Also I don't trust the Lakers to surround Luka with talent, but who knows LA is an alluring place. || I appreciate your argument, your sharp thinking, and your coherent argument(s). But more is leaking out from the Lakers side, and they're laughing that they were able to convince Nico that they were taking on all the risk of an overweight player who drinks too much and shrunk the deal from a package that included more picks and more players by ALSO convincing Nico that there were zero suitable trade partners other than them. Your arguments sound like what they sold Nico, so congrats for figuring that out. 

And GMs talk ALL THE TIME. They float ideas long before they involve ownership. I don't think the Adelson/Dumont faction was involved or cared. I bet they do now, and Nico will be on a very short leash if the Mavs fall flat in the playoffs.",0.245,0.755,0.0,-0.5994,0.08,0.806,0.113,0.9903,0.085,0.778,0.137,0.9993

Jalen Brunson,"""Jalen Brunson"" OR ""Jalen"" OR ""Jalen Dime"" OR ""Brunson""",2025-02-04,nbadiscussion,1iheg27,"Recently got back into NBA, an observation...","I used to watch NBA back in the early 2000's and then dropped off (couldn't watch the games any more). I recently went to NYC and caught a Knicks game and it got me wanting to start following it again (or trying to - will come to that in a moment). I've got the NBA League Pass so I can watch the game over here in the UK and since November I've watched lots. Mostly the Knicks, but quite a few others to try and get a feel for other teams./players. It's hard because I forgot how many games there are, hard to stay up to date!

Something I've noticed is that the scoring seems easier now. Dunks are very common, as are three pointers. But the main thing I noticed is just how back to back it is. One team scores, then the other.... repeat 60 times. There seems to be less defensive challenge than I remember and lots more free throws. Now I may be wrong, maybe my memory is hazy, maybe the players are a better standard across the board now, maybe things are just a faster pace (if so, why?)... but it seems less challenging to score? Almost to the point where scoring isn't really a big deal unless it's the final seconds of a game and both teams are tied. Again, just my perception, but is that a common one others share who have been following for longer?

The players seem to have a lot more of a relaxed swag about them. They even look like they don't have to try as hard. Maybe things pick up later towards the end of the season? I'm obviously still getting to grips with noticing things, but I like the way Jalen Brunson plays, he has good footwork and plays a bit more 'street' in a way...

I don't watch football (soccer) but over here we have Match of the Day, it's a really great show that sums up all of the games, shows the highlights of each and there is a discussion about tactics, players, etc. I can't seem to find anything that good in terms of an NBA show which does the same. I also can't find a decent site that gives a really good weekly summary. The NBA website is a bit of a mess, too much noise. Any recommendations of where to read up to stay up to date? That's another problem I'm having. 

TLDR: basically, NBA feels very different to how it was back in the early 2000s, which is expected, but it feels too easy and there doesn't seem to be much urgency around some games. Is my observation fair or do I just need to get into it more?

If my observations are correct in any way, could someone explain why; rules changes, changes that NBA fans don't like, what are the main things NBA fans moan about or would change, any tips on HOW to watch NBA (like follow just one team, or a few, or try and watch all game highlights etc?). I'd be really interested to know. :)",0,13,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iheg27/recently_got_back_into_nba_an_observation/,2025-02-04 05:07:51,"It’s funny you mention how easily teams score and how they go back-and-forth so frequently because many fans complain about the amount of bricked 3s that happen (even though field goal percentage is at its highest since the early 2000s thus supporting your argument). What you’re seeing is a pace of play difference. In the 2000s they made similar percentages of shots but they took both less 3s and less shots overall. There were good defenses then of course, and based on per 100 possession scoring there are good defenses now, but when simply more possessions happen more scoring happens and guys may slack off a bit to conserve energy. 

As for the presentation of the game, the traditional media landscape in the US isn’t as kind to the NBA as Europe is to soccer. The NFL gets that sort of treatment. We had NBA Today and Inside the NBA for many years and those did exactly what you explained but social media and viewership habits changed it dramatically. However, NBA has found an excellent niche in social media, boasting more social media followers than the MLB, NHL and NFL combined. || Game Time on NBA League Pass is a good highlights show, which rounds up all the action on any given night.

It can be sporadic for when it’s available on the app for some reason, but it’s a nice way of keeping up to date in a 25 minute show. || One of the biggest shifts over the last 20 years is 3-pointers being more dominant - many teams have shifted towards spacing the floor + focusing on 3pt opportunities, which has resulted in less contact play closer to the basket + faster offenses that create space. This drive for 3pt efficiency used to be celebrated in the early 2010s but is increasingly less popular as many teams play the same way, and it doesn’t promote interaction between teams like plays inside the arc/paint area used to - probs one of the main things fans moan about.

The league has also consistently promoted offensive play but imposing fouls on previously-allowed tools from defenders, and officials are a lot more lax on offensive fouls (look at Harden step backs or weak contact compilations on NBA; many players now add “playing for contact” into their offensive toolkit) - also a main complaint for fans.

I personally pay the 4 USD for an Athletic subscription, they have beat writers with fantastic content for both teams + lots of good analysis with little fluff. The League pass suffers from the same fractionalization of games as the Prem in the UK - I.e. ABC/ESPN/Amazon to your Sky/ITV/Amazon split. Game highlights are on YouTube, NBA posts them fast after the game ends. 

We used to have a show called Inside the NBA that was similar to MOTD, but they got canned this year as league rights were picked up by a mix of new providers who didn’t extend their contract. They were widely popular - imagine if MOTD was off BBC.

Lots of other topics fans moan about - the consistent fouling to ruin end of game situations, the various issues with officiating standard, news market dominated by few star teams, high cost to watch live games (both in person/on TV legally), etc.

I personally still think the game and product is fun to watch, and just like any other commercialised league there are problems that can be fixed. There’s no right way to watch it - find what you’re interested in, you can follow the Knicks + other games but ultimately you know what you like best! || From my perspective of watching since the early 90s the league has completely turned into business & entertainment. Players are more concerned about getting paid and not getting injured then they are about winning games. Wear runway clothing to the arena, put up a couple highlights and post to your social media that's the goal now. 

You can still catch some games where everyone is trying hard in the playoffs but the regular season nearly everyone other than a few guys are just coasting. A lot of guys coast playoff games too until the 4th quarter. It's really disappointing, I used to watch nearly all 82 games + playoffs of my hometown team. Now I watch 10-20 regular season games.. || Thanks, that's interesting to read. 

Yeah I think maybe the whole social media way of interacting of fans and sharing news stories is a little too modern for my taste. Feels scattered and brief, whereas I like to sit down and read longer articles. Showing my age here! || It's also harder to play defense. Offensive skill sets 1-5 have improved. Spacing is greatly improved which requires more ground to cover. You can't just park your C and PF near the paint to help rim protect. Less post ups happen. It's less energy for the most part guarding in the post than face guarding 30 feet from the basket. A lot of people see the offensive numbers and assume defense is worse instead of seeing that offenses are faster and defense is harder. 

We also tend to forget all of the bad games that happened in the past and assume every game was the Bulls and Lakers levels of entertaining. Social media hasn't helped. Someone makes a statement and then people jump on that opinion without any knowledge. It landslides into all these people that don't care about the NBA having this opinion that it's worse. It's something that has hurt society as a whole with these takes being ran with without any actual research and not just when it comes to sports. || Ah weirdly I've not seen that yet. Thanks, will check it out. || Thanks for this, really given me a lot of insight! || Wdym? Inside the NBA is still around lol. The rights got bought out by ESPN but they’re still operating as they always did. You can look up the youtube channel now and confirm. || That's exactly the same with football over here, not that I was ever interested in it, but if you watch a Premier League Game compared to a League 1 game, it's completely different. 

Think things will improve? || I get it. I miss turning on the TV Saturday morning as a kid and watching Inside Stuff with Ahmad Rashad and Summer Sanders (had a huge crush on her as a kid), as well as Sportscenter when it was relevant. Those days as sports fans seem gone. 

Queue someone telling me about some Youtuber. || I don't see how they improve with the amount of money involved. The only way to make it more competitive would be to drastically reduce the regular season, something like 50 games. Don't see that happening though. || Maybe that's why I've found getting back into it a bit overwhelming. There isn't a decent centralised place to get a good overview of what's happening week on week, instead it's 'check these thirty 20 second highlight reels!' I'll persevere and watch what I can.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.035,0.836,0.129,0.9953,0.071,0.77,0.16,0.999

With Calvin Booth Not Under Contract for Next Season, Denver Should Look In a New Direction.","Calvin Booth was promoted to President of Nuggets Basketball Operations in June 2022. His first moves were to trade Will Barton and Monte Morris for KCP and Ish Smith, and signing Bruce Brown and DeAndre Jordan. He drafted Christian Braun at 21 and traded a protected 2030 1st round pick and JaMychal Green for Payton Watson and 2 2nds. An excellent off-season. The Nuggets would go to win the 2023 title.

Booth's vision has been to build through the draft, and bank heavy on young players instead of veterans. His moves post title have drained the team of assets and left multiple bad contracts on their books, limiting the team's flexibility to improve the roster. 

Traded a protected 2029 1st round pick for Julian Strwather, Jalen Picket and Hunter Tyson and gave all 3 guaranteed deals.

Reggie Jackson MLE + player option.

Zeke Nnaji 4/32.

3 seconds to salary dump Reggie.

Dario MLE + player option.

Jeff Green out.

KCP out.

Justin Holiday out.

2 seconds to move up 6 spots to draft DaRon Holmes.

Russ in.

Jamal max.

AG 4/133

Calvin Booth had an excellent 2022 off-season, but Denver currently finds themselves without many assets or ways to improve outside internal development after 2 seasons of asset mismanagement, poor signings, and banking on internal development. 

Calvin called himself the ""steward of Nikola Jokić's prime"". I think he has failed in that task, and the team should look to a new vision going forward. ",273,105,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ikpe55/denver_was_1_of_4_teams_not_to_make_a_deadline/,2025-02-08 10:12:57,"Honestly the only egregious mistakes here are the player options (maybe paying Tyson and Pickett but those are such small errors). Reggie was good last year, Holiday and Green are replacement level players (and Jeff got a raise)


Russ has been good


You always pay Jamal and AG, no team would've let them walk. 


DaRon Holmes getting injured was a bummer but not his fault. || Denver has one of the best starting 5 in the NBA.

Denver was also one of the teams that suffered the most at hands of the latest CBA. Were there some mistakes like Saric or Reggie? Sure. But Russ was a good sign for example, and letting go of KCP was 100% a good call in hindsight.

Were there some forced moves like MPJ or Jamal? Ofc, but Denver is so low profile, no star free agent is coming there, Jokic or no. AG was 100% a must pay.

Overall, Booth did ok job, and looking at other GMs i see no one else who would be a clear upgrade at his place. Mistakes that were made are so low profile that even if all the thing panned out in the best possible way instead Denver maybe has 1 more rotational player. Maybe.

What Denver needs is Jamal and MPJ to play like a fringe all star players and for the team to be healthy. || They're 3rd in the west and all 3 of the young guys (Braun, Strawther and Watson) are all showing growth this season and playing major minutes at the same time. || Not sure it’s worth a firing, but Calvin “Player Option” Booth is a thing. No idea why we needed to give Reggie, Westbrook, and Saric all player options. No one else was even trying to sign them. If anything those deals should have had team options.

The giving away of 2nd round picks to undo mistakes on the player options, plus the Zeke contract were just flat out bad decisions and have hamstrung the teams ability to do anything material to improve the team.

Is that fireable. Probably not, but as a nuggets fan I don’t have a ton of confidence in his ability to continue to build this team. He seams overly convinced in his ability to identify young guys that can fill key roles on the team and at the same time has had conflicts with Malone who I would much rather keep than Booth. || I don't see the point. His vision makes a lot of sense, the guys he drafted all started to contribute, even Pickett and Tyson, recently.
It would be awful to have a trigger happy Nico Harrison type in his place, desperate to go *all in*. || Booth seems to be doing the same shit at a GM level that Jokic gets killed for on the court lol. Every time Jokic force feeds a shooter in a slump people used to pile on, “he needs to just own the ball and score instead”, and then it worked because the players had confidence and chemistry (and trust) when it mattered.

Optimistic it may be, but Booth forcing the young players to grow into what we need strikes me as more likely than trying to just buy a new roster or massively overpaying the Bruce Browns and KCPs of the world (still love you two). The finances are just tough, and it’s frankly a miracle we got Russ’s second coming like we have for the price we paid. || I don't know if I would blame Booth for letting KCP walk. Keeping KCP would make the Nuggets a 2nd apron team, and I don't believe a decision like this is Booth's call to make. I don't have an issue with overpaying to keep Murray and AG.

Yeah, a lot of bad decisions here. || I had no idea that his contract expired next season. As a Jokic fan this is music to my ears. I really hope the team does the right thing and move on from him.

He's the one who got them into this hole, he shouldn't be expected to get them out of it. His public comments also doesn't give a lot of confidence and it doesn't seem like he's stopping that anytime soon. || I honestly prefer this core to let them ball out and try again I don’t think there was a realistic trade that could’ve happened that would’ve made us happy the only thing I was thinking is maybe try to get Kevin Durant? I just like keeping our homegrown guys our chip window is still open let’s go get it || The whole Reggie and Zeke situation was a disaster. The BB, CB and KCP pickup earns a lot of goodwill, though. For years, everyone was clamoring for 3&D guys on the wings to complement Joker and Calvin delivered in triplicate. Russ is suggested to have been a Nikola move. Signing Murray and AG and trading KCP were moves that had to be made. The old young draft picks have been meh, but I am encouraged that Pickett is showing promise now but I am a Trey fan moreso than Pickett.

I don't worry too much about lack of FA activity. That has never been in Denver's viable options without overpay. His drafts have been ok - he's no Presti, but not many are.

In all, I wouldn't be upset either way, but if you are going to replace him, it's for an obvious upgrade. Change just to have a different person making decisions isn't always a change for the better. || Does Denver have a singular $10M+/yr liability contract?

Has Booth made any suspect trades of current value contracts for shit value ones?

Are the Nuggets in a rebuild? 

Have a simple majority of the rookies drafted since ‘22 been complete shit?

No?

Then Booth is already better than 3/4 of NBA GMs.  He may not be swinging for the fences, but when you’ve got a proven championship-level roster, you don’t need to. || 3 2nds to move up 6 spots*

Also 3 2nds for Thomas Bryant*

His drafting has been slightly above average overall.

The willingness to throw away 2nds is an issue that hurts around the margins which you see with the roughness of this bench unit

The player options also hurt around the margins too.

The Murray contract seems like the biggest mistake

Last mistake I’d call out is he has barely even attempted to find a backup center. Will use a roster spot on Deandre Jordan and not try to find a competent backup. || Zeke Nnaji’s 4/32, and Dario Saric MLE were horrendous, but I think all the other moves have been good to great. Every draft pick except for Hunter Tyson has passed Moach’s sink or swim minutes. Westbrook signing is looking like a steal, DJ is productive on vet minimum. Jamal is starting to come back and be productive now.

Honestly, other than Nnaji’s and Saric’s awful contracts, it’s been pretty good ||  I'm not saying they should or should not move on from Booth. 

Do you think that Chris Boucher or Jonas Valanciunias moves the needle in any meaningful way? || So what are the Nuggets supposed to do? Not that I agree with every decision, but teams like the Nuggets have free agency and trade problems as players don't want to go there similar to Utah or New Orleans.


Teams like this there only shot is to draft good players and try to find diamonds on free agency and it has a low batting average. They hit with most choices in 2022 and resulted in a ship so he's doing something right,  but the ceiling is low with this style of player management.


These teams have to draft very well to be consistently good. || The way in which he got rid of Reggie's contract I feel is gross negligence when every front office saw the new value of 2nd round picks. Then he repeated the same player option mistake with Saric immediately. || The Zeke contract was incredibly egregious in both process and result, and really hamstrung the team.

Reggie was fine. Giving him a player option and then using 3 2nds to salary dump him, not so much. The same mistake was repeated with Dario. He is another MLE signing they will have to salary dump this off-season.

Picket and Tyson on guaranteed deals, likely a little more than you think. That's been 2 deadish rosters spots for 2 years, and makes including them in a trade difficult.

Russ-great singing.

Holmes unlucky, but maybe you want to bring in a vet since you already have 5 rookie scale contracts on the team. That's a lot of young players on a team trying to contend. || The player option is also from bruce brown's contract.  He signed a 1 year + 1 year player option and got paid and left after the title.  The player options for the lower end contracts have been killing the nuggets || yeah what is this? MPJ just had a couple great games not getting fair trade from him with injuries, hope is he is healthy for playoffs.  Murray, if he gets back to his playoff form for the playoffs it's worth it.  he had one bad playoffs where he was injured and playing through it. bruce brown was to resign AG, bruce brown and KCP have both been playing pretty bad compared to their contract if i'm not mistaken.  so a couple of bad not big salary cap contracts in hunter,dario, jeff green and justin holiday arn't big ohhh you let them leave players.  getting braun and pwat are both good. strawther has been pretty good for us so far and trading a 2029 for strawther in jokics prime I think is fine. || U dont pay jamal 50 plus million. No one would have || Most other teams wouldn’t have gave Jamal that contract. He looked bad after his injury last year, terrible in the Olympics, it would have been very fair to wait, especially in this 2nd apron era. Right now it’s one of the worst contracts in the league. || I was an advocate of overpaying to resign KCP, because I thought Denver didn't gain any flexibility by letting him walk, which has been born out. I won't die on that hill, but I will die on the hill that not being able to work a sign and trade or replacing his skill set was a mistake.

The new CBA hurt Denver, but the front office has not handled it well. They have essentially stuck themselves by paying players who can't play and giving them guaranteed deals or player options. || Seriously we’re not even bad or out of contention. AG being hurt at the start of the season caused a hard dip, plus Russ getting used to the lineup, but we’re genuinely looking good and any night Jamal high-rolls we look unstoppable. Idk how some people look at the Nuggets and see the dumpster fire it seems like they see. || > Denver has one of the best starting 5 in the NBA.

No we don't... || Even Jalen Pickett seems promising. All of Booth’s pick has been pretty good considering they were all late 1sts or early 2nds || Plus AG is healthy, MPJ is on a tear, and Jamal at least still has the high ceiling we need to win it all. Russ is an immaculate pickup, and the kids are alright (as you mentioned). This doomer shit is frankly old, it was always wrong but now it’s out-of-date too. || Exactly. People beating the horse of the nuggets bench being bad haven’t been watching this year. Russ has been great and Strawther and Watson have really grown from last year. || Watson and Strwather might be the players Denver needs in 2 or 3 years, but they need them to be those players now. || Second round picks are absolute garbage if you're one of the top teams in the NBA. It's so close to signing an undrafted player it's effectively meaningless.

Giving up second round picks that will have little to no value isn't hamstringing the team. || Isn't there something about not being able to get traded if you have 2 year contract with a player option on then next year? Might be giving these guys assurances they wont get shipped during their time on the team",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.056,0.818,0.127,0.91,0.132,0.711,0.158,0.9973
Jalen Brunson,"""Jalen Brunson"" OR ""Jalen"" OR ""Jalen Dime"" OR ""Brunson""",2025-02-23,nbadiscussion,1iw5w7i,It is remarkable how many of the league's very best defenders are young players on rookie contracts,"Examples (in no particular order)

- Victor Wembanyama
- Ausar Thompson
- Amen Thompson
- Toumani Camara
- Chet Holmgren
- Jalen Williams
- Evan Mobley
- Jalen Suggs
- Dyson Daniels 
- Dereck Lively
- Tari Eason
- Walker Kessler

Wemby is the obvious headliner and the list is otherwise in no particular order but you could exclude him as an outlier and still have a roster full of All Defense caliber players.

Some of these guys have gotten big extensions already but are still on their rookie scale contracts this season. The depth continues with Banchero, Wagner, Podz, AJ Green, Kel'el Ware, Christian Braun, Ryan Dunn, and more guys who are all above average and have shown they can supplement a good defensive team/scheme and not be a weak link and in some cases be the primary stopper. If Max Christie had been a first round pick, he'd still be on a rookie contract this year.

There's some conventional wisdom that says young players are bad at defense but I've always thought using that adage was a pretty lazy way of projecting players and is increasingly untrue. It applies better to rookies but most of these guys were fine or good as rookies and have continued to improve. 

It also speaks to just the depth of defensive talent the league has as a whole because there are lots of mid career and veteran players who are good defenders and still having good years. This is not claiming every one of these young players is better than the older guard but I think they should be challenging the perception that young players will be bad on defense by default.",186,58,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iw5w7i/it_is_remarkable_how_many_of_the_leagues_very/,2025-02-23 03:51:26,"it’s wild how so many of these rookies and sophomores are already defensive anchors. part of it might be modern training and scouting—these guys come into the league more nba-ready than ever. plus, positions are more fluid, so being a versatile defender is more valuable and gets developed early. the old “rookies are bad at defense” idea doesn’t hold up when you see players like wemby, chet, or ausar thompson impacting games on that end right away. definitely feels like a new wave of young stoppers is here. || Just a thought but is this due to younger players having more volatile minutes and smaller roles so trying hard on the defensive end is very important for them to stay on the court unlike older guys who can take possessions off. But yeah regardless some potential generational defenders in the league right now || This is actually a strong testament to just how difficult it is to guard in today’s NBA.

The vast majority of young players can’t get and/or stay on the floor if they’re clear negatives on defense. That wasn’t true 10 years ago, let alone dating back to prior eras (mid-2000s and 90s, specifically) the masses love and always insist defense was more important.

Now, if you can’t defend, you’re very likely not playing in high-level NBA games. 

For some of these guys in particular, helps that they’re physical freaks. But there’s also just no way elite playmaking prospects like Amen and Ausar Thompson, for instance, are as instantly committed as they are defensively if they came up 10+ years ago. 

The offensive explosion has resulted in a generation of players knowing they *must* defend. Pretty sweet. || Nah, look at Mikal Bridges and Jaden Mcdaniels, they were defensive savant seasons ago but are now barely trying on defense. Those young guns are just trying to get paid and secure their starting spots. || Young players still trying to make a name for themselves just putting in more effort. When you are as physically gifted as the average NBA player defense really just comes down to effort || Defense in the nba has slowly gone from individual manning up to defending in space primarily. The former rewards strength and ‘craftiness’ more which tends to lean towards veterans, while the latter requires more quickness and athleticism which tends to lead towards younger players. || I think Donovan Clingan, Bilal Coulibaly, and Jeremy Sochan are close to all-defensive caliber as well. Just need slightly better situations to get the recognition

Definitely seems like defense is more of a young man’s game right now || Jaylen Wells is rookie right now. He is on the 2nd best team in the west and guards the other team’s best player every night. || I mean defence is primarily effort and athleticism. Easier to be super athletic and less affected by injuries in your early 20s. combine that with looking to find a place for yourself in the league, and being a defensive menace for a lot of these super athletic guys without a knock down shot becomes the best path to sustained success in the NBA. || Kel’el Ware isn’t a good defender.

But I think what you’re seeing is that perimeter defense is a young man’s game.  Any contact is a foul now, so perimeter defense is all about beating offensive players to the spot and having length to disrupt.  Athletic peak for NBA players is 22-25. || The fact you don't list Franz Wagner when he's a statistically better defender than most of these guys is criminal. || Woah your telling me the players that haven’t secured that generation bag yet are trying hard on defense? || Defense is 90% effort. Most guys in the league are physically gifted demons so almost everyone is capable of being a good-great defender. It’s no surprise the young guys give more effort defensively. || Defense is a combination of effort and athletesism.
Both are greater for younger players, especially  effort as they need to prove themselves while still having the stamina to play both ways || I was thinking this same point but couldn’t quite put it into words so good job. I’m not sure it’s entirely about age or contract but I’m leaning that way. Could be that teams are looking for guys specifically based off their defensive abilities more now since it’s such a valuable commodity hoping their offense comes around. Or once they get paid they let the rookies do the heavy lifting because I get paid the big bucks to score you rookie scum 😁 jk. Idk but wish my team had an elite defensive minded big dammit!! || > There's some conventional wisdom that says young players are bad at defense but I've always thought using that adage was a pretty lazy way of projecting players and is increasingly untrue.

Young players have the athleticism and stamina to be tireless defenders, but not necessarily the IQ and experience. As they get older and accrue more mileage, the IQ and experience improves, but the athleticism slowly saps. The IQ and experience part of the equation - and thus the ideal meeting point of the two - is probably just coming on sooner now than it used to due to more development brainpower in (most) organizations. Guys coming with more and more AAU polish probably doesn't hurt either.

(I also think mainstream defensive reputation and recognition tends to lag behind actual performance.) || The best defenders this season have arguable been all 3 of Wemby, Chet and Evan Mobley which is insane, when has the arguable top 3 defenders consisted of only players younger than 25 || Keon Ellis 

It is multi factor 

1. Teams/ an individual player has only so much effect on defense. 

2. Defense is still evolving so even scouts and organization have a harder time recognizing good defenders in comparison to good offensive players 

3. Defensive stats are limited and box score defensive stats are very limited in being predictive of a great NBA defender compared to box score offensive stats do translate 

For example age height-to-position and wingspan are better indicators of a future good nba defender than steals in college || Gonna be very interesting when they start to spread out over the league as teams like OKC aren’t going to be able to afford to keep them || I think it’s a combo of the top young players being valued and trained for modern defense, and them simply trying harder. 

No shade to stars, but in the regular season, a rookie playing for his first big contract on 20 mins a night is gunna play harder defense and risk/hurt their body way more than LeBron playing 40 mins a night. || I think a big part of it is also the changes in the game. It's so much faster now and everyone's sprinting to the 3 point line. 

Having a guy who can lock down one player like Tony Allen used to be is not really worth it any more. If that guy can't also hit 3s being able to lock down the other teams best player doesn't provide the value it used to. 

The games also so fast now that a lot of those older 3 and D guys get phased out much earlier. || No it’s that younger players 

are going to be more athletic altogether especially across an 82 game season night to night 

Great defense in todays nba is about being able to quickly rotate to where the ball is moving and having a great wingspan to smother offensive players

He mentioned growing up with everyone wanting to get buckets. He would ask himself, “who’s gonna stop them?” || Defense today is more lackluster than ever. I have no idea where these takes come from.

Since December 21, they have the leagues 4th best record and boast a top 10 offense and top 5 defense. Cade Cunningham is averaging 27-5-9 in that stretch, and Ausar Thompson is starting and looking like one of the best defensive players in the league. New coach JB Bickerstaff has a system that seems to predicate a lot around pace, running in transition, Cade P&Rs, and screens. Detroit over the entire season is 5th in transition possessions and number 1 in points off screens in the league, a stat that the Warriors have dominated over their dynastic run. Detroit has eliminated the Killian Hayes minutes and allowed Cade to run the point full time and let him make decisions out of the P&R. 

They've also (finally) embraced having 4 shooters + 1 rim running center on the court. Before they had Isaiah Stewart and Jalen Duren out there playing together, now Tobias Harris has come in and improved floor spacing for Cade to operate, as well as Malik Beasley and Tim Hardaway Jr also vastly improving their floor spacing compared to previously.

THJ, Malik Beasley, Tobias Harris - these 3 add veteran leadership as well as spacing.

- Cade Cunningham has improved drastically. the added spacing has predictably helped him a lot and he's improved in basically every aspect of his game.

- Ausar Thompson is finally healthy and he's one of the best defensive players in the league.

- JB Bickerstaff has done an incredible job instilling a defense-first mindset and had helped players like Jalen Duren and Jaden Ivey become serviceable on that end of the floor

- they're clearly having fun and love playing together || They play hard (Bickerstaff might not be the coach of the year but going from Monty to him is one of the biggest year-to-year coaching improvements in league history) and are the right amount of young where they’re not clueless but also don’t have to rest a bunch of players every other game. 

The gap between 15 and 40 wins in the NBA really isn’t that enormous where if things start to go south teams just pack it up and start trying to lose while playing dudes who won’t be on the roster the following year. || Beaseley is low-key having a superb season (maybe he gets some attention as 6 Man of the Year? I don't know). He's an offball shooting threat who moves really well, and that's exactly the sort of player you want on the other end of a Cade Cunningham pass. Beaseley has excellent efficiency even at the high volume of shots he takes.

The Pistons have also had a much healthier season than last year. Their centers have played nearly every game, and the only notable absences are Ivey and Thompson at the start of the season.

Cade has an expanded bag of tricks. His handle has a lot more combos, and he's turned into a strong post player. He does what Luka does: backing a shorter guard to the post, and using his size to get the shot off. This season he's developed a hook shot that's very reliable. || I'm a Pistons fan and I'm enjoying their improvements, no doubt. Bumped up their 3P% by 2% from last year. Decreased their opponent FG% by 3%. They're also forcing 3 more TOs per game. This is due to both the increase in talent level, natural improvement, and a coach who actually cares about his job.

ALL THAT BEING SAID, they have dodged a lot of bullets recently. Played the Spurs without Wemby, Clippers without Kawahi, Celtics without Brown. || [removed] || Someone outside Detroit questioning if the Pistons are good is more than I've seen in years. I officially deem this season a success. || It's all off the backs of their defense. They're top 11 in defense right now and Duren has improved a ton on that end. || [removed] || Everywhere Tim Hardaway Jr goes, they make the playoffs, Tim is HIM.

On a more serious note, from what I’ve watched them play, they are a team with very low/less ego, they don’t have the “this is my team and this is my time” guy but we know it’s Cade team BUT Cade is a very unselfish player, he’s very smart and seems like he’s always in-control of his emotions(not jacking up shots when mad, not trying to be a hero) everyone on that team knows their roles just a prime example of “everything is clicking”

Cade turns the ball over A LOT but nobody talks about it because they’re winning, what I’m trying to say is statistically, Cade is playing incredibly well but it’s nothing we haven’t seen before, it’s just a total team effort with Cade as a smart decision maker. || Grew up in Michigan, huge pistons fan. 

Wife is a warriors fan, so I got to enjoy watching that team play. Like, literally, play, they seem to have fun out there.  Pistons have a similar vibe going lately.

I currently live in Phoenix. The fan base here, even with the new owner, have ZERO hope their team is going anywhere. I'm making converts to DEEEEE TROIT BASKET BALLLLL in the valley of the sun. || Adding onto other points made in this thread:

- As a Pistons fan, I don’t think other fans realize exactly how bad Monty and Weaver were for us. Half our rotation isn’t even in the league (or barely getting minutes), so just simply cutting those guys was addition by subtraction. 

- Vet presence has been huge and honestly they’ve been a lot better than expected. Beasley and Tobias especially have been amazing in their roles. THJ as well. We also just got Dennis Schroeder who will be huge for the playoffs. All 4 of these guys are on solid contracts too. 


- Ron Holland was a solid pick. Hes super young and has a lot of room to grow but I think he’ll be a solid role player in this league. Isaiah Stewart has been very solid defensively. 


- Cade’s growth has been amazing but I think people overlook his defensive abilities as well. I honestly think he’s a top 10 player in this league. Also Ausar and Duren have improved a ton since last year. || To me as a Pistons fan who watches every game the biggest difference is the culture change that has occurred within the entire organization from the hiring,  of Detroit's new President of Basketball Operations Trajan Langdon. 

He has a well thought out plan. He has respect, integrity, intelligence, experience and impeccable professionalism. He expects to be successful.


Imo, he has done everything perfectly since being hired; EXCEPT for drafting Ron Holland instead of Matas Buzelis who I feel will be a star.  love his height, athleticism, basketball IQ, feel for the game, wiggle, ballhandling, court vision, instincts, finishing, versatility and outside shooting potential. || They aren't playing Killian Hayes starter minutes this year. 

They have vets to supplement and support young guys. 

JB didn't only come because he was offered a stupid amount of money. His heart is in the job unlike Monty. 


Duren is coming along 


Cade is ascending to a legit number 1 and staying healthy. Spacing has unsurprisingly made him more efficient. || cade has been developing and they’re finally rubbing things through him every play. he’s got shooters around him and duren has turned it up big time || [removed] || What would you say is the teams identity or culture? I think it’s still developing. There’s some semblance of hard nose toughness with stew and Duren. Holland has scrapped a little. There’s some underdog mentality. But im excited to see how it develops as expectations increase and they face harder challenges.

Time will tell on the draft. I’ve liked Holland in spurts too. And I think he contributes to a hustle grind culture that might be developing. || Ausar is a way better team player than Ivey, who is a sieve and turnover machine. || I enjoy watching how hard they play. Youthful and full of passion, seem to have no egos, and they play hard D || One of the main reasons is getting rid off Monty Williams. That guy doesn't know how to coach team in development process. He doesn't have the spine for it || Pistons also rebound the fuck out of the ball — 51.7% overall ranks fourth in league, then they’re fifth in defensive rebounding rate and eighth offensively.

I’m still not a huge believer in Jalen Duren as type of center you need to win at highest level. Just don’t think he has instincts+timing needed to become top-tier rim defender, despite improvements this season.

But my god is he a monster rebounder. Massive frame, long arms, quick leaper, always physical, soft hands — all the attributes that make Duren an elite finisher are even more devastating on the glass.

Hope he exceeds my expectations on D. Really fun player, especially next to a passer like Cade. || Yep, and they're definitely playoff bound. The biggest surprise in the NBA and looks like their coach should win Cosch of the Year! Them and Indiana are the most under the radar teams in the east || I love seeing Beasley and Harris find the right fit. Detroit just out plays the other team every time I watch them play.

Almost 10 attempts from three and 42.5% is legit one of the great shooting seasons of all time. Someone posted that this volume and efficiency was only accomplished a few other seasons, all by curry. It also tracks with the eye test, the offense is not a well oiled machine. They get bailed out of possessions by Cade wiggling and muscling his way to his spots and by Malik dropping pretty ridiculous buckets at the start of end of the shot clock. That’s the set offense.

* Philadelphia - Embiid might never be the same and he's eating up 50M in cap. They can only hope he either miraculously returns or they medically force him to retire so the cap hit is forgiven.
* Phoenix - No control of FRP through 2031. At least KD might recoup an asset, maybe even from Houston?

Some teams I'm not mentioning:

* Atlanta - The East is weak enough they could make a run. I think Jalen Johnson coming back next year will be a big boost.

Tough blow to the Knicks’ organization and fans after the injury to *the Captain*.

Brunson turned his ankle in overtime while playing against the scorching hot Lakers.

Brunson was having a great game (39 points and 10 assists) culminated by another all-star season.

The injury looks pretty severe, Knicks may be without their franchise player for quite some time.

#Is the season over for the 3rd seed in the East?

No. Quite the contrary - the Knicks have a solid cushion as the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference with 20 games left in the regular season.

This should give more opportunities and playing time to players like Deuce McBride and Cam Payne.

Hopefully, rookie Tyler Kolek will also get a chance from Coach Thibs to showcase his playmaking and shooting in this Brunsonless stretch.

#Better Defensively

Knicks will have to lean more on the defensive side of the ball without the offensive fire power of Brunson. Robinson & Towns will have to protect the rim even more while Hart, Bridges and OG secure the perimeter.

Now they will have to lean much more into KAT, but the problem is the team is built with shooters and KAT, while amazing at scoring, isn’t a playmaker to really set guys like OG and Bridges up.

Deuce has the biggest chance to step up, he’s been pretty inconsistent in his career so it’s not a great place to be for a contender. Some nights he’s on, most nights he’s off. Cam Payne a proven vet with an almost Lou Will spark- plug type of energy - but he isn’t going to be stopping anyone on defense and has also been a fairly inconsistent player his whole career.

I really call into question idea of Brunson-less Knicks leaning into defense - yes Robinson can be a paint beast but seems like he has the durability of a wet newspaper and KAT has never been a plus defender either. OG and Bridges are good not great, not going to be stopping guys like Dame, Hali, Tatum, etc.

This is the danger of overplaying starters all season in a relatively heliocentric offense - those starters breaking down come play-offs || [deleted] || Without Brunson they need to run through KAT. is not that rocket science… You will need his confidence back in the playoffs.

The Knicks aren't going anywhere in the playoffs without a healthy Brunson, he's the core cog of their offense and the system won't function at a high level without him despite the other quality players. || Ain’t no way you said more opportunities for Cam Payne. He’s in his 13th season on his 7th team. 

The only way to spin this as a good thing is for the FO to see how much they rely on Brunson. Maybe KAT can find a rhythm. But this is far from a blessing. || > The injury looks pretty severe, 

The amount of armchair doctors that have come out of the woodwork to weigh in on Brunson's ankle is ridiculous. It didn't look great but that often doesn't mean much. We've seen guys roll their ankle like that and miss zero games and we've seen guys with injuries that ""looked"" minor be out for months.

> Hopefully, rookie Tyler Kolek will also get a chance from Coach Thibs 

Haha, good luck with that.

> there’s still a great chance they achieve a homecourt spot in the East

Home court is overrated, I don't like the Knicks chances of even hitting .500 without Brunson, the Bucks are rolling and the Pistons and Pacers have been playing at a 55+ win pace since mid-December. || My thing is that Brunson is a pretty ball-dominant scorer. So even if the other offensive playmakers on the roster do get more confidence in the time that he is gone, the system will go back to Brunson-ball as soon as he is healthy, thus reverting those players back to their roles || chris smoove || No it’s not a blessing, thibs system is just not egalitarian enough to adjust to missing Brunson  || I was thinking the same thing. This team has a serious problem of having to be bailed out by Brunson way too often, and often times the offense still feels very clunky without him on the floor. This could finally force them to figure out how to operate in ways that don’t involve Brunson. || There's about 35 days until the playoffs, Brunson should be able to come back || In case they past 1st round, who would be a better matchup for them?

McBride will play more maybe, but he was already playing || Nothing about this is a blessing.  Playoffs start in 5 weeks and at best that injury is a nasty sprain that could easily be bothering him in the postseason.

Further to it, don't forget who their coach is.  I wouldn't be surprised if the other starters get even more run into the ground with Brunson out.  This could very easily spiral into a repeat of last season, only without the depth the Knicks had last year. || Towns has to make massive changes to his game if the team wants to go somewhere he was non existent yesterday after he picked those two quick fouls.  Mikal has to at least be a quality consistent 18-20 as well. || The thing, for me, is that the Knicks have too many quality players to be so one-dimensional on offense. 

Between Mikhal, OG, and KAT, they should be able to be functional without Jalen. 

Every time I've watched the Knicks (admittedly, not a ton this year), every single crunch-time possession is exactly the same. Ball goes to Jalen at the top with everybody standing around. Screen. He drives or pulls up. 

If one time out of every three or four they did something else - let Mikhal or KAT create something, tried to get the ball to Jalen on the move - the defense would have to work much harder. 

Instead it feels like they're spamming the same play again and again even when the defense has a pretty good handle on it. Jalen is a tough-ass dude, but there's still no reason to send him crashing into the trees every single play. 

That doesn't work against locked-in teams unless your ball handler is on that LeBron/Luka level. Good as he is, Jalen isn't that. 

If the Knicks can figure out a functional offense without Jalen in time for the playoffs, and then not totally abandon it once he comes back, they'll be dangerous. But I just have a hard time seeing them make a deep run if every single crunch time possession is Jalen from the top, as good as he is. || Knicks really should start expanding their rotation. No need for these players to be playing 40 mins a game. 

I would like to see


Bridges 32-35
OG 30-34
Hart 33-36
Towns 30-33
Robinson 10-15

Achiwa 15-20
Mcbride 20-25
Shamet 10-15
Payne 15-20

Hart would take PG responsibilities and let OG have more usage. || Once Brunson left the game last night versus the Lakers, New York looked lost. That is all I need to say lol || At least 2 weeks isn't too bad for a sprained ankle. Knicks are deep enough to sustain. What stood out to me about the injury is how well he was playing. He was locked in. In my mind, there is no way the Lakers would've won if he didn't go down like that towards the end. He would've hit a couple buckets when they needed them. This happened to him in the playoffs last yr, so hopefully it's not a trend because the Knicks are hard to beat when he's locked and loaded. Imagine Luka and him on the Mavs. They'd be an all-time dynasty || 4 game lead with 20 games left and a clicking Giannis and Bucks team behind them is not a comfortable cushion. Especially considering they still meet one more time this season. It’s entirely reasonable for Milwaukee to catch them for the 3rd seed. New York also has a rough schedule with games @LAC, @GSW, @MIL, @CLE, and two more games with Boston and Cleveland at home. || The Knicks have the tools to still be a very effective offense even without Brunson. 

The only problem is Thibs is the coach. He has zero idea how to run a modern NBA offense. No off ball screens, no ball movement, just clunky “everyone just stand around as we watch the ball handler” type AAU offense. || It seems like the whole system is just Brunson doing everything he can to get the team to score || Besides Brunson, the only player whose team offense revolves around them more that I can think of is Jokic. Both these teams look incredibly awkward without their stars on the court. || KAT completely disappeared for 10+ mins of regulation. At times I forgot he was even out there. The lakers don’t have AD anymore he should have been cooking. They live and die with Brunson || Pretty much every Thibs led offense || Agreed. This is no blessing in disguise, it just sucks.
Hopefully it’s not too serious, but that ankle roll looked nasty || Its tough saying that on a 1 game sample when we've seen this team with the same lineup, putting up 140+ on a regular basis. The biggest difference last night was Kat not being able to buy a shot and Bridges being MIA for most of the game on offense. The Kat part isn't concerning cause he just came back from taking personal time off, so I assume he's got shit he's dealing with at home, and his head wasn't in it. Bridges is concerning though, Brunson wasn't even looking to his side whenever he needed to move the ball, everything was going the other way to OG who has no business being the second option on offense with that lineup",0.282,0.529,0.188,-0.1531,0.058,0.77,0.171,0.9722,0.114,0.751,0.135,0.9931
