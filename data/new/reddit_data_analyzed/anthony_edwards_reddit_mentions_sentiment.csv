Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2024-11-07,nbadiscussion,1gmto1d,If consistency was a NBA player that player would be Domantas Sabonis  ,"Since being acquired by the Sacramento Kings on February 8, 2022 from the Indiana Pacers, Domantas Sabonis has been the main man in the middle and the main reason and focal point for the resurgence of the Kings franchise. Mr. Consistent is what I call Sabonis from his days in Indiana as you could see the steady improvement each year and always had a “motor” on both the offense and defensive end of the floor. Domantas rarely misses games, and is reliable and durable for the most part. So far this season, Sabonis has played in all 8 of the Kings games this year and has a PER of 24.86 which ranks him #3 league wide for PF (power forward) position.

 

**The Sabonis lineage – Ultimate Rebounders**   

Domantas was never labeled a “star” player but coming from great lineage could propel an athlete to even greater heights. Since being drafted into the NBA in 2016 Sabonis has been allowed to grow in the Association first with small market franchises Oklahoma and Indiana, and now with the Kings. The Sabonis name is legendary within basketball circles, especially in Europe and later on in North America for revolutionizing the big man position. From father to son, the Sabonis name and game are very similar with great touch around the basket, can play and guard on the perimeter, and has a knack for rebounding and knowing where the ball is going to be when a shot goes up. Arvydas has taught his son well, and also led the NBA in rebounding twice along with being a multi time all star and all NBA performer during his HOF basketball career. This makes all the sense in the world, as Domantas has already led the NBA in rebounding in back to back seasons (2022-2023 & 2023 – 2024) and is poised to do the same this year (#2 in NBA in rebounding with 13.1 reb/game).  

 

**Sabonis > AD & BAM???**

When you stack up Demontas Sabonis game with the rest of his all star all NBA peers you start to notice that Sabonis is right there with the Anthony Davis’s and Bam Adebayo of the world. Especially if we are comparing the last few seasons, an argument can be made that Sabonis has been better than those two but due to a lack of team success Sabonis rarely gets mentioned with the likes of Bam and AD. Statistically Anthony Davis vs Domantas Sabonis is a master class on how to play the modern NBA big position with both players showing you their versatility in the paint and on the perimeter along with their defensive skill set and rebounding prowess. For the amount of hype that AD gets from NBA media and playing for the Lakers, Domontas Sabonis has been as consistent with steady numbers, overall play along with durability at the power forward position than AD and Bam but without the flash.",174,35,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1gmto1d/if_consistency_was_a_nba_player_that_player_would/,2024-11-08 16:30:42,"Since this seems to be formatted with analytic intent, I will give feedback to that end.

When writing a post like this, the focus should always be ""what am I adding to the conversation?"" In order to do that, you need to establish what the conversation is, and stake out the point where you're bringing something new.

So here's what this sub can (optimistically) be expected to know about Sabonis, son of Sabonis. Conventional wisdom on Sabonis does not compare him to AD or Bam, two-way PF/C hybrids mixing rim protection, switchability, finishing prowess, and self-created scoring. Sabonis is Jokic lite: an offensively oriented playmaking center whose strengths are rebounding, passing, and traditional interior play, and whose main perceived challenge is holding up defensively.

Since coming to the Kings for Haliburton in the biggest win-win trade in recent memory (cemented by Sabonis' extension), Sabonis and Fox have led the Kings to two winning seasons and their first playoff bid in nearly two decades, a heated series with the Warriors that featured Draymond Green stomping on Sabonis' chest and Sabonis struggling to create offense when left open at the elbow, highlighting his deficit of shooting touch compared (perhaps unfairly) to Jokic and the Kings core's spacing issues. 

Now that we know the baseline perception of Sabonis, we can think about what could be added.

* Have any of these factors changed significantly? How is Sabonis' midrange game looking this season? Is he surprising in defensive metrics the way Jokic did en route to banishing criticisms of his defense and winning a title? Are Sabonis' strengths even more unstoppable than before?
* Can we dig deeper into the tape or the metrics to understand the conventional wisdom on Sabonis in more depth?
* Is there a larger conversation to have about the team context? Are the Kings doing anything surprising yet? How does this year's crop of role players fit in with Sabonis' game? How about their new veteran DeRozan? What would the Kings need to do with their roster to maximize their chances with Sabonis?

After asking myself these questions, I think my conclusion would be that there isn't much to say about Sabonis at the moment. But I haven't looked at the Kings in detail since their playoff series, so I can't say I'd have caught any generally overlooked developments.

What I *can* say is that ""Sabonis rebounds"" is not very interesting, while ""Sabonis has arguably been better than AD/Bam over the last few seasons"" is an awkward comparison which you don't elaborate on. (Also, the comparison frankly *doesn't* favor Sabonis in at least AD's case - probably Bam's too, accounting for playoffs.) Recapitulating the conventional knowledge about a player in order to rate them against other players at the surface level is unlikely to generate interesting insights. || C’mon man. They broke their playoff drought two years ago. Had an epic series against the Warriors where Draymond stomped on Sabonis. It makes it hard to take the rest of the post seriously after that big of an omission. || He may be better than Bam Adebayo, but he has never been and I don’t think he will be better than Anthony Davis. I won't be a bad fan and say he's trash, because he definitely deserve his flowers, but I'm not a big fan of his game. It’s a weird type of player to build around. || U can’t just omit a huge part of the game. Sabonis a better offensive player than bam and on par w ad.

But ad and bam r both dpoy candidates year after year while Sabonis is below avg to avg defender. This is especially important as the center position is the most imoortant position to be good defensively. It’s large reason why the Knicks r struggling rn and why most nba finals teams have a rly good defensive center. || I would whole heartedly agree if you added ""in the regular season""  Night to night during the regular season he is super consistent.  It's when he is put in a 7 game series that teams begin to figure him out and scheme around his weaknesses. || He not close to ad but he might be better than bam. The shit I been seeing from bam is atrocious || He’s not better than bam or ad. We have to stop ignoring the defensive side of basketball. Bam and AD are some of the most versatile and impactful defenders in the league no debate.  That value has been evident when their respective teams go on deep playoff runs. ( bam against bucks and NYC in 23) ( AD vs Memphis and warriors 23) Sabonis is a good player no hate but let’s slow down || You mentioned he's greater than AD and Bam. You didn't mention any wings or guards. 

If rebounding is a stat you'd like to highlight, then Drummond should be known as the most consistent player of the over the past 15 years. 

[Reference ](https://craftednba.com/player-traits/consistency) || [removed] || Sabonis is a regular season player. He has and will continue to struggle in the playoffs due to his terrible defense and way he tries to use his strength on offense. Not worth the money he’s paid IMO if a team has aspirations to make noise in the playoffs. || He cant defend though. His numbers always seem slightly empty because of this || I really hope the kings get him some inside help, Alex Len has been helpful but isn’t going to provide enough minutes to really provide any relief from Sabonis being left alone vs all of the opposing bigs for the majority of each game. I’m really interested to see how he does with more room to maneuver and rotate to really flex his offensive and facilitation potential. It might also help him not get punched in the face 3-4 times a game. || Every single day somebody posts some absurd pro Sabonis take and then months in to the season kings and Sabonis fans come out of the woodwork to whine about Sabonis being overhated. This cycle is so obnoxious || Sabonis is a very consistent player, very good rebounder and even better passer, but a somewhat average shooter from midrange at best. I remember when Golden State eliminated them that they were sagging off in defense and daring him to shoot, which is never a good sign. 

That being said, there is no way in hell he's as good as AD. Not offensively, not defensively. He's a better creator, but that's about it. He can give you 15-20 and 10, not 30+ and 15+ like AD. The Lakers' past few seasons failures have led people to really underestimate AD, it seems. || As long as SGA plays in the NBA or at least leads OKC, Domantas can’t be Mr. Consistent, plain and simple. || Sabonis is not a star player I would want to have in the playoffs compared to his peers.

Similar to Westbrook in his prime vs. Chris Paul. Russell may have an MVP and crazy triple double stat lines but when it comes to winning important ball games, I’d stick it out with players that understand how to win. || You could have just said ""Sabonis over AD and Bam is crazy ngl"" || Typo you are right trying to get to the edit button lol || Yeah Sabonis might be better than bam in terms of talent or something, but I would much much rather have bam on my team. Sabonis’s defense messes up the whole rest of the roster construction. || He’s not offensively on par w AD even w his playmaking || Sabonis has been legitimately good on defense since last season, just because he doesn’t put up big block/steal numbers doesn’t mean he’s not solid on D. Of course he’s nowhere near the elite defensive prowess of AD/Bam/Gobert, but he always seems to be in the right position, bangs in the post effectively against guys like Jokic/AD, and is surprisingly agile on the perimeter for a guy his size. Last year he even locked up Curry on 2 consecutive possessions after getting switched onto him in crunch time, poking the ball away twice and forcing a clutch turnover that eventually led to a Kings victory. If you watch nearly every Kings game, you’ll find out that being big and white with a below average wingspan ≠ automatically poor defender

AD > Sabonis > Bam || Please keep your comments civil. This is a subreddit for thoughtful discussion and debate, not aggressive and argumentative content. || The Kings FO has a (sa)boner for small guards while neglecting the frontcourt lmao

There's a logjam at the guard positions (including their draft pick, Devin Carter, who's injured, and they passed on (among others) Kel'el Ware, Dalton Knecht, Tristan Da Silva, Yves Missi, Ryan Dunn, Bobi Klintman and Jaylen Wells to pick him), while the front court is still giving regular minutes to end-of-the-bench caliber players like Trey Lyles and Doug McDermott || Don’t think that really applies to Chris Paul either. Prime Chris Paul never even made it to the WCF. He did later when he played with Harden and then the Finals with Booker and the Suns, but Westbrook did that too with KD before his prime.  

I think Chris Paul is the better all time PG and better floor raiser for the regular season but not sure this is even an example that makes sense. Plus Sabonis is a pretty good floor raiser himself.  || I wouldn't have bothered commenting if that was all I wanted to say. || And he disappears in the playoffs and refuses to shoot to space the floor. Hopefully he plays better but I think it’s just who he is a regular season stat padder (hate me all you want, look at his playoff numbers and get back to me) || I never use blocks and steal counting to evaluate good or bad defence because a lot of defensive ability are things that cannot be kept track off with advanced stats or box score. Sabonis has consistently struggle in the playoffs due to his defensive issues. I think for the center position it’s very detrimental when the 5 man is such a weak point. I haven’t watched every kings regular season game so maybe I’ll have to keep my eye on them next few weeks and  create a reevaluation of my position. || Chris Paul was pretty great in every playoff series  he just didn't have a top 100 all time team mate till he was past his prime. I feel given his rosters his teams always performed well in the playoffs. || Yeah, I mean he’s definitely not a *great* defender due to his lack of rim protection, but he more than holds his own out there with everything else he does do well, and he’s definitely not a “weak point” — there’s no way the Kings would be an above-average defensive team overall (14th in DRtg last season, 11th so far this season) if Sabonis, who plays 37 minutes per game as the Kings’ only active big on the roster other than Alex Len, didn’t have a positive impact on overall team defense. On top of that, he plays the most of his minutes in a small starting lineup where either Keegan Murray or DeRozan — both natural 3s on defense — has to play up a position to the 4, which puts even more responsibility on Sabonis to play with physicality the entire game and lead the league in rebounds per game like he has the past 2 seasons (rebounding counts as part of defensive impact, too). 

Nothing he does on defense is glamorous (i.e. getting popped in the face several times every game + a lot of communication), but it gets the job done most of the time except against certain matchups. He usually plays well against guys like Davis, Jokic, Bam, etc. who aren’t used to getting bodied by guys who are stronger than they are, but he always seems to struggle with the few bigs in the league who are both bigger and stronger than him, as we saw tonight against Zubac and in previous instances against guys like Valanciunas, Nurkic at times, etc. Regardless, if you do end up watching some upcoming Kings games, you’ll see that even without the ability to erase teammates’ mistakes that elite defensive big men possess, he’s still clearly a net positive on an above-average Kings defense (feels weird to think about the Kings as a good defensive team but they actually kind of are now)",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.015,0.884,0.101,0.9917,0.08,0.753,0.167,0.9996
Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2024-11-08,nbadiscussion,1gnldi2,Anthony Edwards Jump Shooting Leap,"A lot of people seem to be under the impression that Ant's shooting this season is just small sample size theater. I agree that the sample size is not large enough to make conclusions, and I think he is specifically on a 3P heater right now. BUT we are starting to accumulate a decent jump shooting sample size that might be indicative of a leap if we stretch our timeline a bit.


If we go back and take into account Ant's jump shooting (catch and shoot+pull up) through the playoffs and Olympics (including exhibition games) along with his regular season start this year, we start to get a larger sample that might point to a trend.


Caveats:

- I was unable to find stats for his 2PT jump shots in the Olympics. If someone can find that, I will adjust the numbers. The numbers at the end will might be slightly lower once a few more 2PT shots are included. 

- The Olympic 3PT line is shorter, but I don't have the shot data to determine which shots would and would not have been 3s in the NBA. I'm counting all of them as 3s bc I have a narrative to push.

- Ant also did not take a 3 in one game in the olympics so I'm only counting 9 games.


2024 PLAYOFFS JUMP SHOTS (16 games):

2PT: 42/87

3PT: 45/114

219 points on 201 jump shots 


OLYMPICS (9 games):

3PT: 17/41

51 points on 41 jump shots


2024 REGULAR SEASON (9 games):

2PT: 12/29

3PT: 50/104

174 points on 133 jump shots


TOTALS

34 GAMES

444 points on 375 jump shots


So we have a sample size of almost 400 shots spanning 34 games across 7 months where Anthony Edwards has shot...


**1.18 PTS PER JUMP SHOT**


For normies, this would equal 118 points per 100 possessions or a 118 OFFRTG. That would be the 4th best offense in the league last year....

For comparison:

Steph Curry had a 1.14 points per jump shot last regular season

Kevin Durant had a 1.09 points per jump shot last regular season

SGA had a 1.04  points per jump shot last regular season


At 23 years old, Ant is already one of the best rim pressuring guards in the league due to his elite athleticism and first step. So if he also becomes a knock down shooter, I believe he will enter that territory where he is simply unguardable. If you guard the rim, he's pulling up at a good clip. If you guard the shot, he'll blow by you. If you double... well he's still figuring that out.

If this trend ends up being true, a slight playmaking leap within the next few years would pave the path for a truly dominant player to emerge.

Obviously, this is best case scenario and hopeful wishes from a Wolves fan, but let me know what yall think. ",78,45,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1gnldi2/anthony_edwards_jump_shooting_leap/,2024-11-09 17:11:19,"He’s going to keep “lacing that b****” if defenders keep going under. 

I feel like defenses will make adjustments as the season goes on which will decrease both his attempts & possibly his shooting percentage. But his form has shown positive improvement this season so it’s possible we are just seeing an evolution to Ant’s game. || He did shoot .836 from FT last season, which seems to be a good indicator of 3p shooting ability. I think the leap is real. 


Also, when KAT was traded, one has to wonder if Ant thought about what the team would need after losing arguably the best shooting big man in the league and having Gobert and Randle would clog the paint. He may have focused on that aspect of his game a lot more after the trade ( pure conjecture) || He'll cool off some because the current rate is unsustainable, but he's certainly improved.  It's obvious that he's cleaned up his mechanics.  He has better timing between his lift and jump.  He has a lower set point.  He has eliminated most of the negative movement (the ball traveling away from the rim) in his lift.  His shot prep footwork is really clean now as well. || Most the comments will be (some already) from geniuses saying he won’t sustain 50% from 3 which isn’t the point of your post. || Like the post and interesting comments. Only thing I'm gonna comment on from the OP is that while his playmaking and getting off of doubles is still a work in progress, as a fellow Wolves fan who has watched every game I have seen a vast improvement there as well. He seems to be reading defenses better, getting rid of the ball sooner when doubles come, and passing has improved. He can finally throw some lobs! If he focuses on that even more this off-season and takes *another* leap...I can't even comprehend. 🤯 || it's a good sign but as a career 36% 3P shooter i'm skeptical this rate is sustainable. but even a 2-3 percentage point increase would be substantial for helping the wolves win || This kind of run really highlights how insane Stephs 15-16 season was.

Stephs season was essentially Ant's 9 game run for the entire season. Just shooting 45% instead of 48%.

I hope Ant keeps letting it fly. || One thing noticeable with Ant this year is he’s shooting more frequently. The wolves definitely need him to be a legit outside threat to make some noise this year since they lost their ace space maker in KAT || he just needs to learn when to take 3s and when to drive and he will become mvp caliber || Last year I felt like too many people tried to turn Ant into MJ during the playoffs. 

This year I think we need more than 34 games to turn this kid into Steph Curry. || Yeah the improvements are clear as day. He’s been putting in the work. Like somebody else said, I’m interested to see how his shot selection and percentages change once the league adjusts to his new ability. That’s when we see how much he truly improved in my opinion. 

Way too early prediction: Looks like he CAN be an elite tough-shot maker if he wants to be, somewhere down the line. || He said he got better at shooting from studying Dame. He’s a student of the game and the sky is the limit. Apart from the playmaking, I think he needs to work on playing the game within the game, knowing when he should drive, when to drive and kick, when to pull-up or step back, etc. it feels like currently he’s not taking full advantage of his insane athleticism. || You’re forgetting his shooting his shot off the court. He’s like 6/6 shooting his wad into influencers || I feel like the rate is unsustainable for Ant as much as the percentages are.    
    
Ant has gone from a .341 3PTAr (9.5 3PTA per 100 possessions) to .562 this year (15.6 3PTA per 100), and significantly lowered his number of mid-range shots (23.9% of Ant's total FGA came between 10FT-3PT line last year, compared to 13.5% so far this year). I think Ant is going to lean back into the mid-range more as the season goes on, especially if the 3s stop falling. || you'd need more than 500 attempts from 3 to have a statistically significant sample but even then his free throw percentage is so poor now that I'm thinking he's improved but definitely not close to the degree he's shown in this limited sample of games so far this year. || He was focusing on it before the trade. He said his off-season focus was catch and shoot threes/off-ball movement and that he observed the vets on team usa and worked w KD and Curry on it. KAT wasn't traded until 2 days before training camp. But - that may have been the catalyst for his decision to shoot this volume. || Thank you lmao. I never said that Ant is Curry, just that we are getting to a sample size where it seems like this isn't just a hot streak || Yeah, he's definitely improved in that department. He would not have made it through the Suns series without being able to beat doubles the way he did. But it's the hyper agressive trapping that Denver and Dallas did to him that he really struggles with. 

Hopefully, now with Randle, we have a dynamic offensive option we can trust to beat the 4 on 3 on the backside || This rate is definitely not sustainable, but as you said, any significant increase with his jump shot would make him so much more dynamic. 

For a player as young as Ant is, 35 games and 400 shots spanning 7 months points to this not just being a hot streak. || I repeat this everytime but if you exclude the games where he played throigh wrist injury, he has shot 40% from 3 since March 2023 across 110 games (playoffs+preseason+olympics).

Also ANT is a career 35% midrange shooter so the 3 point line being shortened should not be against his shooting improving. || I can;t wait till he puts it all together and has that perfect blend of drives, threes and midrange (with some posters in between) 👀 || That is not the point of the post.

The point is that 1.18 pts/shot in 34 games and 400 shots over 7 months is probably a significant enough sample size for us to have some confidence that this isn't simply hot shooting and that Ant has taken a leap as a jump shooter in some capacity.  

I'm not betting that he is a 45% 3P shooter,  but if he ends up being a 39% on 9 attempts and a 45% midrange scorer,  he'll be an insanely dynamic player for a 23 year old. || Yeah he doesn't exactly have that elite court vision that makes it feel like he's manipulating the defense on every possession. As far as olaymaking goes, I think he is capable of getting to an SGA level playmaker which would be huge. 

I don't really agree with your last sentence tho. A lot of hyper athletic players rely on their athleticism too much and don't improve the finer details. This results in them getting injured or falling off at an earlier age. I am happy that Ant is working on the more ""finesse"" or ""skill based"" parts of his game. The pairing and the ability to switch between finesse and overwhelming athleticism create a much higher ceiling and makes him infinitely more dynamic. || No way he keeps that volume up right? || This post isn't about this rate being sustainable. 

I am only making the argument that 1.18pts/shot in 34 games and 400 shots spanning 7 months is starting to point towards this not simply being hot shooting. I'm not saying that he will maintain a semblance of this efficiency,  just that his efficency as a jump shooter likely takes a leap this year as opposed to last year if we trust the trend. || I heard some bball analyst say something really interesting about his poor FT % to start the year - that with his tweaked shot mechanics, it's normal for the FTs to lag a bit. Players tend practice and perfect the shot from the field until it's muscle memory, and then they focus on the mechanics change to FTs. That the muscle memory may not be quite there yet and you're thinking about it more on a FT bc it's not in the flow of the game. Makes some sense. || Same dude who says 48% 3P% on 104 attempts is a small sample is saying 67% FT% on FORTY THREE attempts is something to seriously consider? Shameless😂 || It’s really interesting what’s happening and I too was thinking about it last night. Not just about him bout about the nba ten years down. Teams may have to begin jumping him right over half court like they did with Lillard or Harden for a while. || 4% higher 3p% on 50% higher volume yeah it was a really really long hot streak || if he's currently a ""true"" 38-39% shooter (which is my guess right now) then 40% over 110 games is well within the realm of possibility.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.016,0.894,0.09,0.9899,0.058,0.774,0.168,0.9996

Recapitulating the conventional knowledge about a player in order to rate them against other players at the surface level is unlikely to generate interesting insights. || C’mon man. They broke their playoff drought two years ago. Had an epic series against the Warriors where Draymond stomped on Sabonis. It makes it hard to take the rest of the post seriously after that big of an omission. || He may be better than Bam Adebayo, but he has never been and I don’t think he will be better than Anthony Davis. I won't be a bad fan and say he's trash, because he definitely deserve his flowers, but I'm not a big fan of his game. It’s a weird type of player to build around. || U can’t just omit a huge part of the game. Sabonis a better offensive player than bam and on par w ad.

But ad and bam r both dpoy candidates year after year while Sabonis is below avg to avg defender. This is especially important as the center position is the most imoortant position to be good defensively. It’s large reason why the Knicks r struggling rn and why most nba finals teams have a rly good defensive center. || I would whole heartedly agree if you added ""in the regular season""  Night to night during the regular season he is super consistent.  It's when he is put in a 7 game series that teams begin to figure him out and scheme around his weaknesses. || He not close to ad but he might be better than bam. The shit I been seeing from bam is atrocious || He’s not better than bam or ad. We have to stop ignoring the defensive side of basketball. Bam and AD are some of the most versatile and impactful defenders in the league no debate.  That value has been evident when their respective teams go on deep playoff runs. ( bam against bucks and NYC in 23) ( AD vs Memphis and warriors 23) Sabonis is a good player no hate but let’s slow down || You mentioned he's greater than AD and Bam. You didn't mention any wings or guards. 

If rebounding is a stat you'd like to highlight, then Drummond should be known as the most consistent player of the over the past 15 years. 

[Reference ](https://craftednba.com/player-traits/consistency) || [removed] || Sabonis is a regular season player. He has and will continue to struggle in the playoffs due to his terrible defense and way he tries to use his strength on offense. Not worth the money he’s paid IMO if a team has aspirations to make noise in the playoffs. || He cant defend though. His numbers always seem slightly empty because of this || I really hope the kings get him some inside help, Alex Len has been helpful but isn’t going to provide enough minutes to really provide any relief from Sabonis being left alone vs all of the opposing bigs for the majority of each game. I’m really interested to see how he does with more room to maneuver and rotate to really flex his offensive and facilitation potential. It might also help him not get punched in the face 3-4 times a game. || Every single day somebody posts some absurd pro Sabonis take and then months in to the season kings and Sabonis fans come out of the woodwork to whine about Sabonis being overhated. This cycle is so obnoxious || Sabonis is a very consistent player, very good rebounder and even better passer, but a somewhat average shooter from midrange at best. I remember when Golden State eliminated them that they were sagging off in defense and daring him to shoot, which is never a good sign. 

That being said, there is no way in hell he's as good as AD. Not offensively, not defensively. He's a better creator, but that's about it. He can give you 15-20 and 10, not 30+ and 15+ like AD. The Lakers' past few seasons failures have led people to really underestimate AD, it seems. || As long as SGA plays in the NBA or at least leads OKC, Domantas can’t be Mr. Consistent, plain and simple. || Sabonis is not a star player I would want to have in the playoffs compared to his peers.

Similar to Westbrook in his prime vs. Chris Paul. Russell may have an MVP and crazy triple double stat lines but when it comes to winning important ball games, I’d stick it out with players that understand how to win. || You could have just said ""Sabonis over AD and Bam is crazy ngl"" || Typo you are right trying to get to the edit button lol || Yeah Sabonis might be better than bam in terms of talent or something, but I would much much rather have bam on my team. Sabonis’s defense messes up the whole rest of the roster construction. || He’s not offensively on par w AD even w his playmaking || Sabonis has been legitimately good on defense since last season, just because he doesn’t put up big block/steal numbers doesn’t mean he’s not solid on D. Of course he’s nowhere near the elite defensive prowess of AD/Bam/Gobert, but he always seems to be in the right position, bangs in the post effectively against guys like Jokic/AD, and is surprisingly agile on the perimeter for a guy his size. Last year he even locked up Curry on 2 consecutive possessions after getting switched onto him in crunch time, poking the ball away twice and forcing a clutch turnover that eventually led to a Kings victory. If you watch nearly every Kings game, you’ll find out that being big and white with a below average wingspan ≠ automatically poor defender

AD > Sabonis > Bam || Please keep your comments civil. This is a subreddit for thoughtful discussion and debate, not aggressive and argumentative content. || The Kings FO has a (sa)boner for small guards while neglecting the frontcourt lmao

There's a logjam at the guard positions (including their draft pick, Devin Carter, who's injured, and they passed on (among others) Kel'el Ware, Dalton Knecht, Tristan Da Silva, Yves Missi, Ryan Dunn, Bobi Klintman and Jaylen Wells to pick him), while the front court is still giving regular minutes to end-of-the-bench caliber players like Trey Lyles and Doug McDermott || Don’t think that really applies to Chris Paul either. Prime Chris Paul never even made it to the WCF. He did later when he played with Harden and then the Finals with Booker and the Suns, but Westbrook did that too with KD before his prime.  

I think Chris Paul is the better all time PG and better floor raiser for the regular season but not sure this is even an example that makes sense. Plus Sabonis is a pretty good floor raiser himself.  || I wouldn't have bothered commenting if that was all I wanted to say. || And he disappears in the playoffs and refuses to shoot to space the floor. Hopefully he plays better but I think it’s just who he is a regular season stat padder (hate me all you want, look at his playoff numbers and get back to me) || I never use blocks and steal counting to evaluate good or bad defence because a lot of defensive ability are things that cannot be kept track off with advanced stats or box score. Sabonis has consistently struggle in the playoffs due to his defensive issues. I think for the center position it’s very detrimental when the 5 man is such a weak point. I haven’t watched every kings regular season game so maybe I’ll have to keep my eye on them next few weeks and  create a reevaluation of my position. || Chris Paul was pretty great in every playoff series  he just didn't have a top 100 all time team mate till he was past his prime. I feel given his rosters his teams always performed well in the playoffs. || Yeah, I mean he’s definitely not a *great* defender due to his lack of rim protection, but he more than holds his own out there with everything else he does do well, and he’s definitely not a “weak point” — there’s no way the Kings would be an above-average defensive team overall (14th in DRtg last season, 11th so far this season) if Sabonis, who plays 37 minutes per game as the Kings’ only active big on the roster other than Alex Len, didn’t have a positive impact on overall team defense. On top of that, he plays the most of his minutes in a small starting lineup where either Keegan Murray or DeRozan — both natural 3s on defense — has to play up a position to the 4, which puts even more responsibility on Sabonis to play with physicality the entire game and lead the league in rebounds per game like he has the past 2 seasons (rebounding counts as part of defensive impact, too). 

Nothing he does on defense is glamorous (i.e. getting popped in the face several times every game + a lot of communication), but it gets the job done most of the time except against certain matchups. He usually plays well against guys like Davis, Jokic, Bam, etc. who aren’t used to getting bodied by guys who are stronger than they are, but he always seems to struggle with the few bigs in the league who are both bigger and stronger than him, as we saw tonight against Zubac and in previous instances against guys like Valanciunas, Nurkic at times, etc. Regardless, if you do end up watching some upcoming Kings games, you’ll see that even without the ability to erase teammates’ mistakes that elite defensive big men possess, he’s still clearly a net positive on an above-average Kings defense (feels weird to think about the Kings as a good defensive team but they actually kind of are now)",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.015,0.884,0.101,0.9917,0.08,0.753,0.167,0.9996

Obviously, the truth is somewhere in the middle, as it always is, Minnesota's defense in the second half of Game 7 was incredible. But Denver, with one of the best offensive engines in the history of the game in his 3rd MVP season in 4 years managed just 37 points in the second half and blew a 20-point lead.

I get Boston’s offense revolves around knocking down three pointers, but I feel this limits JT’s game if he’s shooting this many due to Mazzula. 



What surprised me even more is that he doesn’t even lead the league in 3PA.



1. Lamelo Ball is averaging 12.8 3PA on 36.1%

2. Anthony Edwards is averaging 11.3 3PA on 42.4%

3. Jayson Tatum is averaging 11.1 3PA on 38.1%

4. Luka Doncic is averaging 10.1 3PA on 32.1%


4 all-nba caliber players are settling for three’s way too much imo. All those players are elite at driving to the paint, but instead half their FGA are three pointers. If you look at their most efficient games it’s always the ones they shoot less three’s in as well.

Please show which games he is more efficient (I assume you mean TS%) when he shoots fewer 3s || Shooting 38% from 3 is worth the same as 57% from 2 in terms of points per shot.  Plus the threat of the 3 forces the defense to defend a larger area which opens up opportunities elsewhere on the court.  Not all 3s are created equal, but launching 3s at high volume isn't necessarily bad.  Tatum isn't a great mid-range shooter, so I have no problem with his diet of 3s, layups and free throws. || [removed] || It makes a little more sense when you watch the games. Defenses are shading heavily to prevent Tatum from having a clear path to the rim, and I’d say at least half of the time he has the ball inside the three point arc he is deliberately baiting the double team so that he can pass to the open man, and then a good chunk of drives where he is looking to get to the basket he still ends up passing after the defense collapses. 

So while the 3 pointers are the majority of his shot attempts, they’re not the majority of his offensive plays, if that makes sense. 

But the Celtics offense is built around the threat of Tatum getting to the basket and exploiting the way defenses try to prevent that.

Edit: also worth adding that drives ending in free throws don’t count as a shot attempt in the paint even though that’s really what they are, and Tatum is averaging a career high in FTA. || Everyone but Doncic is setting a career high in TS% so it seems it's working out alright for them. || You have to look at the actual shot charts. These guys are just taking their mid-range shots from 3 now. Shots at the basket are mostly the same, 3 pointers are up, midrange is down. I don't know why there is this assumption that players are giving up layups and dunks to shoot more from deep. || 38 percent on eleven attempts is elite shooting. There's no reason for him to shoot less if he maintains that percentage. Luka and Ant are the same. Luka's percentage is bad but he shot 38 percent last year so I expect it to climb up. Lamelo's true shooting is as high as it's ever been and he's averaging nearly 30. Three is more than two. KD would average 30 every year if he just simply shot more threes. || [removed] || If you hit in the high 30s you are justified in taking 10+ attempts a game. 

38% is 1.14 points per possession.

The average half court possession is 0.95 points per possession. 

So as you can see chucking a lot of 3s and making them at high 30s is pretty damn good relative to a half court possession. The Celtics are currently the second best offense in the league. 

There's only 2 questions remaining. If you're chucking a lot of 3s, are you settling, when you could be driving for easier shots or manufacturing open shots for other shooters? Since the Celtics rank 2nd in offense it doesn't seem like the case. Tatum is still averaging 8.6 FTA per game which is a career high. 

The other is if shooting 3s at high volume is sustainable come playoffs? Tatum has not had a good track record of keeping up that efficiency. He is a career 38% shooter from 3, but in 4 out of 7 of his postseasons he's shot worse than 33% from 3. 

Lamelo Ball is a chucker. He's always been a low IQ chucker going back to his high school and NBL days. He's just 6'8, has a handle, and a green light and his shot is improved. But he is taking 23.5 shots per game, a 37.5% usage rate and is averaging 29 ppg, which is relatively low for that number of shot attempts. (For reference, Kobe, who is considered the chuckiest of chuckers, averaged 31.6 ppg on 22.8 FGA and a 33.6 USG rate in 2007). Lamelo is not all-NBA caliber and definitely not the greatest at driving. At his height is shooting 61% in the restricted area which is abominably below average for ball handlers at his height, and is only taking 5 free throws a game. 

Edwards is shooting hot, but historically is not known to be that good of a shooter. Could be just on a hotstreak. His FTA have dropped for 4.4 per game. 

Luka is currently shooting poorly, but his conditioning has always been poor, and he does take too many 3s. He is most efficient on those 3s when he is able to get a switch on a big man, but his efficiency is just not as good when guarded by a faster/strong wing. As it stands the Mavericks are going through a retooling of their offense where they want Luka off the ball more and not be so dependent on him. He has never been an outstanding catch and shoot player. He is still taking 6.7 FTA which is lowest of his career. || Well technically speaking shooting a 33% or more from 3 is equivalent to shooting 50% or better from 2. So he’s still playing winning basketball by shooting >33% it’d only be an issue if he was jacking up shots at a lower than 33% clip || Terrible analysis, in my opinion. You'd do great as a pundit or talking head on ESPN. These guys are shooting the equivalent to \~60% from 2 when it comes to pps. I'm all for it if I'm the coach. || Ant and Tatum are 2 of the leagues best shooters, in fact id argue that they are the best shooters (Steph Curry doesnt count ofc). Its completely fine for them to shoot 3s. Tatum specially since he needs the threat of the pull up to get the clean drives, he isnt like Ant or Ja when they can just blitz past you and be in the paint, he needs to leverage his 3  to get space.

Luka is just shooting abnormally bad due to injury, hes the only out of the 4 id agree that he needs to take a few less 3s when hes so out of rhythm. || Lamelo definitely isn't elite at driving the paint. 

I have a hard time imagining Ant is more efficient in games where he shoots less 3s considering he's hitting them at 42% clip and 3 is bigger than 2.

It's the new NBA until the NBA changes the 3 point shot we're going to see a lot of this. || Tatum is a career .389 shooter between 10FT-3PT line (20.55% of his total career FGA), and is shooting .378 from that range this year (16.07% of total FGA this year). He's a career .376 3PT shooter (39.03% of total career FGA), and is shooting .381 from downtown this year (55.36% of total FGA this year).    
    
Would you prefer that Tatum ""settle"" for a dribble pull-up middy more often, as he has done for a lot of his career? Tatum has obviously chosen to take a more valuable shot which he is better at, and is setting career-high marks in FTr and FTA (so it's not coming at the expense of him attacking the basket and getting to the line) too, so it seems to be working out well for him and his team. || Steph is only 12th in 3PA that’s pretty surprising. Doubt he remains that low though. || When since Lamelo was elite at driving to the paint? He has literally had a below league average 2 point percentage every single year of his entire career, including this one. 

Same with Ant. He has also had a below league average 2 point percentage every single year of his entire career, including this one. 

Tatum is actually good at it but not so much that he is elite at it. He is a more efficient scorer outside the arc than in it. 

The only guy here who I would argue is elite inside the arc is Luka. He is also the only one who is a better scorer inside the arc than outside of it. But he is just too out of shape to drive to the rim all the time at the start the year. || Oh they’ll be driving a bunch in the playoffs. NBA is leaning towards regular season mattering less and less || [removed] || Look at the team’s individual TS% this season, and at how many of their guys are shooting above 65% from 0-3 feet. They have the second highest Ortg in the league. 

Working exactly as intended. || Owen Phillips at the F5 had a really nice post on 3PA and how to think about high volume shooters. 

https://thef5.substack.com/p/just-chuck-it

Take home as other commentators have pointed out is that what used to be mid range are now 3s and that most players are taking the right number of 3s for what their offense needs. 

I really liked his plot showing how much a defense guards you correlates with 3PA and not 3P fg%

For a lot of players, there are some shots that you'd want to see removed from their shot diet, but it's not the total number that's the concern. 

For instance, as a Spurs fan, I was more concerned with the shots Wemby was taking early, when he was taking off the dribble threes from 32 feet with 18 seconds left on the shot clock and breaking the flow of the offense. Those are bad threes, even though some went in. 

In recent games, he's shot more (and better) but most of them have been pick and pop/trailer threes from a foot or two away from the line. I'd be fine if he took 15 - 20 of those a game, they're generally wide open, he's a good shooter. 

The number isn't the concern, it's the number of bad threes. || I assure you, if you are hitting 3s at 38% or better on high volume than you should keep shooting them. Its literally a statistcal advantage over him shooting 50% from inside 15 ft. || Tatum shooting 11 3’s at 38% is a really good thing and only opens his game for more driving lanes if he’s hitting from 3 || The whole Celtics offense is a bunch of 3's. Idk the averages, but I won't be surprised if they're at 50 3's a game. And when you watch them, they make a lot of them. And what's crazy is, their defense is still elite.

Mazzula understands what he has in his roster. That starting 5 are all elite 3 pt shooters, so he sticks with that.

With Tatum, it's quite the opposite, he's shooting 11 3's a game, because most teams take away the paint. || Player shooting a career high in 3pt attempts is averaging career highs in eFG% and TS% (despite being near his career low in FT%) and this is bad? Tatum is near the top of the leader board for every advanced metric that matters. The Celtics are 11-3 with a +10 net rating (despite no KP and poor shooting from Brown and Hauser). What are we even doing here? I love when the mods here go to the trouble of removing comments for being ""low effort"" when the post they're made on is scraping the bottom of the barrel. The decline of basketball discourse continues || When you shoot a 3, you still have a chance to get the rebound/immeidately eliminates chances of turning it over. Spaces the floor also, as the other team has to guard it, increasing 2 point % and giving drive openings.

  
So there is hidden value in it, and some analytics convinced a lot of teams to increase attempts this year. || Ima push back on the Lamelo better without 3s just because he sucks at finishing layups but he does settle for 3s a lot. I also have noticed he’s taking super lazy looking 3s now vs early in the year when he was knocking down 40%.

If Antman is knocking em down at a 42% clip he should let em fly. Thats equivalent to a 63% 2pt fg%

But yeah JT probably shoots too many although I’d push back on the notion that he’s elite getting to the hole and he’s always settled for 3s, I wouldn’t blame Mazz.

and Luka really needs to get his % up. I swear he always starts the year this way which is probably why he’s never been MVP || He’s still getting to the rim, he’s just replacing his midrange game with threes, which is undoubtably a positive || Its not terribly surprising when you look at how teams are defending him. They are selling out to keep him out of the paint and a lot of that is because we don't have a roll threat for a big with KP out. || I think it simultaneously makes sense for these guys to be chucking threes while also hurting the product from a viewer's standpoint.

So Sengun has looked massively improved on defense IMO. He's doing a much better job of contesting without fouling, players are shooting a lower percentage against him at the rim (\~53% which is a top 5 mark in the NBA), and he's lost some weight from last year that has allowed him to move laterally better than last season (example is he did a great job blitzing on Ant PnRs last night). All-in-all this individual improvement has lead to much better defensive performances from him. However, that being said Sengun is still not quick enough to really defend in isolation out on the perimeter so he's not switchable, and he still gets caught out with lob dunks on PnRs every now and then (but even this is much improved). He's no defensive stalwart, but he has definitely improved a ton as an individual defender this year.

The individual improvement is real, but a lot of the block and steals numbers are inflated this season due to Udoka's defensive scheme. Sengun has seen the largest increase in the NBA this year in percentage of the time defending wings. Udoka will have Jabari Smith or Dillon Brooks defend the opposing Center and main PnR roll threat, and then Sengun will often defend the worst shooting guard/wing. This allows Jabari/Dillon to switch on the perimeter during Center PnR actions, and also takes Sengun out of those actions so he can roam freely and defend the rim and go for steals. Some might say Udoka is doing this to effectively ""hide"" Sengun from those primary actions and it does have the benefit of that, but the reality is that Udoka just likes to have his Centers out of those PnR actions so that they can roam the paint to provide extra rim protection. He famously did this with Rob Williams in his one year with the Celtics to great effect, and the primary reason was indeed keeping him in the paint to defend the rim (and not to hide him). Having Sengun near the rim has lead to a big jump in his block numbers (they've nearly doubled), but the block numbers are probably inflated due to the defensive scheme.

Overall, he has improved on defense a ton this year (DBPM has doubled this year FWIW), and some of that is due to individual improvements but a good chunk of it is due to scheme as well. Udoka is utilizing him in a defensive scheme that maximizes his abilities at the moment. It has been working great during the regular season, but as a Rockets fan I am concerned how this scheme translates to the playoffs. If there is a match-up where Sengun can't sag off a poor shooting wing and is forced to defend the PnR possession after possession I think our defense will be nowhere near as effective as it is right now. I might just be worrying though because Sengun mainly defended Gobert last night and did really well in PnR coverage.

https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/nba-league-wide-three-point-percentage-by-decade


**Debunking the Myth: This Generation Doesn’t Shoot the 3-Ball That Much Better**  

For all the criticism players from the '80s, '90s, 2000s, and 2010s get for a supposed lack of three-point shooting, the reality is that today's NBA players only shoot the three about **0.5% to 1% better** than those earlier generations.  

It’s time to put this narrative to rest. Modern NBA fans often claim that today’s players would dominate past generations simply because they shoot the three-ball so much better. However, the data proves this isn’t true!  

### The Truth About Three-Point Shooting in Previous Eras  

Players in earlier generations had the talent to shoot from deep, but their coaches didn’t emphasize it. The game plan prioritized shooting **50% from the field**, and a **33% three-point percentage** was considered solid. Players weren’t encouraged to take as many threes as they are now.  

### Scoring Big Men vs. Three-Point Reliance  

Another overlooked factor:  
1. **Dominant big men** in previous eras reduced the need for three-point shooting. Centers and power forwards like Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O’Neal, David Robinson, Brad Daugherty, Rik Smits, Arvydas Sabonis (the OG), Rasheed Wallace, Alonzo Mourning, Patrick Ewing, Vin Baker, Shawn Kemp, Charles Barkley, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar were **20/10 threats**.  
   - Today’s centers would struggle against these Bigs.  

Over time, the NBA shifted from dominant big men to three-point shooting. However, the big man’s role hasn’t disappeared. In fact, **four of the last five NBA champions** relied on strong big-man play:  

- **2024 Boston Celtics** – Kristaps Porziņģis (“The Unicorn”) & Al Horford’s bench production/three-point shooting  
- **2023 Denver Nuggets** – Nikola Jokić  
- **2022 Golden State Warriors** – N/A (the “Steph Curry Effect”)  
- **2021 Milwaukee Bucks** – Giannis Antetokounmpo & Brook Lopez  
- **2020 Los Angeles Lakers** – Anthony Davis & Dwight Howard’s defense  

When the game slows down in the playoffs and becomes more physical, rebounding, interior defense, and scoring in the paint become critical because **baskets are harder to come by**.

### Less Space, More Physicality  

2. The older generations also played in a **more physical** era with **less spacing**. Players had to excel at shooting with defenders crowding them.  
   - Today’s game features more space, yet older players hit consistent jumpers without the benefit of modern floor spacing. Their comparable three-point percentages are a testament to their skill.  

With less space and more physicality, finishing at the rim was harder. The idea that today’s players are vastly superior shooters doesn’t hold up. They just take more threes. Yes, players like **Steph Curry** and **Damian Lillard** are remarkable, but they are **outliers**, not the standard—which is why they’re celebrated and multi-time All-Stars.  

### Team USA’s Struggles with Old-School Basketball  

To illustrate the point: look at how **Team USA** struggled with **’90s-style basketball** in FIBA competitions. With tighter spacing and more physicality, they had difficulty against teams with **1-2 NBA players** or none at all—despite having multiple All-Stars, MVPs, and Finals winners.  

### Respect the OGs  

Today’s players are incredible, and that’s undeniable. But it’s time to put respect on the OGs. Just because they played before your time doesn’t mean they weren’t great.  

Let’s give credit where it’s due.  ",0,10,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1h4nlph/2020s_nba_generation_3pt_shooting_skills_are/,2024-12-02 00:16:27,"biggest thing i disagree with is the 3pt shooting. of course when you shoot more shots the 3pt percentage isn’t gonna be as high. all the shots in the 90s were mainly open 3s. people now shoot stepbacks and sidesteps which aren’t gonna come at a high percentage. besides that the rest of the post seems pretty solid || Just looking at how 3p% has stayed the same for the last decade or so is only one part of the whole story on how shooting has changed over the years. Modern players shoot more and significantly difficult shots from 3 than players did previously, and this is absolutely because modern players have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they can shoot the piss out of the ball. Old school players would get yelled at for shooting a 3 at the very start of the possession or off the dribble, not because the coaches were dumb, but because they just weren’t as good of shooters as people are now. The 3pt revolution exists because players’ shooting ability forced coaches to admit that all these 3s are generally good shots now.

If you don’t believe some dude online that shooters are better now, then maybe you’ll believe the players themselves. Just watch modern nba DEFENSES. Defender pick guys up full court, fight over every screen, hug shooters in corner when the ball is 40ft away, and face guard dudes the whole game so much more often than they did back in the day. Spacing is so apparent now because defenses are forced to hug shooters close, when back in the day they could sag off a lot more on guys, especially the non shooters.

Its just simple logic, players shoot way more 3s now, so they practice way more 3s now, so they are better shooters || We have some of the best basketball ever played as far as skills all the way to the end of the benches.

I agree with you, the problem is the fans. There is no respect for the players current and old. 

We have a generation raised on trash commentary of Stephen A, and Jalen, and now Perkins. 

Everybody is spouting such reactionary things over single games, or a week of play. 

It feels like the attention span is getting shorter and people only remember last game. || I agree with this era not dominating the past but partially. I think the top players would have dominated in any era bc they could adapt. So the skill ceiling levels probably wouldn't be very different in any decade. But the floor is vastly different imo. There is no way the role to fringe players of a team 3 decades ago have the same skill level as today's role to fringe players of a team. People were getting drafted bc they needed bodies to hack Shaq. The skill floor has raised massively is my point. 

To tie it to your post about 3pt: yes, decades have similar percentages but earlier decades had very low average attempts and they were taken by the best 3pt shooters of that era. Whereas now, teams are shooting 3+ times more compared to 30 years ago and the percentages are still around the same. Meaning everyone is shooting and making 3s, skill floor included. 

My last point is basketball also became more popular, making the top 500 players of today (assuming NBA has all the top 500 players) better due to the sample size growing but the seats being limited.

Good post, thank you for being thorough. || This isn't true. 3pt shots in 90s were last second heaves alot of the time. Players also weren't practicing them as much. CERTAIN players nowadays shot stepback/sidestep. Most are standing in the corner and getting kickouts. || “Back in the day, old-school players got yelled at for taking 3-pointers, not because they lacked the skill, but because the mid-range game was the bread and butter of basketball at the time.  

Like I mentioned earlier, if today’s players were truly better shooters, their percentages would reflect that, regardless of volume.  

Take players like Harden, Curry, Dame, Reggie, or Ray Allen—these guys regularly took contested 3s, yet their percentages remained consistently high.  

When you’re a truly great shooter, volume doesn’t matter as much because your skill ensures your percentages balance out over time.” || Facts!  Most of the players that aren’t part of the “media” always respect the OGs, and how they paved the game for them.

Current fans are irrational, and forget to realize their was greatness in all erZ || still the volume alone has gone up by so much. you can’t expect the percentage to stay the same when the other teams are expecting a 3 every time || Doesnt matter, if you can shoot you can shoot!

We dont say that about Reggie Miller, Curry, Klay, Kyle Korver, etc

They all shot with volume. It’s either you can shoot it well and consistently, or you can’t.

And mos team shoot open kick out 3’s and transition 3’s …. this era has the most open 3s by far.

I want them to win every game they play, but I'm not particularly stoked on the idea of them having to play an extra game this season

Minutes are high, the season is long, injuries happen, and the idea of my team playing hard in an extra game that doesn't count for the regular season isn't something I'm excited about if it only amounts to an extra bubble on the players' Basketball Reference page and the opportunity to buy a fancy NBA Cup Champions t-shirt

Although it’s early in the season, it seems like Knicks are clear winners. However, I do think that there are a couple scenarios that could make this favorable to the Wolves: 
1. Upped production of Divincenzo. I will note I have watched maybe 1 twolves game but my understanding is that his production has been not very good and he’s been a let down thus far. 
2. Any injury to the Knick’s core group. Thibs keeps the rotation very tight and there is not a lot of depth on the Knick’s roster outside of starting 5 + McBride and they do have 2 players that I wouldn’t call injury prone but have had big injuries the past couple seasons (KAT, OG). Sure Robinson will come back and that will help, but I do think that an injury to one of their forwards or Hart and they could be feeling it pretty hard. || It's still really early. But as a Knicks fan I don't see any argument that in the short-term this trade looks like a huge win for the Knicks. This is clearly a much better offensive team. Their league best offensive rating does not look like a fluke, the lineup is stacked.  


 The Wolves also look to be in disarray. I think what it comes down to is that KAT is massively underrated. His unique skillset on offense practically guarantees an efficient offense. When he is at the 5 it's like a cheat code. But even at the 4 his floor stretching is still very valuable. Randle will never be as clean a fit because he plays slow and has a lot of poor possessions. I still think he gets too much hate but some criticism is certainly valid. But one offense, KAT is pretty much 100% upsode, I had no idea he was this good. || It is still early, but I still think Randle will continue to be a thorn in the side of Minnesota and that Minnesota closed their window with this trade. I assumed something like this would happen eventually, but I just thought it would happen after this season after the success they had last year and the pick of an older player that was expected to be ready early in Terrence Shannon and the move for Rob Dillingham. It looked like they were making win-now moves... then traded away their 2nd best player and the guy that has kind of been the main guy in Minnesota for almost a decade. || The trade was confusing from the jump, adding Julius Randle to the frontcourt with Gobert made zero basketball sense || Have you seen Randle chucking the ball at Gobert one play... And refusing to pass the next? Locker room alone... Knicks won || Right now, it looks like the Knicks won, but it's too early to know, KAT cap number might look different in a year or two

Not sure where you got that stat about guard/center 25ppg, but it happened last year with Embiid and Maxey || My assessment when the trade happened was that the Knicks would be good this season but look worse and worse every season over the next 2/3 years. And the Wolves would take a mild step back for now. 

And it kind of is playing out that way. But a lot of the Randle trade for the Wolves is marred by the fact that the core trio of Conley, DDV, and Jaden McDaniels have been playing very poorly to start the season. 

I happen to think both teams have a fair and equal chance of making the conference finals. Both conferences right now look difficult but have extreme parity after the Thunder, Mavs, Boston, and Cavs. || Wolves defense is almost back to being elite. Offensively if Conley isn't over the hill and if Donte/Jaden can make shots they'll be fine, but ""fine"" isn't as good as last year. Kat is just better than Randle and his chemistry with Gobert on both sides was better.


Knicks offense is elite, defense we'll see. They need Mitch. They're the winner so far || Why are people acting like Randle is playing badly or is a negative for Minnesota? He's having one of his best and most efficient seasons individually. Stylistically he might not be a perfect match for the rest of the squad, but he's holding up his end of the bargain by being the best version of himself at least, amd the Wolves knew what they were getting. || Knicks have the edge so far but since it was a multi player deal time will tell. The Wolves became a less competitive team overall and so far but we have to wait until season’s end to make a final decision. Randle isn’t guaranteed to resign w them and Donte looks like shit so far so again more time is needed. || People are way to quick to judge this trade tbh. 

The Wolves have fully re-established their defensive identity the last three games since the locker room boiled over. Yes, their record is bad right now but their point differential is pretty solid for a .500 team. 

If the last three games aren't a fluke and Randle bought in on the defensive end and chemistry issues ironed themselves out a bit, the wins will very quickly follow and the Wolves will be back in the playoffs. || [removed] || What bore out was what the majority of fans thought wolves lost, knicks won. The minority opinion that this made both teams better overrated Donte and expected him to be a 15-18ppg microwave scorer, which he just isnt.  || Knicks have the number 1 offense and is now 18th in defense. Getting precious has been a big gain. 

Wolves I still feel can get it together but too many strong personalities in the locker room || [removed] || [removed] || Knicks offense is humming and the defence looks a lot better the last few games over the last 10 or so games (particularly excluding the first celtics game). Precious, Mitch snd Landry coming back will help a lot with depth. || Trade can't really be judged properly until we see if they keep randle or flip him etc.

If knicks win a chip with Towns at any point next few years then they have to be the winners. And vice versa if wolves win with Ant.

Outside of that it's up to interpretation but so far Knicks are trending in the right direction.

I think wolves can be really good but not sure randle is a great fit at the 4 with Rudy. That seemed like an odd fit from the start. || All I know is I was trying to explain how it was a good trade for the Knicks and Knicks fans were ripping me apart for saying Randle was inconsistent and played selfish basketball lmao || I haven’t watched many Wolves games but I’ve read that Conley sucks now. If this is true then they should start Divincenzo @ the 1 and just put the ball in Ant’s hands full time. 

Divincenzo was killing it last year and probably didn’t want to leave NY to go to Minny and come off the bench. || You all are so funny.  4 wins in a row since Ant called the team out.  Donte is playing great, Mike is back, Rudy is amazing and Ant just dissected the Warriors defense.  Randle is playing defense and vibes are incredible. 

Kat’s is doing his best Bruce Banner impression and holding clowns back for now.  He will come out, and it will probably be in the playoffs.  Wolves fans saw it and know clowns well. 

Give this trade a full season before you decide whether someone won the trade. || Nearly every problem the Wolves have had - Weaker defense, bad Conley, DDV not shooting well, McDaniels regressing, bad team chemistry- has shown huge improvement over the last week. I think Knicks may have won it by a hair (if you take the cap situation completely out of the equation), but I don't think we can count out the strong possibility that the Timberwolves just had to go through a rough adjustment period before they could get back to business. As expected. || Depends on what Minny can flip Randle for. 

That move was always a two step process. We’ve only seen step on, so…TBD. || You can’t judge the trade after a few months. Minnesota didn’t make the trade for this season they partly wanted to get off KAT’s contract when he is due $57million in 26/27 and $61 million in 27/28. 

No-one know if KAT will have suffered another injury perhaps slowing or changing his game. It was always about the super-max which is ruinous to most teams. || I say this as the biggest Kat fan in the world. He was my favorite player since I’ve been an NBA fan (about 10 years). The results this year are irrelevant we had to move off the contract and got value pieces back. 

Wolves got exactly what they needed and Knicks are digging themselves a hole. That contract is an albatross. He’s gotta have MVP production to make it arguable that he’s worth it.

He pretty much covers towns weakness. 

Cam Payne has been amazing. 8/3 shooting 44% from 3 on 4 attempts. His defense surprises me the most. Unfortunately he got hurt. Knicks have a solid 9 man rotation once everyone gets healthy off the bench. || Also what will that FRP from the Knicks turn out to be?

Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2024-12-06,nbadiscussion,1h870io,"The Hawks are right where we thought they'd be, but look nothing like we expected [OC]","The Hawks are currently riding a five-game win streak that included consecutive wins against the league-leading Cleveland Cavaliers and a victory in Milwaukee that stopped the Bucks’ own seven-game streak.

It’s an impressive stretch, but the crazy part? They’re doing it with defense.

Since November 26th, the start of this five-game winning streak (including three games against elite offenses, mind you), [the Hawks rank ](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=11/26/2024&end=10/15/2025)[third](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=11/26/2024&end=10/15/2025)[ in defensive rating](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=11/26/2024&end=10/15/2025).

Third! Defense! The Hawks!

Last I checked, this is still the same team that gave up 133 points to the Wizards early in the season, but things have changed. It was never clearer than the fourth quarter of their win over Milwaukee. The Hawks [averaged less than a point per shot](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202412040MIL.html) in the ultimate period and took six fewer free throws than the Bucks. They still won the quarter 20-17.

Even this unexpected defensive surge isn’t happening the way you’d expect. The Hawks have been an excellent turnover-forcing team overall this season, thanks largely to Dyson Daniels (I went into more Daniels detail in naming him my [Perimeter Defender of the Quarter](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/first-quarter-awards-for-the-2024)), but they have been below-average in that regard during their win streak.

There is, of course, some shooting luck — but that cuts both ways. In the five recent games, [Hawks’ opponents have only shot 33% on triples](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/shots?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=11/26/2024&end=10/15/2025#tab-defense_shooting_accuracy) — but the Hawks only made 35%. (That partially makes up for the abysmal fortune the Hawks had for the first part of the season, as opponents shot nearly 41% from deep before the winning streak started).

Teams won’t always shoot that poorly, but it’s easy to construct a narrative that fits the recent numbers. Atlanta has a ton of length and energy on the roster. Rising star Jalen Johnson, rookie Zaccharie Risacher, and Daniels create a forest of grasping limbs for opposing ballhandlers and wings to navigate. It’s difficult to find Trae Young (trying harder on defense since Quin Snyder came to town, but still very bad) amidst all those trees. Even when opponents do get an open look, it’s not quite as safe as they think: \[[video GIF here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-hawks-are-exactly-where-we-expected)\]

Opponents naturally want to lunch on the Hawks’ weakest link, but there’s a little bit of a trap to hunting Young. The Hawks have the [second-worst points per possession allowed to ballhandlers](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/teams/54457dd3300969b132fcfe49/playtypes?seasonId=66ec94cbd172189f95bf08b2&competitionId=560100ac8dc7a24394b955ee&offense=false) out of the pick-and-roll, and they also give up that play type (and the similar dribble hand-off) at a very high rate.

But [ballhandlers shooting out of the pick-and-roll is actually the league’s least efficient action overall](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/how-differently-do-nba-teams-play). Atlanta's (and virtually every team’s) defensive principles prefer to give up the floater or the midrange in the pick-and-roll versus virtually any other shot. Even if it’s easier to do against Atlanta, it’s still a below-average possession overall.

In other words, teams can expose Young, and it can still lead to suboptimal offense. This is what it can look like in practice. Young gets drawn into the pick-and-roll and beat handily, but it still ends in a tricky floater as the other Hawks pack the paint: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-hawks-are-exactly-where-we-expected)\]

That’s not a bad look! NBA players have trained their whole lives to take and make open shots, and muscle memory takes over when they get a clean line of sight to the basket. But over the course of an entire game, taking five not-bad looks instead of five good ones can be the difference between winning and wondering what happened.

Schematically, the Hawks will switch all their wings, although they prefer to keep Young out of the action and center Clint Capela home in a drop. Their trademark is activity. Johnson, Daniels, Risacher, and even sixth man De’Andre Hunter of late are constantly scanning for opportunities to inject chaos into opposing offenses. They’re eager helpers, sometimes to a fault, and have a lot of faith in their ability to cover a whole lot of ground. If nothing else, effort is rarely a question. Look at how much distance Risacher has to cover for this monumental block: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-hawks-are-exactly-where-we-expected)\]

Although we all enjoy talking about the wings — they’re young and fun, two things that NBA fans love! — Capela deserves his flowers, too. Every year, rumors that he’ll be traded and/or surpassed on the depth chart by Onyeka Okongwu buzz around like repetitive, annoying mosquitoes, and every year, he grades out as an above-average drop rim-protector and vacuumer of rebounds who is simply too valuable to smash with a flyswatter, no matter how frustrating it is when he misses another bunny (there are a lot of parallels here with Phoenix’s Jusuf Nurkic, actually).

Okongwu is the off-speed pitch, the help-side shotblocker who can move his feet on the perimeter a little bit. The two are tag-teaming the center position while playing about equal minutes, and while neither is elite (Okongwu’s pick-and-roll defense has left me a little cold for years), there’s value in having different looks to throw at offenses.

For all that positive talk, the Hawks are still giving up more threes than anyone in the league, which is rarely a recipe for long-term success. But teams have also generally made them, and the season-long defensive rating is *still* 13th, thanks to turnovers and solid rim protection. It’s reasonable to think the Hawks’ defense could settle in around 10th going forward, which opens the door for Atlanta to make some noise if their offense can get in gear.

And they might be on the right path; the offense ranks seventh in this five-game streak (although just 15th on the year — worse than their defense). Like many people, I expected the Hawks to be an offense-first team, but most of their rotation has been colder than a Magic City beer. De’Andre Hunter has been lights out of late, Johnson is decent on mediocre volume, and deep rotation guy Garrison Matthews is a 46% shooter this season, but the team is suffering through poor marksmanship from nearly every other notable player.

The ballyhooed Daniels has been unable to find his touch, hitting just 29% from downtown (although he’s at least putting up four attempts per game, which is still low but more than ever before). Risacher has been extremely aggressive, putting up nearly nine triples per 100 possessions — that’s a great sign for his long-term development, but he’s also sub-30% from deep on the season. The usually reliable Bogdan Bogdanovic is barely netting a third of his attempts, and worst of all? Trae Young is batting like Marcell Ozuna; 30.6% (on huge volume) is by far the worst mark of his career. Young is only shooting 21% from deep during this five-game win streak!

*Some* of those guys will start hitting shots (Bogdanovic and Young, most likely), and when they do, the rest of the offense will follow. The team is also[ fifth-worst in turnover rate over this win streak](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=11/26/2024&end=10/15/2025); that can be cleaned up to a degree (and will further benefit their defense, too).

There are the bones of a really promising system here. Atlanta is [top-10 in both rim attempts and corner threes](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/shots#tab-offense_shooting_frequency). The Hawks run like hell — second in pace this season, [per Inpredictable](https://stats.inpredictable.com/nba/ssnTeamShot.php). They have a bevy of ballhandlers and passers, meaning most of the rotation can grab-and-go.

The Hawks are [third in assists and potential assists per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/passing?dir=D&sort=AST); they spread the ball around like butter on toast. But Young and Johnson deserve special mention.

For all the attention on Dyson Daniels’ attempt to get three steals per game, Young is chasing an arguably even more interesting statistical benchmark. He’s currently averaging 12.0 assists per game. If that holds, it would be [the most by a player in ](https://stathead.com/basketball/player-season-finder.cgi?request=1&year_min=1947&display_type=per_g&ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&cval%5B1%5D=12&cstat%5B1%5D=ast_per_g)[30 years](https://stathead.com/basketball/player-season-finder.cgi?request=1&year_min=1947&display_type=per_g&ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&cval%5B1%5D=12&cstat%5B1%5D=ast_per_g). John Stockton was the last to crack 12 dimes, and he did it in each of the first five years of the 90s. Nash, Rondo, Westbrook, the Point God himself — none of those guys had a full season with 12 assists per game.

It’s widely accepted that Jokic is the best passer in the league, and I’ve made that argument myself. Beyond his uncanny vision and feel, his height gives him sightlines few can access. But nobody possesses as much sheer passing talent inch-for-inch and pound-for-pound as Young. He’ll hit the lob, give defenders haircuts with bullets to sneaky cutters, throw off-handed skip passes right to a shooter’s pocket (Young’s ambidexterity as a passer is underrated). Most fun of all, he’s a master of improvisation: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-hawks-are-exactly-where-we-expected)\]

Next to him, Jalenn Johnson has emerged as a legitimate point forward. He takes full advantage of *his* height to launch pinpoint outside-inside dimes. When he’s feeling a little cheeky, he’ll launch a little hook pass that reminds me of Karl-Anthony Towns’ signature move (although Johnson is having a better passing season than Towns has ever had): \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-hawks-are-exactly-where-we-expected)\]

I sang Johnson’s praises before the season, when I predicted he’d be an All-Star. He’s been everything I hoped for, a well-rounded force who can impact the game in a multitude of ways. He’s averaging 20/10 and more than five assists, and he’s an above-average positional defender, too. He’s one of the few players equally comfortable on both ends of a pick-and-roll, and he’s even improved his three-point volume and accuracy each year of his career: 36% on 4.5 attempts per game ain’t Steph Curry, but it’s a functional weapon.

Risacher is still working on his marksmanship, but he’s already a savvy vet in nearly every other aspect of the game. He came into the league a strong defender, quick thinker, and instinctual cutter who knows how to catch even the best defenders off-guard: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-hawks-are-exactly-where-we-expected)\]

Thanks to an early-season injury to De’Andre Hunter, Risacher has started nearly every game this season, but it might’ve worked out better for the Hawks this way. Traditionally, Bogdan Bogdanovic has led the Hawks’ bench mob, but Hunter has been their best reserve of late. He’s been good enough off the pine this season that the Hawks would be wise to consider it a permanent move. This season, he’s averaging a career-high in scoring (18.7 points per game!), true shooting, steals, free-throw attempts, three-pointers attempted, and three-point percentage, all while playing the fewest minutes of his career. While Risacher starts, Hunter usually closes, which seems to be working just fine.

Fun fact: the Hawks are 7-0 when Hunter scores at least 15 points and 5-11 when he doesn’t play or scores fewer than 15.

To summarize: The Hawks’ shooters can’t hit shots. Their defense is better than their offense, and they start a rookie. Atlanta is playing differently than expected. Yet, at 12-11, they’re more or less where consensus thought they would be.

Nobody has had higher highs or lower lows this season. Is this team capable of consistently playing like the one that beat the Celtics and the Cavaliers? Or is this team closer to the one that gave the Wizards their only two wins of the season?

Only time can tell. The most likely outcome is that the Hawks hover around .500 for most of the year and try to avoid the play-in, notching some incredible victories and incomprehensible losses; basically, who they’ve been so far. But this isn’t really about this season. The team’s youthful core of Johnson, Risacher, Daniels, and Young (yes, I’m still including the 26-year-old with just one for-sure year left on his contract in their youthful core) has been a blast to watch and shown a lot of upside.

It is tempting to practice some [catoptromancy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catoptromancy)and see a Young-captained top-five offense complemented by switchable two-way wings charging through the East in the not-too-distant future.

","I’ve always thought something bigger happened during the LeBron era with the Lakers. He joined a franchise that had been at the bottom of the NBA for years. He brought Anthony Davis, won a championship, increased national TV appearances, boosted audience and ticket sales, brought in more sponsorships, and so on.

He even basically ran a YouTube show to hire a new coach (or fire the old one) with JJ Redick, and a couple of months later, that coach got the job despite having zero experience. He brought Bronny in on a guaranteed contract and has a few Klutch Sports guys on the payroll.

Jeanie Buss has always had the reputation of being an owner whose wealth depends on the Lakers, unlike Ballmer or Ishbia. From my point of view, LeBron seems to have a much deeper interest in the Lakers beyond all the Hollywood stuff and he invest a lot into this franchise. 

Do you think LeBron saved the Buss family from having to sell part of the Lakers? 

Do you think their business would still be doing fine without him?

For reference look at the Knicks…they’ve been consistently bad with short blips of competitiveness and their brand is still much stronger than most in the league. || The cowboys, Celtics, bulls, lakers, Yankees etc. are teams that will be fine with or without a big attraction.

James helps but without him they wouldn’t be hurting. || Lakers will be fine. They are bigger than LeBron even if it seems like he runs things. 

Jeannie is a “poverty” owner compared to Balmer but there are many more cheaper owners in the league and she has the benefit of the Lakers brand which, globally, is still the top team due to decades of legacy. The Lakers even if they are at the bottom of league will always sell out tickets and make money and be a top franchise. || They likely would have landed some combination of Kawhi, Paul George and AD instead. 


Maybe it would have gone better with AD than PG, but they would probably look a bit closer to the Clippers today.  || No matter how bad the Lakers are, at the end of the season they are one of the teams that make up the most revenue for the league as they are a big market. || I don’t think LeBron’s intention with the YouTube channel was to get JJ the coaching position. Remember, the Lakers made an offer to a college coach for like $70m and he shocked everyone by turning it down. || As a Laker fan I think they would have been fine.  Probably not competing for a title, but the Lakers have been good at drafting/scouting. They would of had some of those picks they traded for AD and win now moves.  A core of Randle, Lonzo, Kuzma, Zubac, Caruso, KCP, Hart, and picks is a decent team. || If not LeBron they wouldve landed another huge named star player because theyre in LA. That's enough pull for most people. || The Lakers ain't doing anything without LeBron joining them. Yup, they mortgaged their whole future on LeBron. But these mfs had 4 years (after Kobe) to build something, and nothing happened.
That franchise was lost.

Yup, they'll have a young core, but that ain't getting anywhere with that type of team. 

Picking Ball (benefit of hindsight) was definitely a mistake. What kind of future do you want LA to build with Ball and Ingram out there? 
Ingram is good, but even if he's in his prime now, he's not enough. 
Who's next? Zubac? DLo? 
Your Big 3 would've been DLo, Ingram, Ball? 

Ya'll acting like LeBron ruined this franchise, he didn't. He sped up the process, and added a ring to it, because they have no clue what they're doing in LA. They were going nowhere fast. 

I guarantee, with the type of ownership the Lakers has, they ain't winning anything, and that young core would slowly leave via free agency. 

The reality is, the Lakers were doomed no matter what. And LeGm saved their butts, by building a great roster in 2020. (Let's be real, he GM'ed that whole roster). But, LeBron also ruined it, by trading for Russ. || Yes, LeBron saved Buss ownership.

People here are delusional. I actually went to a bunch of games in post Kobe - pre LeBron period. For most games tickets were dirt chip and Staples was half empty lots of the times. LA celebrities were nowhere to be seen and they would only be given a few nationwide TV games.

Lakers would have to pay up for all the young and unexciting core of DLo, Randle, Ingram, Lonzo that would obviously lead them to achieve nothing. All of those would be bad contracts so trading up would be a heck of a challenge. LAL would be entering season 12 of being irrelevant and uninteresting. || Probably like the Knicks but I doubt they miss on talent as hard though.

Not a half bad roster at all assuming they're all healthy, and 3 of these guys are/have been All-Star talents. || No all the LeBron era has done is kicked the can down the road for the Lakers next big signing. The Lakers were a horrible team during the 2010s because they did the same thing with Kobe. Gave him the huge deal and kicked the can down the road for their next big move… LeBron and AD. The Lakers are the only team in the NBA that can afford to do this. It’s how they operate. || Likely much worse than they are now.

Yes, the brand would still be there. No doubt. But, I'm not forgetting how awful AND irrelevant the Lakers were before Bron showed up. Post-Kobe.

You can suck but have an attraction. Can be really good and lack a megastar. You can't be awful AND have no stars.

LeBron also meant AD. And brought the Lakers a title.

Alternative may have been something like Kawhi and PG. But, we don't have to imagine how such a pairing would have played out. We WATCHED IT. || I think you'd see them turn out like the Bulls right now. Ownership coasting off decades old wins and players. Not spending too much. 


They'd still occasionally assemble a playoff capable team (young Lakers probably would have gotten there if they had Lebron and AD's max slots open).


 Top players would have come to the Lakers at some point like Lebron did, or Lakers could have easily gone for a trade. Market is too enticing, plus you could be the savior for the Lakers by bringing playoffs after 5+ years of being ass.


They would have had some good draft pick numbers available without trading everything for AD. Maybe Lakers snag Morant, Garland, Edwards etc in those 2019 to 2024 draft years. 


Ticket sales would probably be ok as long as Lakers weren't still bottom feeders after the 2019 season. Bulls I think are still selling out all the time || I think they would be fine but in general I think historic teams with a big ‘brand’ or market and long history of being good is not as appealing as it once was across all sports. Big market, storied teams used to be able to get players because of their name solely but I don’t really see that being the case going forward. The lakers for instance are probably nearing the end of being able to land people just because they are the Lakers and people want to play in L.A. people like klay and derozan seemingly had no interest playing there and instead went to smaller market teams while the lakers org was convinced they would come just because it was L.A.  And yes I know those guys had other factors in their decisions but I would guess that as time goes on teams like the Lakers will be looked on like any other subpar team/org in the league and their brand with start to take a bit of a hit. || JJ Redick played in the NBA for 14 years and appearently he's a very smart guy, well respected and liked around the league. Yes, he didn't have coaching experience; but I don't think that was outlandish for him to get the Lakers job.

As for LeBron and the Lakers, yes, of course LeBron is an excellent business move for them. But it goes both ways.  Lakers isn't the Cavs, they will always be a relevant franchise. Even when they suck, their draft picks, young players make the headlines. || [removed] || The Lakers never needed LeBron as far as Money goes. Like Cowboys they will always have  a huge following no matter how bad they are. 



The reason the Lakers sucked for as long as they did was cause they gave a huge contract to Kobe who as far as being a player didnt deserve that after the Injury. 



The Magic, Ball  experiment crashed and burned badly because Lonzo is a good Ball player but not #1 material. || They'll do fine. I think they were top 5 in jersey sales even during the period between Kobe and LeBron. Assuming that LeBron didn't come and they didn't make any trades, the younger players that they were developing would likely be competitive too.  || [removed] || This is essentially the lakers business model, they have the ability to just sign stars, Kareem, then Shaq, then Lebron are the big superstars that start up the laker contention machine. Not to mention the second level of stars and superstars like AD, Pau gasol, Wilt ( was still a star but a far cry from who he was previously and his spot as a top 5 player was 100% sliding if he wasn’t already outside of it, I’d say he was the 3rd best player on the lakers behind Jerry west and Elgin Baylor). They are the most attractive spot historically for stars to go to. So I think if it wasn’t bron it would’ve been someone else eventually would’ve and the capital and young players to go for a possible trade too. || Firstly bottom of the barrel for years isn't exactly true they were struggling but Kobe only retired a few years before bron got there so they were still a fan favorite. Other than that they honestly they could theoretically be better than they are now. Assuming lebron doesn't go there they don't trade for win now pieces and their team is Lonzo, D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, Julius randle, mo Wagner, Nance, zubac, svi mchailuk Jaden McDaniels || Lakers dont win in 2020, but they would be doing better now.

LeBron is focused on himself and not the team. He needs to play 2 way (instead of slacking on defense), and sit out a few games so he can rest.  
Giving the top spot to AD would also be better at this point.  
LeBronto had a great career, its about time he takes a more secondary role to a dude on his best years.  
I dont think his ego would ever allow that thou. || This is correct. Laker fans are like Cowboy fans. Even after a shitty year the attitude is “ Well there’s next year” for that I do respect the fans. || You don't even have to look at the knicks lol, the Lakers were shit ever since Kobe tore his Achilles, but they were fine even after their superstar left.

Being part of the Lakers org in the 21st century is playing on easy mode. They'd still make money after a lot of 24-58 seasons, and you can wander around aimlessly for nearly a decade and then LeBron fucking James drops in your lap. || Agreed in general. Im interested specific thing. Without LeBron’s impact, which again make the franchise competitive and idk famous again, do you think the Buss family would have been forced to sell a part of the team to stay competitive? Or would their business have been fine regardless? || My boss (who is a casual fan of hockey and Premier League, and probably couldn’t name more than the 3-4 top athletes in football, baseball, and basketball) went to LA this winter with his wife for a four day long weekend/respite from Canadian winter. They went to a Lakers game because it’s “the thing to do when you’re in LA.” || > Jeannie is a “poverty” owner compared to Balmer

Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2024-12-08,nbadiscussion,1ha6fvi,What will the 2028 US Olympic team look like ,"People aren’t talking about how much pressure the 2028 team is going to face. The game continues to grow globally and more players from overseas are coming to the NBA. We already saw how Siberia or France almost beat us and the fact that the Olympics are going to take place in LA are going to cause a lot of pressure for the 2028 team to win it all

In terms of the 2024 team Lebron, KD, Steph, and Holiday are all going to be retired by then, I feel with his injury history AD will probably not be in the best shape in 2028 when he’s gonna be 35, same goes for Joel Embid, and I don’t know if Derrick White will do another Olympics considering we won gold and he’s gonna be 34 by then. That’s 7 spots that need to be replaced by then. The locks for 2028 assuming they don’t have a Derrick Rose level injury that alters their career I’m assuming are 

Jayson Tatum: This one doesn’t need much of an explanation. He didn’t play well this past Olympics but he’s gonna be 30 by 2028 and he’s Jayson Tatum 

Anthony Edwards: Again doesn’t need much explanation. Will be 27 by the next Olympics

Devin Booker: Will be 32 by the 2028 and I’d argue was the 3rd most impactful player for us in Paris 

Chet Holmgren: Chet will be the perfect fit for team USA because he won’t command the ball a ton. He’ll lock down the paint and can space the floor when asked. Not to mention Chet could develop even more before 2028 considering he’s only 22 at the moment

Paolo Banchero: I’m really high on Paolo and I feel like his inclusion on the 2028 team could be like Ant on this year’s team. I also feel like Paolo will be a top 10 player by this point if he doesn’t suffer a career altering injury so he would have to be on this team

Bam Adebayo: We’re gonna need another center outside of Chet and I’m confident Bam will still be good in 2028

Jalen Brunson: Would provide a good scoring punch and has a winning mentality. Would also be 32 by 2028 which means he could serve as a veteran leader 

Cade Cunningham: The Pistons are a terrible basketball team but Cade is a future star in my opinion. He’s averaging 22, 8, and 8 this year so I feel like either him or Brunson will be the starting PG in 2028

These are the only players that I would say are locks at the moment. That gives 4 spots that are open for players to earn. My question is 1. do you think my locks are good, and 2. who will make up the last 4 spots on the team. My prediction would be Tyrese Haliburton, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley, and Cooper Flagg/AJ Dybantsa. Tyrese Haliburton hasn’t had a great year but I’m still high on him as a player and think he’s a top 25 player in the league. Jalen Suggs would be in the Derrick White role as a role player who defends at a high level and can hit a 3 here and there. Evan Mobley will play center at moments when Chet or Bam need to rest, and Cooper/AJ is going to be in the young guy role that Tyrese had in Paris (if it’s Cooper I could see him playing more because of his defensive floor)

I also want to point out I would have put Jaylen Brown on here but unfortunately with the whole situation between him and Nike/Team USA I don’t feel like their gonna pick him with all that drama. Anyways leave your thoughts in the comments ",20,52,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ha6fvi/what_will_the_2028_us_olympic_team_look_like/,2024-12-09 05:00:16,"Jalen Williams will be on the 2028 US Men’s team I promise. He is a versatile do-it-all player that can guard 1-5 and has no ego. He has been one of the best players in the league this season on both ends of the ball and that’s still 3 1/2 years away from the next Olympics. By the time we get to 2028, JDub could be a top 10 player in the league. He’s super underrated on the national scale in my opinion. Playing as the second option behind perennial MVP candidate, SGA, will do that to you. If there’s been one silver lining to Chet’s injury, it’s been the blossoming of Jalen Williams. He’s improved in every major statistic. And his defense this year is other worldly. He averages 2.1spg. He is peak positionless basketball and could easily be a key asset to achieving gold in 2028. || Think the starting lineup will probably look something like Ja-Ant-Jalen Williams-Tatum-Chet. Ja is likely going to be the best American PG at that point in time (I don’t know what the likelihood is of Brunson still being this good in 4 years considering how small PGs tend to age into their 30s). There is no way Tyrese Haliburton is on this team if he continues to play the way he has for the last year. Could definitely see a guy like Steph Castle get picked to play that Jrue/Derrick White kind of role.

Definitely think guys like Jalen Johnson and Amen Thompson will be in the mix as well. Good players who can play a role off the bench. || Serbia, not Siberia. Spain, Canada, Australia, Greece, Slovenia, Lithuania, Argentina, Germany, France, Turkey etc. Basketball is worldwide sporta, second to football/soccer. 


Once again Jalen Williams got ignored. People still do not count on him and he is in shadow for OKC, but he is elite two way frontcourt player, delivering in all aspects of the game. He has quality now to be member of Team USA and there we can mentioning as candidates Evan Mobley, Memphis Grizzlies core, Scottie Barnes, Trae Young, Jalen Johnson, Herro, LaMelo, Brandon Miller, Mark Williams, Maxey, Kessler, Castle, Zion, Murphy, Herb Jones, Fox, Podziemski, Amen Thompson, Sheppard, MPJ, newcomers like Boozer, Harper plus many others you mentioned or others. 


 
Too early || Most of these will make it but where they will all want to commit I’m not so sure.

Paolo, Bam, Chet, Evan Mobley, Booker, Ant-Man, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Williams, Cade Cunningham, Cam Thomas, Cooper Flagg, Jalen Suggs…wildcard Zion if he’s not 400lbs by 2028. || 1. Your locks are good, except for Brunson. I would rather pick another elite role player.


2. I would add Haliburton as Brunson replacement, Suggs, Jalen Williams, Cooper Flagg, and Evan Mobley.


Honestly the US are probably still fine. Kerr isn’t coaching anymore, so hopefully it’s gonna be Spo and I trust Spo to not get outcoached. If they’re not being outcoached then they’re not being beaten by any team unless US decides to be fucking lazy. Then there’s the US’s very deep talent pool. Nobody beating the team when we got 5 nba caliber players at all times playing suffocating defense and outhustling every other team. || [removed] || Siberia? Really dude? Reaaally? Lmao

The US will win the Gold in an absolute canter, *again*, and everything will be fine. || I wouldn't count Lebron James out just yet..he might have a couple of years left in the tank and if he wants to play, he plays. || Jaren Jackson is the ideal candidate for the Olympic Roster.

Former DPOY with an insane variety of offensive moves. || Generally I agree. It's possible Haliburton won't have it. It's not to say he's an awful player, but just that there will be someone they like more that year, a role player on a championship, like Derrick White was. That said, they'll probably give him the benefit of the doubt since he was a good team player this last time around.

I'll bet you $1 that Bam Adebayo is not on the Olympic team in 4 years though. || How do you not put Mitchell on the squad?? Also fingers crossed cooper flagg comes to save us after losing kd LeBron and steph || It doesn't mattery, y'all won't even get a bronze medal. Remember what I said. This new generation of US players is not beating Germany, Serbia, France, Canada and Australia. Y'all won't get into semi finals. US has always played really bad when we talk about team basketball, but they always had the individual quality to simply score more threes and points in general than their opponents, and there are no more killers like MJ, Barkley, Kobe, LeBron, Wade, Curry, KD, these new kids from US are nowhere near the level of the best Euro guys, and that's the reason why they won't be able to win. It was obvious even on the last Olympics, Serbia played A LOT better team basketball than US basketball team, but as I said, individual quality of LeBron and Curry took over the control of the game and they simply scored more points. Not Ant, not Tatum, not Adebayo, not White, not Haliburton, not Booker, not AD. International teams were always better tactically and strategically than US, and all those international teams are on the same level, if not better when we talk about individual quality. So yeah, it's over for US basketball. I'm putting my money on Serbia next Olympics. || Evan Mobley would actually be a better fit than the Donvovn Cliangan/Derrick Lively pick I made LOL. Mobley is a PF but could reasonably be the 3rd center for 2028. I also thought about J-Dub but I feel he needs to develop more beyond being a scorer before he’s team USA worthy (probably the most underrated player in the league at them moment though) || Can I ask why you have Hali over Brunson given the way he's been playing this year || 

With Lebron/Curry/KD not playing how is France not the favorite in 2028? USA next gen talent is just not the same as France. || JDub & Cade are both better than more than half of that first list and Mobley is a better fit than at least 3 of those players. I would put Herro, Kessler, and Zion in the contenders list. || [removed] || Develop more beyond being a scorer? I wouldn’t even call him that in the first place. He has zero weaknesses and is improving rapidly year over year. He went from 1.1 steals per game last year to 2.1. Blocks went up too. If the season ended today, he deserves a spot on an all-defense team. Every major statistic has gone up. He absolutely deserves a spot || Jdub can do everything on the floor. 3 level scorer, good playmaker, can defend 1-5. There are no holes in his game. He’s better than Jalen Suggs, Cooper Flagg, Devin Booker or Tyrese Haliburton. || Based on what I’ve seen from both of them in the FIBA/Olympics. I like Hali’s pass-first mentality over Brunson’s scoring. There’s already too many scorers on the team. || Lol who are you guys fielding? Coulibaly, Risacher, Salaun, Sarr, Yabusele, Wemby are the only competent players you can play, and even then Wemby’s the only all star there. Gobert, Batum, Fournier will be washed. Too many young guys who are at best NBA role players.


Meanwhile, USA can field Edwards/Booker/Tatum/Bam/Chet with Haliburton/Flagg/Mobley off the bench. Not to mention guys like Banchero, Smith Jr., Thompson twins, B. Miller, and other guys who played for USA Select Team.


Face it lil bro talent gap is still there lol || As a non-American, I can still safely say that the US will be a comfortable favourite to win gold provided they bring their A team & take it seriously. Which they have been doing when they redeemed themselves after having their pants pulled down in Athens.

France should be their closest threat, based on the talent level of players that are projected to be good in 2028. All other nations face their own question marks. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || “Competent”? What a foolish comment. Those are NBA players. The talent gap amongst amateurs is massive but between top level professionals, it absolutely is closing. USA needed 3 generational talents to close out Semi and Final. 

You talk about talent gap but how big is that talent gap between Steph/KD/Lebron compared to Tatum/Ant/Book? Don’t be silly brother.

Also, NBA achievements mean nothing in FIBA competition so to see you mention “all star” is laughable😂😂😂 || It’s a little scary. None of these team USA guys are elite elite.  Team USA will go from being prohibitive favorites with the absolute best players to in the mix with 3-4 other countries. || 1. It is not foolish to say that those dudes are competent but you need more than competent players to overcome the talent diff that team USA has. They cannot catch up to Ant, Book, Tatum, Adebayo, Holmgren with Hali, Wallace/Suggs, Flagg, and Mobley off the bench. Nobody cares about talent gap closing. It’s still not enough. You guys haven’t caught up and that’s the reality you have to face. It’s okay buddy. It’s okay to be inferior lol


2. talent gap between steph/kd/bron compared to Tatum/Ant/Book is a lot smaller than the talent gap between the best 2028 French roster and the best 2028 American roster.


3. If you were good enough in English, you’d have known that the way I worded my sentence was pretty nuanced but in case you didn’t pick up on it, I meant that being an all-star means that you are a higher level of player than just being competent, and those all stars are the guys you need to keep up with Team USA. Unfortunately for you guys, only Wemby fits the bill for now. Hoping that Coulibaly, Sarr, and Risacher (they all have decent skills and look okay for now, and I feel like they are in an upwards trajectory) somehow turn into all stars because it would lowkey make the game more exciting. || But who else besides France will challenge them?

It’s borderline impossible to watch most of these teams play. No defense is played until the last two minutes of the game (at times). 

It is so frustrating watching teams throw up so many threes all the time. Obviously it works for some teams but for most it doesn’t. There are easy dunks being given up for three pointers now. Make dunks 3 points f it (kidding… i mean…)

There are way too many games that don’t matter at all. There is so much talent in the NBA that isn’t used properly. True superstars aren’t even playing the entire season because they don’t want to get hurt (which I understand). You rarely see one player taking over games like they used to when i used to watch the NBA. Players like Carmelo Anthony, Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce, John Wall, Rip Hamilton, heck even Danny Granger used to take over games. 

MAKE THE SEASON 60 GAMES!! Yes I’m a season shortener advocate… so what... What’s your solution to the problem?

I watched my first euro league game the other day and it was the first non-playoff basketball game that I’ve watched that was tolerable. Less standing around waiting for a drive and kick out, and more moving the ball to get the best shot possible. It was actually a fun game. Why can’t we have a euro league champion vs. NBA champion at the end of the season. People would actually watch that. And don’t give me the excuse that nobody would watch it with the marketing team that the NBA has in 2024. The NBA marketing team makes you all watch the disaster of what is all-star weekend each year (guilty). 

NCAA basketball is a joke. The team with the most Juniors and Seniors always win because the schools that a bunch of younger guys on it can’t even run pick and roll properly because the bigs always want to pop or have bad footwork and special recognition. Although i do like that now the transfer system is different and there’s no penalty to transferring schools.

Just find something to enjoy, this is a normal take as you age 🙏 || You need to check out this Rockets Thunder Cup game.  All there was, was defending all over and dudes coached and playing hard. || Sorry, but this take is just ignorant. Year after year, better basketball is played in the NBA regular season than in the previous.

If you take a minimal effort and look at all 5 defenders for a posession, you will see that they work harder and move more than ever, making peel switches and fan out rotations look easy. Those things were revolutionary in the most interesting PO battles 4-5 years ago, and now most teams do it in most regular season games.

Superstar not taking over games? We had Jokic score 100+ in a weekend, Luka is 30-10 most nights. Even lower tier stars like Fox can go for 50. When Granger and those guys ""took over the game"" they scored 35. Embiid averages that every single night (when playing...).

To me, it looks like the product on the court is better than ever. It's your expectations and taste that's changed over the past 10 years, and if 2012 NBA were played today, you wouldn't even follow the sport. If you don't believe me, put on a rendom game from those years, and tell me if you enjoyed it. || I was so hooked on basketball 2 years ago and I can’t even watch a game today but the sad part is I don’t know why. I even looked up why the ratings declined so hard and I still don’t know why. Why do I feel so uninterested? || I think the NBA should just split up the spring and the fall parts of the season. Instead of having one 20**-20\*\*+1 (2024-2025) season, just have 2024 Fall, 2025 Spring, 2025 Fall, 2026 Spring, etc. Then, have two playoffs and two trophies. The NBA Cup is just the playoffs for the fall league.

This shortens the seasons, keeps games relevant, and gives fans more to be excited about. || Much easier to launch 3s than work for a better shot.

Also, working for a better shot might mean battling your Fortnite buddies, and nobody wants to do that. || Yeah 82 games I love.  The cream really rises to the top. || Less opportunities to win = better basketball played. Less injuries to superstars from overworking the bodies so frequently = watching the best of the best battle it out more frequently. Those are just two reasons off the top of my head. || Or when people give takes like this, they really love the NBA, they tune in to watch a game, and are disappointed. Happened several times over the last couple years to me when a game isn’t an NBA cup game or playoffs. || Now that you mentioned it I can recall a couple times that I heard the same thing. Although I do think that shortening the season even 10 or 15 years ago would have had similar benefits as it would today || But why was that? It wasn’t just a regular season game with no incentive to win || The 2 teams shot 6-37 from 3 in the 1st half. Thought I was watching a high school game. || I agree that this is the most developed and statistically best form of basketball. That doesn’t take away from the fact that I will enjoy a random pistons vs. hornets game more today than ten years ago (although i do really like Lamelo and Cade’s games but its just an example). There’s no incentive to winning that random game. Make that game have value, and you will get better basketball. How do we do that? NBA cup did that. But what would make that value more consistent is a shortened season. 

I meant more second tier superstars when i said that sentence (shouldn’t have put Melo in that sentence, my mistake). But taking from your example, Fox should 100% be getting similar numbers and respect as Drose and Westbrook were getting 10 years ago… hence why I don’t think this style of play benefits the majority of talented players nowadays. || NBA viewership tends to do better when there’s a dynasty that everyone is watching. This level of parity has been a buzz kill for the playoffs. Not only has there been a different NBA champion since 2019, but every single reigning champion has failed to make the conference finals since. || The ratings will always be “good enough” for ESPN and TNT to spend millions on NBA games… until that changes, unfortunately nothing will change. || That’s an interesting take. At that point make the fall part count towards playoff standings for the spring part || In most cases that is the best shot. Which is why coaches, management and players want those shots. || > Less opportunities to win = better basketball played.

Shooting 3s is the best basketball mathematically || I think with fewer games you'll get more 3's. Teams mirror what works and analytics and recent champs show that shooting a ton of 3's is a winning strategy. So if you have fewer games, you'd likely see even more 3's. || >Less injuries to superstars from overworking the bodies so frequently 

Guys in the 90s played as many games, in a month less span, flying coach, eating fast food and getting drunk every night...

Somehow, their bodies weren't overworked.

Only now, when athletes are bigger and stronger and faster, are athletes bodies not capable of holding up to... Exactly the same schedule they've played for decades, only with far less nutritional concern or mental health wellness.

It's an odd phenomenon. Mentally, they're just not built like they used to be. || So you're admitting you don't watch the games. 

Opinion discarded. || Idk, I’ve casually tried to get into the NFL for like 4 years straight and probably half the games I’ve tuned into have been complete duds. I think that’s just the nature of sports.

I used league pass + YouTubeTV (for access to my local teams + other sports) and I can almost always find great games. Tonight’s lineup isn’t the best but tomorrow is the IST finals, and Thursday is very good.

Thunder vs. Magic - two teams that love defense and always play hard. 1st and 3rd best defensive teams.

GSW vs. Grizzles - they’ve had a low key rivalry for a few years and Grizzlies are the 2 seed. 5th and 6th best defensive teams. Their matchups are always intense.

Clippers vs. Mavs - another low key rivalry. Clippers are dogs this year even though they lack star talent.

Knicks vs. Wolves - a feisty matchup since the trade. I don’t think either team will treat this game lightly, especially after the jawing in their earlier matchup. Wolves have the 4th best defense BTW.

Hawks vs. Spurs, Pacers vs. Suns, Nuggets vs. Blazers, and Lakers vs. Kings are a bit more iffy but any of them could get exciting if they’re close. || That's the point.  The introduction of the NBA Cup was a way to help make more of the games in November and December matter and get players to give a crap.

I don't think shortening the season and thereby increasing the win variance is an incentive to players to play harder or take less 3s or play better coached defense. || This is the 3rd year in a row Fox is posting almost the exact numbers DRose had in his MVP year.

There was never more incentive to win a random basketball game. Do you think in 2014, a random Horet Pistons game was more important, players cared more about winning it? I see your point in making the regular season more meaningful, and generally agree (although I think this is more of an outdate view at the moment, since the PI, every regular season was a nailbiter from start to finish for most teams), but I don't understand it in the context of comparing eras of the NBA. || > NBA viewership tends to do better when there’s a dynasty that everyone is watching. This level of parity has been a buzz kill for the playoffs.

Give it time. I stopped watching basketball when there was no parity, and even my team's regular playoff appearances had zero chance of materializing a championship back in the mid 00s. Now I'm back because parity is starting to return, and I think it's only going to get better. There are two totally different types of fans I guess. I like competition and teamwork, not so much the spectacle of the individual or the superhero. || Also, another idea: make the NBA development league most active in the summer, so you could have a nice three seasons of basketball: Summer (development), Fall (season leading to NBA Cup), Spring (new season with fresh standings leading to NBA Finals in April/May). || Maybe?

Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2024-12-27,nbadiscussion,1hogf1q,Mock Early All-Star Rosters,"I was thinking today about how stacked the league is in terms of individual talent, and how there will be quite a few guys getting snubbed from the all-star rosters this year.

I tried to put together some early rosters based on my opinions and my estimates of how voting will go. I'll also include some notable snubs.

East:

G: **Jalen Brunson** - Bonafide superstar after last year with the New York market to back him up.

G: **Donovan Mitchell**- Best offensive player/most marketable player on a team on pace for 70+ wins.

F: **Jayson Tatum** - Known commodity having an excellent season

F: **Giannis Antetokounmpo** - Superstar arguably having his best individual season, likely best player in the east, leads the league in scoring and Bucks are hot.

C: **Karl Anthony-Towns** - With Embiid being in and out of the lineup KAT is likely the best center in the east, and he's been playing amazing as he meshes into new surroundings. Also has the New York Market.

B1: **Damian Lillard** - Popular vet having a great season.

B2: **Jaylen Brown** - Last year's Finals MVP who will lose his shit if he gets snubbed again after the Olympics.

B3: **Trae Young** - Trae is back to proper All-Star form after a few down years missing the weekend.

B4: **Evan Mobley** - Young big who has made the leap into a versatile legit weapon on both ends.

B5: **LaMelo Ball** - Honestly I'm not too sure about this one, he's averaging thirty but he is typically made out of glass so I think it will depend on how many games he plays in the coming weeks.

B6: **Cade Cunningham** - Young budding star with great counting stats and who's impressive maturity has helped turn Detroit around immensely.

B7: **Darius Garland** Great player on a team that I think deserves to get three guys into the game.

**EASTERN SNUBS** (in no particular order)

Tyler Herro,
Tyrese Haliburton,
Pascal Siakam,
Jimmy Butler,

I'd probably put Tyrese Maxey, Derrick White, RJ Barrett, Jarrett Allen, Jalen Johnson and Tyler Herro first up for injury reserves.

**WEST:**

G: **Shai-Gilgeous Alexander** - On here for obvious reasons

G: **Luka Doncic** - See above

F: **LeBron James** - Ah, this is a tricky one. Obviously fucking LeBron James will be an all-star game starter. And is he an all-star caliber player? Yes. Does every all-star caliber player get to be in the all-star game in the year 2024? No. Does LeBron objectively deserve to be an all-star starter this year? Probably not.

F: **Victor Wembanyama** - Everyone knew it was only a matter of time before this guy was at the very top of the league in terms of production, and here we are.

F: **Nikola Jokic** - An absurd basketball player

B1: **Anthony Davis** - The Lakers have a lot of problems, and Anthony Davis is only one of them sometimes. One of the biggest names in the league, he will be in the All-Star game.

B2: **Anthony Edwards** - Edwards has had a... weird season thus far. He has all but abandoned his athletic interior game to chick up threes on ridiculous efficiency. But is that what the Wolves need from him? Probably not. He will also be in the All-Star game.

B3: **Jaren Jackson Jr** - The Memphis Grizzlies are second in the West, so naturally I hear nothing about them ever. I was surprised to see that Jackson Jr. is their leading scorer. Maybe a Memphis fan can explain their success despite Ja and Bane having down years statistically. (Especially Bane, wtf is happening there?)

B4: **Kevin Durant** - Kevin Durant will be in the NBA All-Star game

B5: **Stephen Curry** - I honestly don't believe Curry deserves a spot this year, but see my entries for KD and Bron for an explanation.

B6: **Alperen Sengun** - Sengun is probably having a worse individual year than last year when at time she was heralded as the second coming of Jokic, but the Rockets have shot right to the top of the West this year and need a guy in the big game. I figure it should be Sengun, but again I literally never hear anything about the Rockets outside of Reddit and am not totally sure who their main guy is considering it seems that they have pretty consistent production across the roster and their top scorer Jalen Green is still the proto-type of AAU ball.

B7: **Kyrie Irving** - The last spot in the West was a tough decision. I gave it to Kyrie because he is having a great year, the Mavs are near the top of the West, he's coming off of a high publicity playoff run, and he is a known commodity in the league.

If you read this far congratulations. This has been a nice way to spend an hour. Let me know what your thoughts are.",96,60,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hogf1q/mock_early_allstar_rosters/,2024-12-28 16:57:33,"I'm really nibbling at the edges here, but snubs implies that they're having a great season and maybe only barely miss out on a spot. It doesn't mean a known good player who's scoring 20 a game or some prior All-Star. Maybe they're honorable mentions or sub All-Stars (a concept from Thinking Basketball), but they're not snubs.


For instance, I find it difficult to believe that the Pelicans get 4 players in the snub category with the worst record in the West. Green, Randle, and Gobert (as much as I liked his contributions with us) are not snubs either. 


Similar for the East. || Anthony Edwards is shooting 3s this season because the starting line up has Gobert, McDaniels, and Randle who all do not give him spacing to play an interior game. || I really agree with these. It's hard to get new blood in the game with all the legacy/ large market picks but that's just part of it for now. 

As a Grizzlies fan, Bane had an oblique injury early in the season and he just now seems to be shaking the rust off. Combine that with playing fewer minutes by design with a deep bench and his numbers are down. I'm not concerned. || I can explain the Memphis situation. JJJ massively improved when he was the only one healthy last season playing with literal G league players as his starting teammates. Ja keeps getting hurt every three games so he has missed a lot and is trying to focus on assisting more. Bane got an injury early season and is just now getting back to form. He was pretty bad for a while though. The Grizzlies are doing so well because during the offseason they fired almost all of the assistant coaches and brought in a ton of new ones. The new offense is all about sharing the ball and playing with the fastest pace in the NBA. Most games even the starters play under 30min because the philosophy is to always have fresh guys in the game. So far the Grizzlies have the best bench in the league and that’s why they keep winning even though Ja and Bane haven’t been at their best. Also drafting two rookies who are top 5 helps. Oh yeah and GG and Vince still haven’t even played yet. (Vince played two games but I’m not counting that.) || If you think Curry doesn’t deserve an Allstar nod this year, I will agree on that. But Allstar game is in San Francisco, his home turf. Plus, he is like top 2 in terms of popularity so I think he will still be an Allstar even though he is regressing. || Jalen Williams has to be in there, OKC are miles ahead in the West and deserve at least 2 All-Stars (and if Chet wasn't injured you could even make a case for 3 All-stars) || I think your East is probably close to what it will be (some of it is easy to predict – the East starters are already pretty much locked up). However, I think it will Herro instead of LaMelo. Coaches reward winning with the reserves. Heat are sixth right now, Hornets thirteenth. Heat will have someone. Bam is having a down year and there’s no way coaches reward Jimmy for whatever is going on with him. And Herro has been great. He’s having a crazy efficient year and has been good enough to deserve it. || I think your east lineup is great. I think Herro might sneak in, but that’s it. 

In the west, I think Harden should be an absolute lock, but because of politics he might miss it. He’s better than Sengun and Kai. Imo Sabonis, Fox, and maybe Book and JDub have also been better than those two. || Harden deserves it. I don’t think Dallas should have 2 all stars. Luka might miss it depending on the severity of his injury. 

As for the East, I don’t think Cleveland will get 3 all stars. I think Hali or Maxey gets in instead of Garland. || Sengun inclusion by a non biased Rockets fan is great to see. His game isn’t as flashy because of the Udokas system, but he’s way more effective overall which has contributed to team success. || Nice breakdown…pretty darn accurate…definitely hope Melo plays the rest of the games till ASG…he’s a joy to watch, makes me chuckle how much fun he’s having 🕊 || Agree with all except for Kyrie, I think JDub and Harden deserve it more than he does rn given that the league normally awards the top teams two all stars like last year with KAT and Ant and that a surprising team like the Clips would normally have an all star especially one thats a house hold name. 

Though I do not hate the selection and understand your reasoning for that || Focused mostly on your East lineup as I’m a Sixers homer. 

Lamelo entertaining AF and has played 22 games, def would keep him in.

I take the all star as popularity / the current season. So don’t care that Brown was finals MVP or would be upset, he’s on outside of the fence for me 

Josh hart as a snub what? 

I’d get Maxey in the mix - otherwise generally like the work (once again, am homer) || LaMelo is not an All-Star!! His team is 7-24. This is the Bradley Beal 2020 situation. 30 PPG on a bottom feeder on bad efficiency is not All-Star worthy. Also noteworthy that Beal shot 45% from the field and LaMelo is shooting 42%. Empty stats. || I agree on all of the above. My heart tells me that Lebron and Durant should be swapped, but I know that is unlikely.

Doesn't mean I won't keep voting for Tyrese and Pascal but after the start we had... Siakam has an argument but it is unlikely. || I will be shocked if Sengun makes the all-star game

He should behind Jalen Williams, Harden, Fox definitely and then probably behind Nooker, Morant and Powell || I would take Trae over Brunson for the first five this year. He is doing great as a playmaker with that young players around him. || Definite agree on curry arguably not deserving it, might put KD over Vic in the starters just due to fan vote and bc he’s still been very good this year || [removed] || [removed] || I’m glad you asked caused I dropped a video 2 weeks ago, a few minor tweaks 

https://youtu.be/MyZcJWoxE_k || Nice list, what shocked me the most is that Jaren Jackson is the leading scorer not Ja Morant! || He won't make it because of the injury, but Cam Thomas at least deserves a mention. || Its pretty crazy how many people don’t realize all star reserves aren’t selected by fan vote || yeah i definitely was rough around the edges with the snubs. forgot to mention i had a low bar for that. to be fair i literally added those three guys right before i posted lol just as an add-on || i will also say that despite narratives and team success, check out randle's shooting splits when you get the chance. his scoring his slightly down but it's not like he some bum already. || Him “chucking up” threes is literally what the wolves need from him lol || What was wrong with the Grizzlies assistant coaches? || Spot on, but I think a lot of Ja's games missed to injury are precautionary this year. || that is what is frustrating about legacy guys eating up spots. you can assume every year that injury will call for replacements. also swap him and kyrie and you get no argument from me.",0.483,0.517,0.0,-0.4215,0.064,0.836,0.1,0.9911,0.095,0.708,0.197,0.9995
Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-01-02,nbadiscussion,1hsutyy,How Did Michael Jordan Handle Double Teams?,"During his break out season last year, Ant Edwards was often compared to a young MJ. Stylistically, in terms of swagger, etc. lots of people saw the comparison. With his recent comments after his game against the Celtics, **""It's not how I want to play, I'm only 23, I don't wanna just be passing the ball all night.”** It got me thinking- how did Michael Jordan respond to double teaming (if he was doubled teamed at all). I'm too young to have watched MJ play and while I'm sure I can watch the highlights I was wondering if: 

* Was MJ doubled as a strategy?
* If he was, was it effective when he was younger? Did he eventually adapt?
* How did he respond? Did he get to his spots regardless or did he make the correct pass?

Appreciate your time!",168,163,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hsutyy/how_did_michael_jordan_handle_double_teams/,2025-01-03 14:32:32,"It worked a bit differently due to the illegal defense rule. He typically made the right pass but someone also would have been more open than they would today. Hard to compare, imo. || Before they changed the illegal defense rules, if teams wanted to double him, they had to leave someone wide open. They weren’t allowed to zone up and hedge like they do now. 

Not to say that he wasn’t doubled, he def was, but it was a riskier move back then and an easier pass to a wide open shot || MJ was difficult to double team because he rarely held the ball, he went into his moves quickly and usually only used 1-3 dribbles to get to his spots. His first step was so fast he didn’t need complicated dribbling moves to get free. The only time he really held the ball was when he posted up, and when the double came he would often spin away from it for a midrange baseline shot. || Everything people are saying about the defensive rules and everything else is true.

But as someone who religiously watched MJ as a kid, I swear all a double team did to him was tell him which way he needed to spin for his unguardable fade away shot in the mid range. I feel like he abused double teams so much that they didn't really do it. Unless you count a double team as the 2nd guy to help after he blew by the first.

I'm not comparing SGA to MJ, except in this respect. If you watch double teams come at SGA, he is so quick that he can just go the other direction and make the defense go into a tails pin. It reminds me of what MJ would do. || Split them or give and go. Jordan didn't stand there with a live dribble sizing up his defender nearly as often. He was catch and go. Straight into his move. || Jordan actually had a bunch of tricks and ways he would punish doubles. 

The most basic was skip passing and finding open players on the weak side. 

He often would use a quick give and go. 

He would sometimes split them off the dribble.

He would also use defenders coming to help as screens against their own teammates.

He would dribble away from the defenders to the other side of the floor and make the double chase him, causing breakdowns in their help and leading to hockey assists. 

He would also just play off-ball and use curls screens. He would throw in backdoors as counters to defenders trying to get in the way of passing angles to him in the post/high post/pinch post. || Another thing to note is that was the beauty of the Triangle at the time. When you are on a sort of 3v3 island, double teaming would require a pretty highly coordinated effort to pull off without leaving someone either absurdly or obviously open. So, you wouldn't really see many doubles for a lot of his career. || I like Ant, I've liked the Wolves since the KG days, and as a Knicks fan I'm finding myself watching and rooting for them more than ever - but the broader discourse needs to take a step back from the Jordan narratives. 

A dude like Jordan didn't blink at double teams. When Jordan was 23 he averaged 37ppg - 8 more ppg than the next player (Dominique), and 7000 more total points. His next best players and top scorers were Oakley (14.5/13/4) and Paxson (11.3/6/2). He also averaged 5asts, 5rebs, 1.5blocks, and 3 steals that year - he'd essentially be neck and neck with Dyson right now, for context. 

If you gave that 23 year old Jordan a team with Gobert, Randle, Naz Reid, McDaniels, Donte, etc there's genuinely a good chance he could steal that first round from the Celtics (best of 5 then) and wind up in the finals. It kinda feels unfair to everyone to even compare Ant, honestly || Back then, you had to be an arm's length away from an offensive player or it would be called illegal defense. You were not allowed to play zone or pre-rotate (position yourself in between 2 offensive players). You could leave your man to go double, but with no rotations, this made it easier for offensive players back then to know who the open man would be. It was likely a guaranteed open shot for the open man because again, there was no rotating. 

The old rules played in favor of dominant 1 on 1 iso players like MJ and Shaq. This is not to discredit them or other great players of earlier eras. As others have said, these guys consistently dealt with being doubled and consistently scored over double teams. Again, my takeaway is the game was much simpler and favored great physical 1 on 1 talents. 

Today, I believe it's more difficult for a great player to carry a team by himself. You really need a solid all around team and bench all in their optimal roles. A great advantage to have today is high IQ and quick decision making w/ crisp passing. There's alot more thinking and complexity involved in today's game. Think of guys like Lebron, Luka, Jokic, and even Draymond surrounded with Klay and Steph who can dissect defenses. || The best thing about MJ was that he was almost always aggressive. His motor was always running. He didn't stand around, linger with the ball (unless it's a designed play). His preference was to crash the rim, get to the basket, make the defender stop him. He was good at passing out of it, and getting the ball back right away. The team had the right scheme to circumvent the double teams.

Also remember that this was the general style of play in the 80's and 90's. Unfortunately, it has largely been lost in today's game. Nowadays, guys will dribble, dribble, dribble and then eventually chuck up a shot, or have to pass it off to someone else. Very few guys will attack the rim with any sort of consistency. Because of this, it's easier to double team and get the offense flustered.

The hand check rule in the 90's allowed for defenders to be more aggressive, so double teams were that much more difficult if you didn't pass the rock.

And sometimes, frankly, you're just better than everyone else and you shoot over them with your patented fade away. || OK, I'm gonna take a stab at this from the ""what did he actually do"" perspective, rather than talking about how double teaming was different back then, which, while true, I think is getting overstated here. In particular, I'm not sure some of y'all understand how illegal defense worked on the ground.

  
MJ did indeed face double teams quite often. You are correct, it was more effective when he was younger. He did adapt as he got older, though I think a lot of that had to do with the team around him getting better. His responses were different depending on which era MJ we are talking, and, more importantly, where he was on the floor/what action he was running when the double came. He both made the correct pass (more often in the 90s than the 80s) and got to his spots regardless.

  
Because Jordan rarely held the ball, he rarely saw doubles in a faceup situation. When this happened, he either attacked the double team, usually to the side of the bigger, slower defender, or passed. If the pass was not to a shooter, he'd quite often cut immediately off that pass. Young MJ had fewer shooters, and was more prone to attacking. 

More commonly, he would beat his defender and draw help. Young MJ was prone to try and finish over the help, quite often successfully I might add, older MJ hit the open man much more often.

Jordan didn't run a ton of pick-and-roll, most likely because when he did the defense usually trapped. Jordan's responses were a) make the pocket pass to the roller, which, while he was good at at that pass, usually resulted in Bill Cartwright bricking an open 15-footer; and b) try and beat the double to the middle of the floor. Might as well just iso and not invite the trap to begin with.

Most of the doubles Jordan saw were when he was posting up. If the double came from a shooter, MJ would usually pass, but most often Jordan would spin away for a baseline fade. If he saw an open cutter while in the air, though, he could and did zip a two-handed pass into the lane for a layup. Despite ""don't jump pass"" being coaching 101 at almost all levels of basketball, he somehow never ever turned it over doing this. || Here is Jordan’s numbers during his short time at point guard -ridiculous 

https://www.si.com/nba/bulls/old-school/michael-jordans-time-as-a-point-guard-during-the-1988-89-nba-season || He would pass 

But he also had an insane ability to be efficient with movement, one or 2 dribbles ... Bucket ..

So he could occasionally beat a double team, get to the bucket before they are able to double or pass || This is why Jordan said the new zone rules would have taken his effectiveness away when they were being discussed after he retired. || Beyond illegal defense and just defensive schemes being wildly different.

MJ was an insanely quick decision maker, he would catch the ball and immediately know what he needed to do and on top of that hes a very very very good passer, not Lebron, Jokic or Magic level but still an elite playmaker.

I dont think Ant should look at someone like MJ on how to break the double, but someone like Kobe, who also notoriously did not like passing to teammates he did not trust despite his BBIQ being very high. Alternatively Shai is also a good playmaker out of the double but nothing insane the relies on being a ""natural"" playmaker. || I was watching game 1 of the 1991 NBA finals the other day, so many times I would see Jordan receive it in the mid post, a second player would start coming in his guarding player would drop a little to to cover the baseline so the second player on his way would cover the paint. Almost Everytime Jordan would use the space as soon as his defender would drop to baseline and before the help defender would get in space, to step from the post into the paint in-between the defenders rise up, hang in the air for like half the shot clock before putting up a shot or occasionally passing to either an open bigman on the baseline or someone on the perimeter. || This video has been floating around YouTube for a while. The answer is MJ attacked and punished double teams. But then again, watching what MJ did and actually doing it are two different things. https://youtu.be/m_nt21y8Xy0?si=YXSlVFFabrz4Unta || It depends on where he was located when the double came. In some cases he’d pass the ball. Others he’d spin away from the double team and shoot. Or he’d evade the double team and then dunk on the Knicks. Under the triangle it was an easy pass to whatever team mate was open. Double team or not he would make you pay. || Ant made an excuse—you don’t have to pass the ball all night. Some players, like Lillard and Harden, are known for giving up the ball easily when double-teamed. Jordan? He didn’t fold that easily. When you doubled him, you couldn’t predict his next move. He refused to let the defense dictate the game. || He was a good passer and he could also dribble through double teams with his fantastic footwork. Some of those highlights against the Knicks come to mind. || I think a better question is how Kobe handled them. And often times, it was *not well*. 


As brilliantly skilled and smart a player he was, he would absolutely get frustrated and force shitty shots. Now in his defense he played with some all time *brutal* teammates after Shaq - teams *starting* Smush Parker, Luke Walton, Chris Mihm, Kwame Brown, Brian Cook, Deavean George, Maurice Evans. 


It was nuts. For all the criticisms about his efficiency, there were many games where literally the only chance they had was Kobe throwing up a bunch of crap and seeing if he could get hot.


Which he didn't exactly hate, lol. The losing, yes, but he was always pretty comfortable putting up a bunch of shitty shots.


But. When they got Fish back, when Odom was healthy and at his peak, when Bynum started to arrive - they had the best record in the league in December before they traded for Pau - people forget that. 


It didn't completely change Kobe's stripes, even with the two championships. He would play selfish at times, dumb at times. He went from one of the best late game players to one of the worst, because everyone knew you could double him and he would still force up the shot. 


Complicated guy. So much good, some bad. Edwards is going to have to figure out the balance of carrying the team but getting the most defensive attention. I'm excited to see. || Someone posted the clip of Bird getting 60 on the Hawks back in 85’ and they were shocked by how few double teams he saw. He was attacking from the baseline and both bigs were just camped in the paint, the other two players weren’t even in the frame. You can’t double that without trying to rotate a smaller player onto a big that’s already in scoring position.

Jordan attacked a defense that wanted to double him in a similar way. Trapping him was effective if you got him early while he was bringing the ball up || Lmao, he doesn't need to deal with it because a lot of plays in the 90s were 1 on 1, illegal defense will fck you up if you keep trying to double team || MJ was a freak of nature athletically, as athletic as ant is he has nothing on MJ. MJ ran something like a 4.35 40 with a 44+ vertical was 6'6 and the strongest wing his size in the league. He could just blast double teams If he had a head of steam going.


They couldn't double much in his day though so I'm not sure teams were very good at it.


Ant comes across as a poor man's Kobe than MJ to me. || do yourself a favour and watch come fly with me and then read up on the jordan rules created by chick daly and implemented by the bad boy pistons.  if MJ was playing today he would have average 50+ || He mostly played off ball and mastered shooting fast when he got the ball in the post before the second defender could close.

Outside that, they'd just park everyone away from him so if you doubled you had a wide open cutter. || Triangle offense was one of the reasons why MJ had success as main option in offense. It triggers ball movement and off ball movement || MJ didn't play like a big where he held the ball and waited for the double team. He made his move quickly before the double team came.  

Sometimes teams would try to blitz or trap him at half court but he would pass out of that.  


The answer is that he was too fast to be effectively doubled. If you've ever seen an MJ highlight real you've seen ""the great escape"" play where he went Baseline, was trapped by Starks and Oakley and he spun off them to dunk over Ewing. 1991 playoffs. || Something I’m not seeing here. Illegal defense was a thing in the 80s-90s you pretty much had to watch a man play 1 v 1 or give a super obvious hard double that the player could pass out of. 

Go watch some of those possessions where it’s one guy and his defender on the left wing area and the other 8 guys just standing shoulder to shoulder 

Nba defenses today are orders of magnitude more complicated than anything jordan ever saw || First, I would highly recommend the following YouTube Channel:  https://youtube.com/@mj23haf?si=F1krFz7WfppZqP2y.  This dude does a phenomenal job of creating high quality MJ highlight reels for each game.

Secondly, there are many “MJs.”  I would break them down as a young, frenetic MJ (1984-1990), a solid jump shooting MJ who was perimeter oriented, put into a team system (the triangle), but worked predominately outside-in while maintaining his athleticism and ability to finish at the basket (91-93), and then the 96-98 MJ who was a jump shooter/post player, predominately.

Young MJ would run around double teams, occasionally passing to his teammates, but preferring to beat the double team on his own, as he had 0 faith in his teams.  He tended to do this by either literally jumping over the defense (which he did a great deal in his first years) or by running past both defenders.

91-93 was much more apt to pass to the open man, most notably John Paxson.  1991 Game 5 of the Finals is emblematic of this evolution.  

Finally, 96-98 Jordan had the ball in the post much more.  While not as physically exciting, this was more cerebral and equally exciting, IMO.  His first move tended to be a fadeaway away from the double team.  He kept defenses guessing by the fading away to the opposite side, most of the time before the double team would get there.  Finally, he would use these moves to setup a move towards the basket.  He rarely used the same move twice and tended to use each move to setup the next.

I don’t recall him ever complaining about double teams.  The one complaint that I do recall was the physical style of play, which he found to be an affront to the game.  I’m sure he didn’t like getting his ass kicked either (though he responded to this by working out and putting on ~15 pounds of muscle.

If you want specific game example, let me know.  I’ve been watching the dude for 40 years … and am still learning from him 😂",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.009,0.892,0.099,0.9174,0.081,0.777,0.142,0.9996
Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-01-11,nbadiscussion,1i0422g,Where to find data on which players face the most of different defensive coverages?,"Something that I do not see discussed enough is how different defensive coverages impact players statistics and also by extension the gravity that players create for the rest of their teammates through that defensive coverage. In the NFL, we talk about how great RBs force teams to bring extra players into the box and what that does to make other parts of the offense easier. In addition, we talk about how a star RB like Saquon on the Giants did not have great YPC numbers but faced structures of defenses that were slanted to him and thus the context of how often he could gain yards much higher as an example. 

The reason that I am asking this question is that Anthony Edwards stats this season have taken a step back in many ways outside of his 3 point shooting. However, something that teams are doing more and more especially after the Mavs exposed the Wolves in the playoffs last season are hard double teams immediately on catch, face guarding the entire floor, and even double teams with other players hedging at the elbows to stop drives. In last night’s game the Grizzlies were face guarding Ant even if he didn’t cross half court leading to possessions where the Wolves were literally playing 4-4 or even 4-3 or close to it. 

This is, in part, to Edwards playing a lot of minutes with Gobert and McDaniels and Julius Randle. Tradtionally, one outlet for 2 on the ball is passing to the big in the short role and creating a 4-3 situation that leads to (1) open 3 point shots (2) the big with an advantage attacking a smaller help defender (3) open cutters/lobs if the help steps up. Or teams leave open 3 point shooters who are 1-2 passes away that can lead to easy 3 point looks and defenses in rotation. The problem is Gobert is one of the worst players in this role in the league — and struggles to catch the ball let alone be a threat to score or make passes to 3 point shooters. And McDaniels has shot under 30% on wide and wide open shots taking among the most of these in the league. 

I would like to see how often Ant, and other players are double teamed and how much gravity in terms of defensive coverage that he draws. And I would also like to see how he compares to other players. I think this would add another dimension to NBA discourse that would lead to interesting discussions and a better understanding of how good offensive players are and their offensive impact. 

However, I can barely find data out there about this and none from this year. Does anyone know where to find this? ",13,4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i0422g/where_to_find_data_on_which_players_face_the_most/,2025-01-12 21:42:27,"There was a twitter post about off ball and on ball gravity some time ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/1ht0jro/chart\_of\_basketball\_indexs\_offball\_and\_onball/](https://www.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/1ht0jro/chart_of_basketball_indexs_offball_and_onball/)

Ant is basically in the middle section with Shai, Franz, Young. This measures ""gravity"", although not entirely sure exactly how the data for this works, also does not show doubles but im pretty sure its accounted for.

 However, something that teams are doing more and more especially after the Mavs exposed the Wolves in the playoffs last season are hard double teams immediately on catch, face guarding the entire floor, and even double teams with other players hedging at the elbows to stop drives.

I also really disagree with this. Ant started getting doubled and trapped by Phoenix during the regular season and that carried over to Minnesota's sweep, with Ant tearing their doubles to shreds. Denver then played him in single converage until game 5, in which Ant was still pretty good in game 5 and 6, specially game 6. Late in game 6 he took a really hard fall on his back and did not look the same in game 7, but managed to be effective on defense and hit some big shots.

In the Dallas series they doubled him, but it was more successful for 2 primary reasons; 1st they put a guy like DJJ and PJ on doubles, both of which are good, athletic and long defenders with then Lively sitting back as the main rim protector and 2nd because KAT shot 38% from the field for the series. Ant had horrible games 1 and 2, but by game 3 was largely himself from the Denver series.

The double team was not the primary reason for Minnesota losing, it was their inability to stop the Luka Doncic PnR, coupled with timely shot making from the Mavs and disastrous game management from the Wolves late in the game.

The reason Ant's playmaking looks so bad is because his release valve is not KAT anymore and he is one of the leagues best play finishers. I'd argue that Ant's main issues are not his playmaking, but his lack of attention and awareness on off-ball defense and his missing midrange game to punish defenses from overplaying the 3 or the drive. || You used to be able to get some of this (like the double team stuff) on NBA's CourtOptix but it looks like they killed that after the 2023 season. 

Synergy might have it if you can find someone with an account to share with you, but their baseline level stats do not have anything built into it like ""how much gravity"" a player has, or the ability to dictate that a player is why a certain coverage was used as opposed to a different player, or their overall team, or just the opposing team's decision to mix something up due to the defensive personnel they have in.

For instance a team may opt to play more zone with their bench in sometimes, or if they're not playing a true five, or if they're having a problem stopping drives. You would have to hand track that and be sure of that being the reason why before that could be used as a stat. Even with doubles you can run into an issue of questioning if a player is getting doubled because they're that good, or is it because they fold under the pressure and will cough up the ball, or if it's just a different look for a defense trying to throw stuff out there, or if a team always wants to double from the top on a player if they receive the ball on the side of the court where going away from that uses them to use their off-hand, so on and so forth.

Just a really tricky thing to try and create valuable data for. || You have to pay a good amount of money for that kind of data. Basketball is a much smaller court and not everything can be neatly compartmentalized. || I’d like to see the raw data. And I know this is hard to track. I don’t see other players like Shai or even Brunson getting the same attention that Ant does. But maybe it’s the lack of release valves that Ant has and the fact he has to at times try to force his way through that compounds. 

I agree with your other discussion points. I don’t think the issue is Ant’s playmaking, I think it’s lack of release valves and his inconsistent midrange game. He doesn’t have the ability to play with his own pace and get into the middle of the floor and floater range and this makes it tough for him because he has to get all of the way to the rim and if he does turn the corner from the double team teams have time to get help there. And a few other wrinkles that make things hard because of the types of doubles teams can send without worrying about the Wolves punishing them. They can send 2 on the ball from up top with wings and still leave their center at the rim because they don’t care about Gobert, McDaniels and to a lesser extent Randle. 

As for exposed, I meant the Wolves offense I don’t mean to say that’s why they lost alone. In addition, I agree that PHX did this too but the Wolves release valves in that series were making shots and PHX didn’t have a rim protector that could stop Ant from getting to the rim. He also was on one his hit stretches from the mid range in both series… but part of this is the lack of athleticism from the defenders and the comfortability he was able to get into the mid range without traffic",0.0,0.905,0.095,0.0935,0.079,0.798,0.123,0.9437,0.109,0.771,0.119,0.9394
Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-01-15,nbadiscussion,1i2xnfs,How important was the DeAnthony Melton injury to the collapse of the Warriors' season,"For the first few weeks of the season, the Warriors were balling, they were phenomenal and the defense and offence were singing. They started the season 2nd in defence. But over the course of the season, Buddy Hield cooled off and the offence has cooled off. The defence has also dropped to 9th. 

While lots of people point to the Hield drop off, my instinct was that Melton was incredibly important to the Warriors. He was hitting threes at a good clip and was a really good guard defender, the true 3 and D archetype. The Warriors don't have that look next to Curry anymore in the backcourt anymore. 

How much do you guys agree with my assessment?",23,18,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i2xnfs/how_important_was_the_deanthony_melton_injury_to/,2025-01-16 14:52:50,"Melton missed half the games during the opening stretch. Sure he could’ve flipped some of the close finish games around but streaky shooting was the main reason for the hot start || We were overachieving against a weak schedule. Injury did not help at all but what was going on was not sustainable and was largely contingent on buddy hield shooting like peak Klay on one of his monthlong heaters. Kerr also did a very good job planning for the season with limited/flawed players. Problem is that when teams started to adjust there is not much he can do because we aren’t very good from a talent perspective outside of 30 and 23 it’s mostly just a bunch of role players who are one dimensional with serious flaws in their games. 

I will say that a healthy gp2 and melton with a focused/motivated Draymond behind them was nasty defensively. || Not especially, with one exception.

As noted, the Warriors had an easy schedule to start, the only exception being the games against the Rockets and Clippers in their first seven games.

After that, they managed to beat Boston, OKC, Dallas, and Memphis, with Melton getting hurt during that Dallas game.

The one exception I would say is that the one game that made me (and maybe other Warriors fans) believe in the start the team had was that OKC game, which is nearly the *only* real game the Warriors got where Melton played as the backcourt partner to Steph and it all clicked.

Melton, in that game, went for 19/10/2 with 3 steals and shot 5/8 from 3. He was connective, took the lead defensive assignment, disrupted on defense, and just *fit*.

So, I do think the Warriors fall-off (especially defensively) would have been very much helped by Melton still playing for them, but it's not like he was the *reason* they were winning early on. || Not at all important. Buddy Hield was playing like an All Star during that stretch, it wasn’t sustainable. But that’s just imo || He missed a few games from that hot stretch, but I agree with you. He was the backup point guard and could play with or without Steph with solid defense. The collapse isn't all because of his injury, but I feel like it was a big part of it. || Well he definitely competed lineups

But ultimately the real issue is we stopped running the offence we had at the start of the year when Melton got hurt and I don't know why. || Dude the warriors were always going to taper off that hot stretch. Buddy was shooting st a crazy clip for a sec. It wasn’t sustainable. They don’t have enough people that can create for themselves in crunch time || Wiggins, Moody, Hield, Kuminga were all shooting at \~50% from 3. It was never sustainable especially when you look at career averages. || Has nothing to do with anything it's about warriors not having a coach the dude is one of the worst... Only reason he has a job is because of the Steph Clay and Dreymond || The first 8 games, Hield averaged 21 on 69 TS% || Buddy Hield was shooting over 50% from three for the first 10 games or so. The whole team (except Podz) was shooting exceptionally well. The defense was also really good over that time.

Then, predictably, players started to get hurt. GP2 was in and out of the lineup. Draymond missed games. Melton was done for the season. The shooting came back down to earth. Steph had a few terrible games. It just kind of all fell apart.

This is who the Warriors were always going to be this season. They don't have the personnel to generate offense without Steph. Steph is incredible, but he's 37, and he will have his ups and downs as well as missing games here and there. The team is undersized. Draymond by himself can make any defense decent. When he's off the floor though, the defense isn't nearly as good.

This team isn't going to turn into the 2022 Warriors any time soon. They just don't have the players for that. Their ceiling is mediocre. || Through the first 8 games, Hield averaged 21 on 69 TS% || Sure, but we stopped running most of the offensive sets we were running before Melton got injured and defaulted into kerrs bread and butter split offence which the entire league knows now. || I can't say for sure this isn't a contributing factor. It's just that when you shoot ridiculously well from three, it makes your offense look great. When you shoot poorly from three, that same offense looks terrible.

I watch these games and see Steph generating wide open looks for his teammates. In the beginning of the season, they made them. Then, they started missing them. That's the main thing I'm seeing.

And some stupid turnovers (par for the course for GS) and worse defense. || I mean being such a terrible layup and FT shooting team is obviously affecting us (costing us like 4pts per game compared to league average)

But I think the reason we such so much when steph is off the floor is we run the same predictable actions without steph tk actually throw off the other team. At least running a standard pnr would actually create an advantage for our ball handler. || That's definitely an issue too.

My stats were taken from StatMuse, NBA.com and Basketball Reference.

I took some of the best scorers of our time, clearly the most prolific ones such as MJ, Kobe Harden ( a well known free throw marchant), Doncic and LeBron averaged just the same free throw attempts as SGA yet they're not called free-throw marchants although when watching games James and Doncic tend to flop.

 Considering that most of SGA scoring attempts are either the ISO or Drive especially with his weird playing style a lot of defenders tend to lean their bodies more into SGA and he also initiates a lot of contact in order to get some space in his shot creation but it seems a lot of his critics do not actually watch his games and also don't bring up actual stats like I have. This is r/NBA discussion so I'm down to have people refute my stats and facts by having a debate like thoughtful individuals. Peace to you all.

Much easier to do mental gymnastics that way. If you cite averages, they'll say he foul baits more against good teams.

It’s called “the defender put themselves in a bad/aggressive defensive position and the offensive player took advantage.” For example, the Embiid rip through. If you are going to extend your hands into the offensive player’s space, and they then move a body part within their space to where it makes contact, the refs are rightfully going to call a reach in foul. Another one I see people complain about is when Trae Young drives and then stops on a dime to get the trailing defender to run into him. The defender is in the wrong 100% of the time. Young is in his own space, if he stops, the defender also has to stop before he makes contact. If players don’t want to get called for a foul, they have to play less aggressive defense. However, that has its own risks. || I'll go long on this someday, but do we really think that if ""you don't get cheap fouls, but you can grab people and elbow them in the chest really hard and you won't get called for it"" that Joel Embiid, who is 7'1 and weighs 280, is all of a sudden going to be completely helpless? Sure, he gets injured a lot, but that's from all that weight moving very fast on ligaments that aren't built to do that, not an elbow going into his chest. For 98% of NBA players, I'm betting ""you can elbow him, but he gets to elbow you back"" ends badly for the other guy when Joel Embiid is involved. 

At the end of the day, I feel like Joel Embiid would be able to learn how to elbow people and get elbowed a lot faster than Bill Wennington would be able to learn how to hit threes and hit a crossover into a fadeaway from the high post, ya know? || Embiid is a big man and has a PPG dropoff so bad in the playoffs that it actually [broke records](https://fadeawayworld.net/joel-embiid-had-the-largest-ppg-drop-in-the-playoffs-for-an-mvp-in-nba-history) for an MVP calibre player. A good amount of that dropoff is from his foulbaiting habits in the regular season.

If you don’t foul them, you don’t send them to the line, but that requires playing straight up defense. Players like Luka, Embiid, Trae Young, and SGA are good enough to where you can’t do that. None of these guys are talentless bums who can only shoot free throws. If they aren’t drawing fouls from overly exuberant defending, they’ll find another way to score. They just take advantage of the fact that they can’t be played straight up, and that’s just smart basketball. || Adam Silver has allowed foreigners to turn the NBA to a soap opera, please || Agreed. Totally.  And I love that they got rid of the leg kick and such. But overall my problem is the refs have too much to do with the game. It’s too front and center.

So yeah, I'm calling nonsense on the idea that foul baiting isn't real. It's just another way to flop without hitting the floor.

As far as the rip move: The defender is not initiating the contact on the rip through move, though. And replays often show the offensive player making the move to initiate contact, not to make a basketball play. And some videos will show Embiid actually locking the opponent's arm so they can't get away thus drawing the foul. As for Trae letting a defender run into him: is he trying to make a basketball play, or get the refs to call the whistle? The way you word it you even admit he does it to get the defender to run into him. || Gilbert Arenas brain rot effects are very visible on you. Rodman was one of the biggest floppers I've ever seen. He flopped just as much as Divac but you probably view him as a tough American and symbol of physical 90s-early 00s game. Get a reality check. || That’s just the nature of basketball. It’s a fast moving, physical game that paradoxically does not allow contact, so the rules have to draw the line somewhere and the refs are given the extremely difficult task of deciding what is and isn’t a foul.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.018,0.879,0.104,0.9925,0.088,0.761,0.151,0.999

My stats were taken from StatMuse, NBA.com and Basketball Reference.

I took some of the best scorers of our time, clearly the most prolific ones such as MJ, Kobe Harden ( a well known free throw marchant), Doncic and LeBron averaged just the same free throw attempts as SGA yet they're not called free-throw marchants although when watching games James and Doncic tend to flop.

 Considering that most of SGA scoring attempts are either the ISO or Drive especially with his weird playing style a lot of defenders tend to lean their bodies more into SGA and he also initiates a lot of contact in order to get some space in his shot creation but it seems a lot of his critics do not actually watch his games and also don't bring up actual stats like I have. This is r/NBA discussion so I'm down to have people refute my stats and facts by having a debate like thoughtful individuals. Peace to you all.













",0,31,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i4pb4u/sga_freethrow_marchant_discourse/,2025-01-18 22:40:05,"Watching SGA I couldn't help seeing how he rams into defenders often and then flinch when the defenders stood ground. His midrange jumpers (and now 3s) are so consistent, defenders cannot give space and he uses that to his advantage. But I think SGA also plays up to his somewhat lean frame in creating contact and selling fouls more than tanks like LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard || SGA critics will always make it about how he gets his FTA's, not how many he gets. Much easier to do mental gymnastics that way. If you cite averages, they'll say he foul baits more against good teams. If you say he dropped 40 with 5 FTA against the Cavs, they'll ignore you and link a clip of him exaggerating contact that you could find if you search for any great player's name + ""flop"". || [removed] || [removed] || Anyone who calls anyone a free-throw merchant is just not a serious fan of basketball. Drawing fouls is an intelligent thing to do, and it’s as valuable a skill as there is. You put your opponent on the back foot, make it so that they have to play worse defense to stay out of foul trouble, and you get easy shots. || Someone like Shai who’s learned to play the Canadian brand of basketball was never taught to have the same kind of dawg that Americans have. Hence why the top floppers/free throw merchants are all foreign born players. || He does lean head first into defenders a lot then snaps his head back. I don’t like to watch it because it’s so obvious but you can’t even blame sga for doing it if the officials keep rewarding it. || Exactly, at this point there's no reason to respond to them. He dropped 37points out of 54 points last night yet they bring up the free throws all the time. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || Please keep your comments civil. This is a subreddit for thoughtful discussion and debate, not aggressive and argumentative content. || Yeah, don’t hate the player hate the game. 

If they want to change the foul system, then change it. The reduction of shooting fouls has been better. || Foul baiting is putting the game in the hands of the referee, not playing basketball. I would love to see a sharp increase in offensive fouls called when an offensive player blatantly baits the defender. This is like in the NFL if an offensive lineman was able to do a false start at will but the defender gets called for offsides the moment they take the bait. Yes, there is a fine line between this and the early 2000's 95 point slugfests. Neither are good. But we shouldn't advocate for one because we are so afraid of the other. || But in this very sub Embiid gets hate for baiting fouls || [removed] || Dude played in the States too lol. How can you talk about the Canadian hoop scene without having watched it? It's funny you say that because another international player will be MVP and this has been ongoing for the past 6 years now and Canadian and European players have caught up to Americans because of basic understanding of the fundamentals of Basketball which Americans lack but eh in your minds you think you're greater than the world || Then you always hear the audible ""OHHH!"" when he feels any sort of contact.

Not hating on the guy, lots of other players do it.  But now I can't *not* hear it. || He certainly exaggerates contact, just like every good NBA scorer. People have just fixated on clips of the egregious head snaps he's done in the past because it looks especially dumb, and confirmation bias does rest. I'm a biased homer, so I find the FT merchant accusations hilarious because I'd say the more legit critique of SGA is offensive fouling with his arm clears and shoulder bumps. Even then, it's debatable, and not anything that MJ or Kobe didn't use to the same degree. Only thing he can do at this point is win a title tbh. Without the hardware, it's a lot easier to disregard how legit his game is. || I’m not against a slight change in the rules to allow more physicality, but it’s a real fine line. The last time they allowed more physicality (ie hand checking) it helped deflate overall scoring, which absolutely is more boring than watching a dozen or so extra free throws per game. || Foul baiting isn’t real. It’s called “the defender put themselves in a bad/aggressive defensive position and the offensive player took advantage.” For example, the Embiid rip through. If you are going to extend your hands into the offensive player’s space, and they then move a body part within their space to where it makes contact, the refs are rightfully going to call a reach in foul. Another one I see people complain about is when Trae Young drives and then stops on a dime to get the trailing defender to run into him. The defender is in the wrong 100% of the time. Young is in his own space, if he stops, the defender also has to stop before he makes contact. If players don’t want to get called for a foul, they have to play less aggressive defense. However, that has its own risks. || I'll go long on this someday, but do we really think that if ""you don't get cheap fouls, but you can grab people and elbow them in the chest really hard and you won't get called for it"" that Joel Embiid, who is 7'1 and weighs 280, is all of a sudden going to be completely helpless? Sure, he gets injured a lot, but that's from all that weight moving very fast on ligaments that aren't built to do that, not an elbow going into his chest. For 98% of NBA players, I'm betting ""you can elbow him, but he gets to elbow you back"" ends badly for the other guy when Joel Embiid is involved. 

At the end of the day, I feel like Joel Embiid would be able to learn how to elbow people and get elbowed a lot faster than Bill Wennington would be able to learn how to hit threes and hit a crossover into a fadeaway from the high post, ya know? || Embiid is a big man and has a PPG dropoff so bad in the playoffs that it actually [broke records](https://fadeawayworld.net/joel-embiid-had-the-largest-ppg-drop-in-the-playoffs-for-an-mvp-in-nba-history) for an MVP calibre player. A good amount of that dropoff is from his foulbaiting habits in the regular season. 

Shai is a smaller player and yet doesn’t seem as reliant on baiting fouls to generate points. || And that’s also ridiculous. Again, I personally will never give a player crap for trying to get to the line. I did it when I played because it was the right move to make from a basic strategic level. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || It’s not a cheap way of playing the game. It’s an intelligent way to play the game. If you don’t foul them, you don’t send them to the line, but that requires playing straight up defense. Players like Luka, Embiid, Trae Young, and SGA are good enough to where you can’t do that. None of these guys are talentless bums who can only shoot free throws. If they aren’t drawing fouls from overly exuberant defending, they’ll find another way to score. They just take advantage of the fact that they can’t be played straight up, and that’s just smart basketball. || Adam Silver has allowed foreigners to turn the NBA to a soap opera, please || Agreed. Totally.  And I love that they got rid of the leg kick and such. But overall my problem is the refs have too much to do with the game. It’s too front and center. But it is what it is unless they change it. || If foul baiting isn't real, then why do we have some of these quotes? To be clear, some are sour grapes, but still...

>""The way we're teaching the officials, we're just enabling players to BS their way to the foul line.""

>""We have enabled the players, and they are taking full advantage. It's a parade to the free-throw line, and it's disgusting to watch.""

\-Steve Kerr. It was after a loss, but still...another quote from him, after a loss as well, where he even mentions this in regard to his own star player:

>""I love what I'm seeing. I think the officials are doing a great job. The game has more of an authentic feel. You are seeing some players draw fouls that maybe they would have gotten the last few years, and they are not being rewarded for that.""

>""I think there's a purity to it that I'm seeing. We even saw Steph, a couple of times pump fake, start to jump into his guy and then realize, ""Oh I'm not going to get that,"" and he moves the ball on.""



>“Last year, there was an adjustment,” Silver began. “Part of it was a response to the basketball community that they felt we were allowing players to hunt for fouls, particularly in certain offensive plays were not traditional basketball plays.

\-Adam Silver. He does say it is in response to the basketball community. But that doesn't just include fans. 

>The non-basketball move highlighted in this segment shows a shooter launching or leaning into a defender at an abnormal angle.

So yeah, I'm calling nonsense on the idea that foul baiting isn't real. It's just another way to flop without hitting the floor.

As far as the rip move: The defender is not initiating the contact on the rip through move, though. And replays often show the offensive player making the move to initiate contact, not to make a basketball play. And some videos will show Embiid actually locking the opponent's arm so they can't get away thus drawing the foul. As for Trae letting a defender run into him: is he trying to make a basketball play, or get the refs to call the whistle? The way you word it you even admit he does it to get the defender to run into him. || Gilbert Arenas brain rot effects are very visible on you. Rodman was one of the biggest floppers I've ever seen. He flopped just as much as Divac but you probably view him as a tough American and symbol of physical 90s-early 00s game. Get a reality check. || That’s just the nature of basketball. It’s a fast moving, physical game that paradoxically does not allow contact, so the rules have to draw the line somewhere and the refs are given the extremely difficult task of deciding what is and isn’t a foul.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.018,0.879,0.104,0.9925,0.088,0.761,0.151,0.999
Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-01-20,nbadiscussion,1i6jo8a,Minnesota Game Notes From MLK Weekend,"This team ""could"" be built to play their best basketball in April, May, and June.

I received a lot of positive feedback about posting my notes from the games I watched in preparation for my guest-hosting gig on the All-NBA podcast with Tim Legler. [Here are the notes from those games.](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/the-tim-legler-podcast-that-never)

I’m sharing notes from three games again but keeping one team the same: Minnesota.

Thanks for reading Low Man Help! 

* MIN vs. NYK
* MIN vs. CLE
* MIN vs. MEM

That’s three games in four nights, which is a good snapshot of the team. All three opponents are high-quality and present unique challenges.

MIN went 1-2 in these games. They are working through a new roster and could be a dangerous team in April. But, if they don't get it together, they could become wasted potential.

**Three macro things stood out to me on this three-game set:**

1. Rob Dillingham’s development.
2. Julius Randle’s playmaking opportunity.
3. Anthony Edward’s PnR reads—Process vs. Result mindset.

I was drawn to Dillingham during these three games, especially in the PnR. He’s a key piece in the MIN puzzle. They don’t have a lot of bites at the PD apple, and he’s a top-10 pick that they gave up a lot to get. His development matters a lot to their calculus.

**Dillingham’s PnR before the three-game stretch:**

* Per 100: 43 - He’s getting the film.
* PPD: 0.921 - He’s getting in the right spots; the process reads can improve.

**Dillingham’s PnR after the three-game stretch:**

* Per 100: 43.6
* PPD: 1.047 - He showed that his speed and creativity can present a unique element in this action.

Another big-picture takeaway was how vital Randle’s playmaking is for this team. JR and MIN should increasingly embrace it to be the best team they can be. I don’t know if he enjoys it more than scoring, but I believe it’s his elite skill and the one that MIN needs him to do the most.

Randle has the size and skill to create [cracked shells and rotations](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/the-blueprint-cracking-the-shell?r=2wmouo) against almost any defender he faces. Cover him with a guard, and he can bully in the post till you send a double. Cover him with a big, and he can get into the paint via dribble to draw a second defender. Put him in a two-man action with Edwards, and he gets to play advantage basketball from the pocket.

**Randle’s Playmaking Stats:**

4.5 Assist (Need more here as the season ticks on)

3.0 TOs

The optionality and playmaking of Randle & Dillingham are two of the most significant swing factors for this team.

Finally, the Rudy-Edwards dynamic is weird. Edwards does not like to give Rudy the ball in the pocket every time in blitzed two-man actions. I think Rudy needs as many reps as he can get in pocket playmaking situations, but even that feels weird to say out loud, given that Rudy is in his 12th year in the league.

\^\^ Edwards openly gets frustrated with Rudy during games. I am not sure that’s great for the situation—something to monitor.

# MIN/NYK:

MIN—Off the bat, OReb kicked out three. There is NO better time to shoot the ball. I think it’s because we grow up catching passes from a rebounder under the basket, so it’s the most natural motion. Who knows.

MIN—Randle + Edwards DHO game could be a game changer when teams go to blitz AE.

MIN only runs 3.9 per 100 and scores 1.095, but this action would be gold for them with Randle and Reid's ball-handling ability. It would also allow AE to set up backdoor cuts and play 3v2 downhill—scary.

Handoff Combo (pre-MEM game)

**Randle + Edwards:**

* Per 100: 3.9
* PPD: 1.095

**Reid + Edwards:**

* Per 100: 2.6
* PPD: 1.292

MIN—Not many players in the NBA are better at reading Drop coverage than Conley. The floater is such a weapon when “breaking” the big in the drop. Here’s a breakdown of MC “breaking” PnR bigs from last year's DEN series.

NYK—Brunson’s floater is up there with MC and he’s pretty good at “Breaking” bigs in the PnR. He’s such a fun watch. What a start for JB here, where would NYK be without him?

NYK—Bridges driving closeouts looks good, back to back catch & shoot threes generated. NYK needs more shot creation for from guys not named JB.

* OG misses corner drift WIMS read on first drive, turns into a ATB three instead of corner one.
* JB makes an awesome 2nd window WIMS reads for a catch & shoot three.

MIN—Good creativity and read from Dillingham in first PnR with Reid - got to use the left hand on the left side. Guys are too athletic in this league, can’t give that angle back.

MIN—AE step back 3… If Rudy is under the rim, has a cross-match, and you can see both of his numbers, you must give him a touch. Got to have some EQ there.

MIN—Dillingham’s speed is an outlier. Opened up a Reid 3 PM in a PnR action and then a lob to Rudy on an empty corner PnR. He looks like he’s got a chance to be a guy that can blow a game open every few nights.

MIN—The other side of the floor is a more significant learning curve for Dillingham. Back to back threes from Payne during his PnR coverage. I know it’s a drop with Rudy, but I would love to see how he evolves with getting skinny or not dying as much on the screen.

\^ Just gambled for a steal on a switch and gave up another Payne 3. No bueno.

NYK—CAM PAYNE is making it RAIN!! He just broke off a play to get a SB3 up, lol. I can’t fault him for wanting the heat check there, but Hart didn’t like it.

MIN—Dillingham gets a TO on a lob to Rudy by not making Sims “break” his 2v1 coverage in the drop. I’m excited to see where RD is at by the end of the year in reading 2v1 actions in PnR Drop coverage.

Three Dillingham PnRs from 1st half: Missed lefty opp and one good “breaking” read + one poor “breaking” read — I’m willing to bet he figures the NBA PnR out with reps.

NYK—Bridges & Hart’s defenders sitting slightly deeper in the gaps—court compressed. Without JB on the court, it’s difficult for them to generate good stuff consistently. Maybe it’s just this stretch.

**Bridges & Hart without JB According to CLG:**

* \+15.2 with Towns (507 poss)
* \+16.5 without towns (102 poss)

MIN—Reid feels like a cheat code. Man, that guy is talented offensively.

\^ How long will he be amenable to coming off the bench?

NYK—They refuse to switch JB onto a good guard in PnR actions. AE just burned them two plays in a row for 5 points. AE gets the switch right before the half and goes drag → SB3 on JB.

NYK—Bridges keeps shooting. I respect the hell out of that guy. The worst thing is going 0-1 while turning down nine open looks. I love that he’s willing to go 0-10.

MIN—There are just a few missed single reads from AE every game that feel forced. He’s so talented that he thinks he can score in any situation (he might be able to). But there are times when hitting a single would do wonders for him/MIN; this is one of them. Open corner 3 or swing swing to MC 3 if JB makes the help the helper closeout.

NYK—1st poss of the 2nd half JB off-ball screen action. NYK has to find ways (like this) to get him time off the ball to attack from an advantage. It's too much of a load to handle and score as much as they need him to—similar to Cade in DET without Ivey.

MIN—AE -> Rudy in the pocket | Rudy -> McDaniels in the corner | McDaniels advantage attack to a middy. You have to get Rudy these reps in the pocket now; they'll need to be able to play this card in May.

MIN—AE and JR have with two TOs on backside defenders stealing passes in the span of five possessions. Too casual.

NYK—What will they do when they get to the PO, and all teams do is spam JB’s man as the screener in every PnR action? It looks exhausting trying to keep him from switching.

AE had his way in these actions throughout the game. NYK gave up a Beasley 3 to lose vs. DET on a PnR where they didn’t want to switch JB onto Cade.

NYK—Must play fast without JB on the floor. Hart is easily a top 5 transition player in the NBA. He's so creative in the open court.

MIN—AE “breaking” Sims for a PnR lob to Rudy, I love that! AE can be the best player in the world if he falls in love with the process of hitting singles. The talent is otherworldly; he would grind teams down.

# MIN/CLE:

MIN—First play… geez. AE gives up layup to DM going UNDER a DHO. If you go under the action, you can NOT give up a straight-line drive at the rim. Bad tone setter here from AE.

MIN—Help UP the lane dunk for Rudy on an MC advantage drive. I imagine this is what they looked like when MC got traded to MIN.

CLE—Garland is so good at reading whether Rudy is “breaking” in the 2v1 Drop. I could watch him play PnR basketball all day. He’s the best teaching tape out there for young guards. I would 100% use it for Rob Dillingham. They are both undersized and have to be crisp and creative with the reads.

MIN—JR’s shooting is a significant swing factor for this team. It feels like he is turning down a lot of looks that Towns feasted off in two-man games with AE and MC. He’s had one outlier season as a shooter; otherwise, it’s low 30s.

\^\^ My eyes say the shot is not linked together and I would not bet on him shooting 40% on volume again with these current form.

MIN—Great LMH AE read and swing swing 3. This is the NYK play before halftime from last night. This is one of those singles that have to be hit every time and live with the results because it’s great process.

AE has made three of these early LMH reads → Corner passes this game. It’s nice to see him do the simple. Each one has resulted in a GREAT shot for MIN.

CLE—There is such a big difference in the quality of three-point looks they’re getting up tonight compared to the OKC game. Their dribble penetration looks so much better. OKC is so good at keeping the ball out of the paint.

MIN—FINALLY they get the ball to the middle of the zone (Reid) after five empty trips, and no one gets into the soft spot. The zone is giving MIN fits a good change-up pitch from KA.

MIN—How talented is Reid?! Off the bounce 3, soft spot of the zone euro floater, and running two-man game into a help up the lane lob to Rudy. All in the span of a few minutes.

MIN—NAW, great story of self-awareness. There was a real chance he was going to end up out of the league after NOP. His shift from “I can be the man” to “How can I amplify the man” will make him generational wealth. So awesome to see.

MIN—AE DHO with JR into an early LMH read and wide open Reid 3…. I love the process here. More singles like this from AE is a big deal, make or miss.

MIN—McDaniels & Randle do not give me much confidence as a shooter. Their kinetic linking isn’t good. It opens the door for mental blocks when they hit a stretch of the misses.

MIN—Rudy in the pocket → Help UP the lane → McDaniels in the dunker. Keep getting Rudy the reps!!

CLE—Graland and Mitchell are cooking this Drop coverage. What a two-headed monster those guys are in the backcourt. Play too deep, three ball. Get up to the level; pocket pass to 3v2. Help too much with LMH, skip pass for 3. These dudes are lights out against Drop.

**Garland & Mitchell vs. MIN:**

* 40 Direct PnR
* 60 Points

\^\^ Rudy’s DROP Coverage in PO—I feel like MIN matches up well with OKC and poorly with DAL because of this specific coverage. Luka can shred this coverage shooting from deep. SGA can cook it, too, but he won’t break you from the three-point line like Luka can.

MIN—I love it when Randle does the dirty work; he is all over the O glass. He’s so strong and can create chaos when physically engaged at a high level.

MIN—I do not understand how MIN forgets to get the ball to the soft spot in the center of the zone. Every time they get a touch there, it turns into good looks, but they forget and let CLE off the hook by passing around the perimeter multiple times in a row.

**MIN vs. CLE Zone:**

* 20 Poss
* 16.6 Avg. Poss Length
* 0.700 PPP

MIN—Dillingham PnRs in 4th. At his size, he’s got to be so crisp in the process and relentless in attacking.

* Allen in a switch and gives it up, no bueno. Keep it or boomerang here; get some penetration. SGA was merciless on these switches a few nights ago.
* Jerome UNDER on the next one and keeps going (he shot this one vs NYK).

CLE—Hunting Dillingham with Garland or Mitchell to salt this game away. These are good reps for RD but he’s got to figure out how he can put more resistance on guys at his size.

# MIN/MEM:

MIN—First play… geez. AE dies on a screen and gives up a WIDE OPEN Bane three. gap it or lock and get on the back hip and L&T. I know it's much easier to say, but back-to-back games with bad tone-setters from AE.

MIN—Randle Handoff game opening up things for AE. I really like where this action could go; so much optionality, and if blitzed, then Randle 4v3 is the best option for MIN.

MEM—Morant, man that dude is special finishing around the rim. Lefty one-hand pickup, wow!

MIN—Another backside TO to JR, this time from MC. All of them are in the 20ft area. I wonder if it’s a spacing thing with the bodies covering up where help defenders are located. Out at the 3-point line, you would see the backside defender; in the post, they wouldn’t be low enough.

MEM—It's not Morant-only, but the rip-through foul grifting is out of control again. Ty Jerome, Brunson, Morant, and Edwards. I’ve seen so much rip-through grifting over the past three games.

MIN—JR is creating a lot of good offensive looks as a playmaker. He can generate quality actions when he’s in the open-court playmaking.

MIN—AE PnR Single Reads. 2nd Half THREAD.

He’s one of the best players on earth. I really think he can be the best player in any series if he leans into hitting singles and trusting teammates more. He does it sometimes, and I believe consistently doing it would begin to empower his teammates and elevate them/him. Teammates feel when the best player trusts/believes in them (Jokic does this), and it helps; god, does it help them become more.

**Process vs. Results:** Too many times it feels like AE is swayed by the results of the previous play. AE has another leap in his game (scary) and it will come when he is no longer controlled by the results and falls in love with the process.

* PnR 1 (Level → Blitz/Switch) Opportunity to get JR in a 2v1 playmaking opportunity. AE takes a forced shot off a spin move.
* PnR 2: (Level → Blitz) Finds Rudy in the pocket early enough that Rudy can get his head around and read LMH. MIN gets WIDE OPEN 3 from Advantage Basketball created by AE.
* PnR 3: (Level → Blitz) Finds Rudy in the pocket again; the screen is lower, and space is tighter for Rudy. Rudy reads LMH and sees help UP the lane but makes too hot of a pass to handle for NAW.
* PnR 4: (Level → Blitz) Doesn’t hit Rudy in Pocket. He gets the corner on JJJ and forces the action. AE gets a foul, but it’s a bad process, and it’s a 50/50 foul. These are the plays where the previous result (not process) shapes AE’s process.
* PnR 5: (Level → Blitz/Switch) Gets the corner on SA and creates a cracked shell. AE can make this type of difficult finish, but there is a wide-open catch & shoot 3 from a really good shooter whose man has switched onto him. I believe he sees Wells here, so he knows it’s not a Veer switch.
* PnR 6: (Level → Blitz) Finds JR in the pocket early, and it leads to an open catch & shoot 3 for a really good shooter. Love the process here and trusting teammates at the end of a game. JR can thrive as a 4v3 playmaker in this type of two-man setting with AE when teams blitz.

PnR 4 & 5 are the ones where his results drive the process. I think his game makes the leap when he falls in love with the process and empowering his teammates.

*Side note—No AE bounce passes to Rudy. It is much harder for bigs to catch a non-bounce pass and then make good pocket decisions. MC gets Rudy bounce passes in the pocket more frequently, which helps his playmaking.*

MIN—AE off-ball actions in this game seem to be greater than the previous two; I really like that. Makes the on-ball action scary at the end of the game because you don’t have as much of a rhythm seeing it.

MIN—Dillingham PnR reads keep getting better. I really think the reps are helping so much and you can feel his teammates empowering him to take them. Feels like his teammates understand how much chaos his speed can cause.

* Pull up 3 vs. Drop—Love it! At his size, he’s got to be a process monster and be able to hit every shot in the book in the PnR. I think he has the talent to do it, the shot needs to be linked together a bit more to be a consistent shooter from above the break.
* Back to back plays where the nail help just stunts at RD. The first time he gives it up, and the second time, he keeps and gets a layup. Really like to see him learning on the fly.

\^\^ Big RD stretch in the 4th.

MEM—Morant is special going downhill. The fact that you can still go UNDER on any PnR actions with him and live with the results makes me feel like he can’t take the step of consistently being the best player in a series during the PO.

MIN—AE and NR gave up 4 points in the second half saving the ball underneath their basket. Little things like that kill you in close games.

MIN—JR is the guy who has to play make in the pocket when AE gets blitzed at the end of games. Created two WIDE open threes.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || Great read, thanks!

Love seeing NAW get a shoutout. He’s come so far last 3-4 years. Keeps adding to his game. I thought this particular 3 game stretch was one of his weaker ones of the year, which isn’t a knock, he’s been incredibly consistent. Can’t wait to see if he translates in the playoffs this year, last year was too big of a stage but his confidence & bag keeps growing.

Thoughts on starting Naz over Julius?  Naz allows Rudy to be much more of a rover (Rudy is just average as a man defender IMO). Randle has had a nice season and is great when things are going well and he looks pass first but when he ducks his head its game over for the offense, see both memphis games for examples of top of my head.  Feel like Naz’s instant decision making leads to better offense vs Julius’s slow slow slow ball stopping.  Though Julius can be nice when hes passing (ie Cavs game).

Really really excited for Dillingam’s growth. He needs time to mature but the stage isnt too big for him.  They might have a pretty good offensive player here. || The Wolves are okay, they'll probably perform better in the playoffs just because Ant is a demon there and for whatever reason he just makes like 45% of his midrange shots. But they still arent a good team or particularly well constructed.

Dillingham is insane. || Great job.  Going to cross post this in in r/timberwolves.

Minnesota prefers dribble drive paint touches vs. passing to person in the paint.  So their main actions don't typically apply well to get to the soft spot of the zone.It is a point of frustration with me as well. || A lot to unpack here. First off, you're welcome. Thanks for reading it.

NAW, I love it when players figure out who they are in the league and how they can fit in. Every one of these guys has always been the best player on any team they’ve played on before making it to the NBA; having the self-awareness to know and accept that this has changed is a hard step for a player to grasp. So my hat goes off to him for that.

NAW in the PO. I hope it goes well for him (a big bag is coming if so). It will be all about simplification of his game. Take open threes, drive closeouts if run off the line, and make good decisions on early help = pass or not enough help = finish. Basketball is simple, but that doesn't mean it's easy to do at this speed.

Reid vs. Randle. I don't know. I love NR, but JR has the playmaking that this team desperately needs in a PnR partnership with AE to be a high-level team. They both will play a lot in a PO setting, so not so much of a big deal here, but they do have to figure out if NR is the long-term starter. 

Dillingham is a big swing piece. He's talented, that's for sure. I bet TC sees some miniature Will Barton in him. I think getting him the reps now in the PnR is critical (it feels like they are) because his speed can create chaos and make life easier for many other guys. Especially AE when it comes to always having to generate defensive rotation.

  
I hope that covers it all. Thanks for reading, and looking forward to seeing how this team develops in the 2nd half of the season. || Better in the playoffs, yes, AE has shown to be great in that type of setting.

I know it doesn’t look pleasant now, but I think they have a chance to be special in the PO. Some tweaks have to be made, but I think there is a great team inside of the parts they have. || Thanks! I posted it in their sub (I'm not usually in there, so it might get taken down).

The zone stuff is very elementary. That should never happen with an NBA consistently in one single game. || Whats been so jarring is that there is rarely ever a game in which Minny has played greater than the sum of their parts, they havent clicked as a unit at all. || I haven't watched every game, but this might be true, which can be a positive if you're inclined to look at their glass as half-full. 

They have higher gears to get to as a team over the second half of the year. Just got to find them. || There's been multiple little 3 game sections of the season where they've clicked and gone on a 3 game win streak with each win being by 20pts. 

They'll usually come out the gate in game 4 surrendering a 14-2 run in the opening minutes and just lose their mojo for the next 10 games or so. Usually go like 4-6 in those stretches with a few single possession loses.

It's a really weird season for them. They have the talent to make a deep playoff run but the sustained chemistry has just not been there. They'll either get really hot late and upset the 3 seed or fizzle out.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.088,0.771,0.142,0.9997,0.061,0.716,0.223,0.9995
Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-01-29,nbadiscussion,1idhv29,Claiming a player getting a favorable whistle based on his FTA and FTA-related stat alone is wildly inaccurate or even meaningless.,"Let's say there is a fictional player who has mastered every single way of foul-baiting before entering the NBA. He is a close friend to every single referee, all the NBA league staff, and the Commissioner.

Let us call him Frank Travis Anthony. And he enters the NBA now.

Frank flops, head-snaps, and Ayeeeeeeee his way to 25 FTA per game in the first season.

But he only gets 10 FTA per game in the following sophomore season.

Can we claim he gets a less favorable whistle in his second season?

I dont think so. The defenders, acknowledging the Master-baiter Frank's genius, will give him more space and avoid contact to stay on the court (like the hands-on-the-back defense style against 2018 Harden). The FTA surely is going down. But the fact that he is getting a good whistle remains unchanged. It just impacts the game in another form.

Yes, this is an extreme case. And the post is inspired by recent SGA's ""I don**'**t need free throw"" comment.

**And I am NOT here to discuss if SGA or whoever is getting a more favorable whistle than others.**

I am just a bit tired of all these discussions revolving around the FTA or FTA per drive or FTA per Ayeeeeee. These kinds of stats are just scratching the surface. 

We need to use statistics indicating the relationship between contact initiation, contact levels, and call results, which do not exist(just watch the inconsistency of the calls or even calls' reviews from the officials). Then, the next best thing is your eye test. Unfortunately, eye tests can not be quantified in an online or even real-life discussion and are too subjective to persuade anyone (which is unlikely, anyway). ",0,15,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1idhv29/claiming_a_player_getting_a_favorable_whistle/,2025-01-30 02:42:22,"Calls should have a threshold factor (a test) that can be crossed and if the offensive player crosses that threshold the player gets no benefit of the call. As is the case with flagrant fouls needing a windup and follow thru there needs to be a test for those player that are constantly seeking contact with non basketball moves solely for the purpose of a foul call. 

Trae's constant purposeful dribbling to get in front of a defender, then veering into the player's path while throwing on the brakes to cause a purposeful collision and repeating that over and over is a good example of where there needs to be a test that will discourage that play. IMO || People just fundamentally don’t understand how free throws work and it’s an easy thing to complain about when looking at a box score or watching a game, so they use terms like “ethical basketball” and “flopper” to glamorize not going to the free throw line and demonize guys who are good at it, even though being good at it is actually super helpful to your team. You potentially get points and get the other team in foul trouble, that’s a double win. 

At some level I get it because people don’t watch basketball for free throws, but getting to the line is a legitimate skill || Also, lots of players get fouled a lot because they're just hard to guard legitimately. Shaq took a lot of free throws not because he was a foul merchant, but because he was almost impossible to stop WITHOUT fouling him. Same with early career LeBron, same with Giannis. Among smaller players, that's also true of players like MJ and Kobe, they're so fast and slippery that defenders get caught out of position and the options are fouling or getting blown by. It's the latter category I think SGA falls into, as well as having a strong stop-start and fake skills that make defenders crash into fouls. || Play style is a huge factor in these numbers.  Absolutely.  More than anything, IMO.  Even if we acknowledge that NBA officials tend to not officiate every player exactly the same way.   And that goes both ways.  The way Lebron plays is a really interesting thing to observe on offense as he’s aged.  He used to look for contact more than he does no and it’s had some influence on his FTAs.  He also has become more of a jump shooter, and the impact there is obvious.   

And when I say avoid contact I mean that in the post he’s tended to try to be sneakier.  Plays a little like Siakam in some ways.  He will still bully people, but he picks his spots more. || its also really funny that people complain about how many free throws are being shot in the nba these days. despite the fact that free throw rates have been the lowest in nba history over the past few years || I get what your saying, but think about what you’re saying. “Getting to the line is a legitimate skill” is true, but is one the level of “flopping in soccer is a legitimate skill”. Rolling around for 2 minutes matters cause they only ever add so much stoppage time (partially for TV). Agreed that it’s beneficial, but it’s still a bitch ass move. Now whether it should be on the player or the league to change it is up to you (obviously the league, like what are we doing here NBA), but saying someone shouldn’t complain about a bitch ass move because it’s beneficial is dumb in my opinion. || Most people only watch highlight reels and look at the box score. 

A smaller guy who goes hard to the rim (SGA/Ant/Ja etc) is going to get the whistle and that's a good thing. That action is great for the fans. When Harden/Trey drive, their goal is to find the right moment to stop 8-15ft from the rim and draw a foul. That is unwatchable. 

Wemby exhagerating his fall is a bit annoying, but that is happening because he really doesn't get the whistle he deserves right now. Joker does similar things and is usually rewarded right away. I don't think either of them are flopping. Now Embiid crying after being grazed by the defenders jersey when he's already been to the line 16 times is annoying AF.

I love LBJ, but this is the first season where we are seeing a major decline. Obviously his style has shifted, but yeah. He barely goes for contact on the block or at the rim anymore. He's still getting a lot of credit from the refs on the other end. His non-existent effort on defense has made him reach in more and make some lazy hacks at guys driving at the rim. But he hasn't been getting whistled for it. Then again, he deserves it. The whistles MJ got on Washington were insane. || I’d make the distinction basically that getting pissed because a guy is flopping is fair, getting upset simply because a guy gets to the line isn’t, and that happens plenty || But what I’m saying is taking advantage of the rules (intentionally moving in a way you wouldn’t in order to make contact) is bad for the game. It does take skill, but it is also a bitch ass move. I use the soccer comparison because everyone can see that, but anytime taking advantage of the rules becomes a skill, well the rules probably need to be changed (and the player taking advantage of them is a bitch ass). || I guess we disagree here, if you can move in a way that forces a foul and you’re not snapping your head back, falling over, yelling, etc then I’d see that as a skill and it’s more on the defense for not being able to stop it and the rules for allowing it than on the offensive player

For example, if I’m in a triple threat position and you put your hand out above my arms in such a way that I can rise up, make contact with your hand and shoot while drawing a foul, that’s on you for being in bad position. Forcing a foul can be a savvy move and often is necessary because it’s what defense dictates || Hm I think there’s nuance here, because I agree with you about that. Cookie jar fouls have to stay just because they point out when the defender is “taking too much”, but I disagree that doing a pump fake, getting the guy to jump, then jumping into him is good for the game. Intentionally stepping out of your drive path just to bump into the defender is bad for the game. Players that seek out these fouls, that have made it their “skill” are making the game worse, but where I would agree with you is that the player has been incentivized to learn these skills. The NBA is most at fault for letting foul hunting be so incentivized.

Edit: the nuance here, in my opinion, is that cookie jar fouls are the offender pointing out that the defender is in a position that foul is meant to eliminate, where as the foul hunting, unnatural movement fouls are the offender creating the foul. || Pump fakes are tricky but I think it’s generally ok outside of the cases where the guys jump sideways to make contact. Most cases I think you can argue are guys trying to take too much on defense, being disciplined on jumping to contest is also a skill. The dribbling part I’m ok with in the open court, but it is almost impossible to cover screens if guys are going to stop and start randomly, so would be great if that was outlawed || Yeah, so I don’t have a problem with “foul hunters” if they are doing the savvy “pointing out the defender in a position they shouldn’t be” thing. My whole problem is many of these player (Embiid and Harden are the worst ones that come to mind) intentionally try to create fouls that aren’t in the spirit of the rules. It’s the NBA’s fault in my opinion for becoming too protective of offensive plays, but I also blame those players for playing a brand of basketball that sucks to watch.",0.204,0.667,0.129,-0.2023,0.038,0.838,0.124,0.9819,0.133,0.74,0.127,-0.9841
Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-01-29,nbadiscussion,1icwt52,Is Tyler Herro playing like an All-Star this year?,"So, the ""hot"" stretch that Tyler Herro had wasn't just a hot stretch. He not only continued to play at a high level, he also has looked better since the season started & with the All-Star reserves coming out tomorrow, I thought it'd be fun to go through his case for it & see where other fanbases also stand here(I'm a Heat fan).

Right now, he's averaging 25/5/6 per 75 possessions on 58% eFG & 62% TS. The only players that matched are Shai, Giannis, Jokic & Curry.

Starting with the impact metrics(EPM by Dunks and Threes; LEBRON by BBall-Index; DPM by Darko; eRAPTOR by Neil Paine), he ranks:  
\- 18th in expected O-EPM with +3.5  
\- 9th in actual O-EPM with +4.2  
\- 17th in O-LEBRON with +2.5  
\- 35th in O-DPM with +2.0  
\- 18th in O-eRAPTOR with +3.5

He ticks off the having good production, elite efficiency(especially given the volume, responsibility, role AND team context), and he also has the advanced metrics in his favour, too.

By all but 1 metric, he's ranked in the top 20 on offense.

Also, do note that I'm focusing on the offensive side. Defensive metrics haven't liked him at all this year(for some, it's the worst in his career). But that matters less to me for things like the All-Star game. This isn't about who's better or who would you rather have on a contending team, where more factors come into play.

What simply matters is what is the job/role for that player in their context & how well are they doing it. What does the team need from that said player & has that player done what they needed them to do?

For Herro, it's an easy yes & he's done it extremely well

He's been their engine offensively. You can see in the tracking/usage stats where he ranks on the team. He's been tasked with a lot of responsibility, both as on/off ball scorer, ball handler, passer & help with spacing/shooting. The offense also revolves around his skillset.

Here's a [link to his tracking & usage stats](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-60ewy0xz2yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1807%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De84c5022f0335573f1aeb2c24a8ab3f18a57a0e9) per BBall-Index compared to everyone on the Heat. Leads the team in touches per 75, ball dominance, offensive involvement rate, on-ball action are, true usage, and scoring possessions per 75. 

Even when looking at just the playtypes(PNR/ISO/Post ups/Handoffs), he ranks first by a good margin:

\- Herro: 10.4  
\- Butler: 6.2  
\- Rozier: 5.1  
\- Bam: 4.9

Herro has been doing it all for the Heat. That's a lot of offense going through him & actions directly involving him to score and yet, he's still putting up highly efficient numbers across the board.

The Heat's offensive rating with him on is 115.5 but take him off & it drops to 107.8 - that's the difference between 10th & 29th. Even in this stretch where the Heat's offense had significantly dropped for the year, he still drags it. In 2025, it's 114.1 with vs 106.8 without.

We also seen his production without Butler. In 20 games without Butler, Herro averages 25pts per 75 poss on 57% eFG & 61% TS with 28% usage. His stats & efficiency don't differ. & those points have been needed a lot. When games are in the mud(they have been a lot lately), you'll take any scoring you can get.

Per Cleaning the Glass, the offense is in the 71st percentile with him on and his on/off is in the 96th(!) percentile. Clear impact on the offensive end.

That's third box ticked for me.

Moving onto the ""eye test""(how he does it) and basketball.

Starting off with his shooting. That has been the biggest difference & it comes down to a change in shot diet & upping the 3pt rate. He's an *elite* shooter. He's 12th in 3pt attempts per 100 at 13.5 & shoots 40.5%. Out of 59 qualifying players with 10 3s, he's 13th in %.

Per BBall-Index shooting metrics, he ranks:

\- 7th in 3pt shooting talent  
\- 7th in 3pt pull up talent  
\- 9th in C&S 3pt talent  
\- 1st in deep 3pt talent

\- 2nd in 3pt shot making  
\- 6th in 3pt pull up shot making  
\- 5th in C&S 3pt shot making  
\- 1st in deep 3pt shot making

It's this change in his shot diet for more 3s that got him the 10th highest TS% increase over a single season since 2014, amongst on-ball guards. This year, it was the second highest behind Garland.

He went from a 45.3% 3pt rate to 55.0%. A 10% increase leaning on a skill that he's been *elite* at for the last few years.

He's the only player to rank top 10 in both 3pt pull up & C&S 3pt talent. Deadly on or off ball. There are also only 8 players to rank top 25 in 3pt shot making, pull up shot making & C&S shot making.

& it's that ability to do so in various ways. He can simply be a spot up shooter, helping with the spacing & making him a dangerous off-ball player. He shoots 48% on wide open 3s + 44% on corners. You CAN'T leave him open. His spacing & gravity helps & makes life easier.

[Here's a link to his C&S 3pt & off-ball video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580807857070146)

That off-ball ability & gravity also turns into this. There are multiple instances where he makes the defense panic if comes off a screen or even looks like he's about to go for a 3pt. That's the level of a shooter that he is. This helps with any off-ball movement run for him

[Here's a link to his gravity video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580809929089386)

But it's the handoff + off the dribble where the scoring has taken a jump - he does take 10 PNRs + handoffs combined. Being able to create space for 3s off dribble or off handoffs adds unpredictability. It makes defense have to over play him & he can still get a 3 off in other ways.

[Here's a link to his off dribble 3s video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580812005204320)

That's why his efficiency looks like this. Per BBall-index, his stable PPP:

\- 1.12 points on handoffs  
\- 1.18 on spot ups  
\- 1.24 in transition  
\- 1.10 on off ball screen  
\- 0.94 in PNR

Only 6 other players score at least 1.0 PPP in the first four & 0.9 in the PNR - Dame/Shai/Haliburton/Powell/Pritchard/Edwards

What this all led to is an improvement inside & everywhere else(including his passing). 1st, he took away his inefficient mid-ranges. He's now also shooting 63% within 4ft & 54% within 4-14ft. Out of 64 players with at least 20 2pt per 100, he's 13th in %

The biggest difference is the driving ability & creating off dribble. There's a DRASTIC difference in how aggressive he looks + how he embraced going through contact. There have also been more counters + better moves to shift & get open then burst to the rim.

That's why there's now a more willingness to attack & get to the rim. His rim rate is at 17%(2nd highest in career) - a big improvement from 11% & 13% the last 2 years. Combine that with the shooting, this has been as best of a 3 level scoring season he's ever had

[Here's a link to his drives video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884583295725216122)

What's also been better is the passing & playmaking. That has taken a significant step from last year & has been as big of a difference maker in his impact as everything stated above. This was another major flaw/weakness & it simply isn't like that anymore

Some stats per BBall-Index amongst 93 on-ball players:

\- 23rd in playmaking talent

\- 24th in passing creation quality

\- 21st in box creation

\- 16th in P&R creation rate

There's been a clear increase in volume + responsibility as a passer & that was a needed thing to learn how to balance that with the scoring.

And when you compare him to himself, that's also where you see the drastic improvement. [Here's a link to his tracking passing stats over the last three years](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-ns8j3sx15yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D735%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De2e6168f4471a0a51d010be42925096be56ea87d)!

[Here's a link to his passing off drives & PNR video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884587337503383633)

This is where you see the improved decision making. He's been reading the defense a lot better. And with him being a more willing driver + more aggressive, these windows open up a lot more.

This also has led to him being way more blitzed and the results were better than expected.

[Here's a link to 6 min of him getting blitzed video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884587341236339164)

Finally, let's also touch on the competition. His comp for the 2 backup guards: Cade/Dame/Garland/Ball/Trae/Haliburton/LaVine

[Here are the metrics for all of them.](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-a53owp3n5yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D812%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D65d771e844f1b86ec3d1264f56ab51ca6c8f07e2)

Herro ranks: 5th, tied 4th, 6th, tied 4th, tied 6th, 5th, and 5th

I'd take Herro over Cade & LaVine. & I'd take Garland over Herro 100%. There's little argument for me for either option.

That leaves Hali/Dame/Ball/Trae. All have strong cases over one another & it just depends on preference + what you value more. For me, he is cut short based on the competition with Garland + either Dame/Hali over him. But that also changes nothing about his season.

HE is an All-Star calibre player. He HAS played like an All-Star. With the improvements that he made & how it all has translated for this season, especially considering the circumstances & the situation, he has taken huge steps & growth.

**So, to answer the question, he has played like an All-Star this year**

The Heat have a better record than the Pistons and Hawks, with Herro also being guarded tightly and being leagues above Cade and Trae in scoring 62.2% TS for Tyler vs 54.7% and 55.8% for Young and Cunningham whilst being a good playmaker himself. 

Herro’s stats are similar to Dame, but I give the edge to Herro based on the fact that his team are only three games behind the Bucks while Dame doesn’t have the attention of a first option the other guys do.

LaMelo I don’t think is worth consideration. || He is but there’s like 8 guards that’s are deserving this year which is irritating because the East frontcourt players have been lacking this season. Someone like Jaylen Brown will get an All-Star spot not because he’s played like one but because there isn’t a deep selection of players he’s competing with unlike Herro. || [removed] || When you look at his numbers and the whole butler situation, it feels like he deserves it because now he’s getting the full attention as a number one too. Yet I doubt he finds a spot with the amazing guard play in the east || Herro is playing really well and I would say he is near all star level.  Dame, Young, will be above him.  With the Drama surrounding Butler the coaches will probably take Maxey, Cade, Haliburton or Ball over him as well.  They might also lump Brown in as a guard.

I would put him at near all star and not all star play.  His points are good 24 PPG but not great 25+ or amazing 30+ and his assists are fairly weak at 5.4. He is having a great season and is significantly improved, but he has not been a top 5-6 guard in the East.  Doesn’t mean he isn’t very good though

Edited PPG from typo || I will have to say I was wrong.  I didn’t think Herro would make the.  Congrats to him || My WIGGA Tyler Herro is one of the best pure scorers we’ve ever seen play basketball. His aura is unmatched. || [removed] || [removed] || I'd have him in my wildcard because the east front court is full of undeserving players imo for the wildcards. Especially with how the hawks will be, idk if Trae will make it even though he does deserve it for how insane his playmaking has been.  Main completion is garland, Cade, dame. 


Hali does not deserve it AT ALL no arguments can be made for him imo, his team is playing better because of their defense bye isn't contributing that much too anyways. Ball is hurt, again, and team sucks so those 2 should get him out. I think dame will get in by being dame (not saying my opinion here) so that just leaves maxey and herro and I think herro is more deserving especially since maxey is inefficient || Hero is okay player. No Heat player should be on the All Star team. Heat is sitting at the 7th spot. .500 teams need to focus on winning not sending players to screw off on All Star weekend.
Heat has done Butler wrong! || The Heat also have had the luxury of having Bam and Jimmy (distraction for most of the season)- which is why they have a better record than the Pistons. And the Pistons have beat them twice already.  || Hey. I don’t think his stats are comparable to Damian Lillard. As a second option, Dame is still drawing noticeably more attention than hero (check gravity measurements) and still putting up noticeably higher points per game and assists numbers. Im not really sure your point about them being down by three games and that correlating to herro being better. I do but it’s a very odd point to make.

I strongly disagree. || cade clears. he’s ahead of him in every single stat while having 0 help on his team. this is the same team that was the worse team i. the league and. one of the worst teams ever. and he turned them into a playoff contender. there team records are almost identical so that’s a non factor. cade also draws way more attention than him since his second option is jaden ivey compared to bam adebayo. i also think dame is slightly better but it’s really close and it’s just an opinion thing || Brown is also a proven commodity || Our sub is for in-depth discussion. Low-effort comments or stating opinions as facts are not permitted. Please support your opinions with well-reasoned arguments, including stats and facts as applicable. || Huh? He's averaging 24ppg not 22 and 5.4 assists is great for a natural off guard that shoots a ton. If u watch the games he's being forced to pass early since double teams come as soon as he crosses the half court line. He's also an elite rebounder for his position 

He may or may not be an allstar but it's crazy to say he hasn't played at an all star lvl || Maxey? Lol 

Herro is averaging 24ppg on 62.2% TS. Trae and averaging 55.8% TS and Cade 54.7% TS. Scoring wise, they’re not in the same league. || How does Butler drama have any kind of impact on Herro or coaches decision of choosing him?

Thanks! || cade dame and garland all deserve those spots over him || Jimmy has missed half the season and even actively sandbagged. He’s added a ton of drama with multiple suspensions, which has led to him being suspended. Clearly not a net positive overall

The Pistons did beat us twice. Interestingly enough in one of the two games Miami lost, Herro went 40/5/8 with 1 turnover on 72% Ts compared to Cade’s 21/7/9 with 7 turnovers on 58% TS - highlighting that even when Herro played better than Cade, thr results may not reflect it. || Jimmy hasnt played this season so calling that a luxury is hilarious, not to mention how putrid Bam has been on offense, teams literally don't guard bam. You should check out some Heat games to get a better look at Herro imo || - Dame 25/5/7 62% TS
- Herro 24/6/5 62% TS

Pretty comparable numbers in my view. Herro is a first option though, so I give him more credit. I wouldn’t say a ppg difference of 1.2ppg is noticeably higher.

I think being a 48 win pace team is quite an underachievement for an All Star playing with a multiple time MVP in their prime, so I don’t give too much credit there. || Bam isn’t a very good offensive player, he’s not much better than Jarrett Allen. Jaden Ivey is a much better 3pt shooter and more reliable shot creator than Bam. || Are we rewarding guys because they’re “proven” or because they deserve it? It’s not like he’s a legend where you can award him with a legacy All-Star nod like Steph, LeBron. And it’s not like he was a top vote getter from the fans. Brown is literally gonna get his nod this year because his competition is weak but he doesn’t deserve it by his play. || You’re right I mistyped points.

5.4 assists is not great.  I am putting him at near all star level which is still great.  It’s not like I am saying he is garbage or stat padding. || Maxey is averaging 27 and 6 assists.

Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-01-30,nbadiscussion,1idhv29,Claiming a player getting a favorable whistle based on his FTA and FTA-related stat alone is wildly inaccurate or even meaningless.,"Let's say there is a fictional player who has mastered every single way of foul-baiting before entering the NBA. He is a close friend to every single referee, all the NBA league staff, and the Commissioner.

Let us call him Frank Travis Anthony. And he enters the NBA now.

Frank flops, head-snaps, and Ayeeeeeeee his way to 25 FTA per game in the first season.

But he only gets 10 FTA per game in the following sophomore season.

Can we claim he gets a less favorable whistle in his second season?

I dont think so. The defenders, acknowledging the Master-baiter Frank's genius, will give him more space and avoid contact to stay on the court (like the hands-on-the-back defense style against 2018 Harden). The FTA surely is going down. But the fact that he is getting a good whistle remains unchanged. It just impacts the game in another form.

Yes, this is an extreme case. And the post is inspired by recent SGA's ""I don**'**t need free throw"" comment.

**And I am NOT here to discuss if SGA or whoever is getting a more favorable whistle than others.**

I am just a bit tired of all these discussions revolving around the FTA or FTA per drive or FTA per Ayeeeeee. These kinds of stats are just scratching the surface. 

We need to use statistics indicating the relationship between contact initiation, contact levels, and call results, which do not exist(just watch the inconsistency of the calls or even calls' reviews from the officials). Then, the next best thing is your eye test. Unfortunately, eye tests can not be quantified in an online or even real-life discussion and are too subjective to persuade anyone (which is unlikely, anyway). ",0,15,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1idhv29/claiming_a_player_getting_a_favorable_whistle/,2025-01-30 02:42:22,"Calls should have a threshold factor (a test) that can be crossed and if the offensive player crosses that threshold the player gets no benefit of the call. As is the case with flagrant fouls needing a windup and follow thru there needs to be a test for those player that are constantly seeking contact with non basketball moves solely for the purpose of a foul call. 

Trae's constant purposeful dribbling to get in front of a defender, then veering into the player's path while throwing on the brakes to cause a purposeful collision and repeating that over and over is a good example of where there needs to be a test that will discourage that play. IMO || People just fundamentally don’t understand how free throws work and it’s an easy thing to complain about when looking at a box score or watching a game, so they use terms like “ethical basketball” and “flopper” to glamorize not going to the free throw line and demonize guys who are good at it, even though being good at it is actually super helpful to your team. You potentially get points and get the other team in foul trouble, that’s a double win. 

At some level I get it because people don’t watch basketball for free throws, but getting to the line is a legitimate skill || Also, lots of players get fouled a lot because they're just hard to guard legitimately. Shaq took a lot of free throws not because he was a foul merchant, but because he was almost impossible to stop WITHOUT fouling him. Same with early career LeBron, same with Giannis. Among smaller players, that's also true of players like MJ and Kobe, they're so fast and slippery that defenders get caught out of position and the options are fouling or getting blown by. It's the latter category I think SGA falls into, as well as having a strong stop-start and fake skills that make defenders crash into fouls. || Play style is a huge factor in these numbers.  Absolutely.  More than anything, IMO.  Even if we acknowledge that NBA officials tend to not officiate every player exactly the same way.   And that goes both ways.  The way Lebron plays is a really interesting thing to observe on offense as he’s aged.  He used to look for contact more than he does no and it’s had some influence on his FTAs.  He also has become more of a jump shooter, and the impact there is obvious.   

And when I say avoid contact I mean that in the post he’s tended to try to be sneakier.  Plays a little like Siakam in some ways.  He will still bully people, but he picks his spots more. || its also really funny that people complain about how many free throws are being shot in the nba these days. despite the fact that free throw rates have been the lowest in nba history over the past few years || I get what your saying, but think about what you’re saying. “Getting to the line is a legitimate skill” is true, but is one the level of “flopping in soccer is a legitimate skill”. Rolling around for 2 minutes matters cause they only ever add so much stoppage time (partially for TV). Agreed that it’s beneficial, but it’s still a bitch ass move. Now whether it should be on the player or the league to change it is up to you (obviously the league, like what are we doing here NBA), but saying someone shouldn’t complain about a bitch ass move because it’s beneficial is dumb in my opinion. || Most people only watch highlight reels and look at the box score. 

A smaller guy who goes hard to the rim (SGA/Ant/Ja etc) is going to get the whistle and that's a good thing. That action is great for the fans. When Harden/Trey drive, their goal is to find the right moment to stop 8-15ft from the rim and draw a foul. That is unwatchable. 

Wemby exhagerating his fall is a bit annoying, but that is happening because he really doesn't get the whistle he deserves right now. Joker does similar things and is usually rewarded right away. I don't think either of them are flopping. Now Embiid crying after being grazed by the defenders jersey when he's already been to the line 16 times is annoying AF.

I love LBJ, but this is the first season where we are seeing a major decline. Obviously his style has shifted, but yeah. He barely goes for contact on the block or at the rim anymore. He's still getting a lot of credit from the refs on the other end. His non-existent effort on defense has made him reach in more and make some lazy hacks at guys driving at the rim. But he hasn't been getting whistled for it. Then again, he deserves it. The whistles MJ got on Washington were insane. || I’d make the distinction basically that getting pissed because a guy is flopping is fair, getting upset simply because a guy gets to the line isn’t, and that happens plenty || But what I’m saying is taking advantage of the rules (intentionally moving in a way you wouldn’t in order to make contact) is bad for the game. It does take skill, but it is also a bitch ass move. I use the soccer comparison because everyone can see that, but anytime taking advantage of the rules becomes a skill, well the rules probably need to be changed (and the player taking advantage of them is a bitch ass). || I guess we disagree here, if you can move in a way that forces a foul and you’re not snapping your head back, falling over, yelling, etc then I’d see that as a skill and it’s more on the defense for not being able to stop it and the rules for allowing it than on the offensive player

For example, if I’m in a triple threat position and you put your hand out above my arms in such a way that I can rise up, make contact with your hand and shoot while drawing a foul, that’s on you for being in bad position. Forcing a foul can be a savvy move and often is necessary because it’s what defense dictates || Hm I think there’s nuance here, because I agree with you about that. Cookie jar fouls have to stay just because they point out when the defender is “taking too much”, but I disagree that doing a pump fake, getting the guy to jump, then jumping into him is good for the game. Intentionally stepping out of your drive path just to bump into the defender is bad for the game. Players that seek out these fouls, that have made it their “skill” are making the game worse, but where I would agree with you is that the player has been incentivized to learn these skills. The NBA is most at fault for letting foul hunting be so incentivized.

Edit: the nuance here, in my opinion, is that cookie jar fouls are the offender pointing out that the defender is in a position that foul is meant to eliminate, where as the foul hunting, unnatural movement fouls are the offender creating the foul. || Pump fakes are tricky but I think it’s generally ok outside of the cases where the guys jump sideways to make contact. Most cases I think you can argue are guys trying to take too much on defense, being disciplined on jumping to contest is also a skill. The dribbling part I’m ok with in the open court, but it is almost impossible to cover screens if guys are going to stop and start randomly, so would be great if that was outlawed || Yeah, so I don’t have a problem with “foul hunters” if they are doing the savvy “pointing out the defender in a position they shouldn’t be” thing. My whole problem is many of these player (Embiid and Harden are the worst ones that come to mind) intentionally try to create fouls that aren’t in the spirit of the rules. It’s the NBA’s fault in my opinion for becoming too protective of offensive plays, but I also blame those players for playing a brand of basketball that sucks to watch.",0.204,0.667,0.129,-0.2023,0.038,0.838,0.124,0.9819,0.133,0.74,0.127,-0.9841
Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-02-03,nbadiscussion,1ih8rx1,Is LeBron Ready For Life Without the Ball? (OC Analysis),"Holy crap, the Lakers traded Anthony Davis for Luka Doncic. I’ll say up front that any possible quibbles about the Luka trade can quickly be refuted by noting that the Lakers got Luka Doncic. They’ve got a franchise player for the next 10 years, fit questions be darned.

I mean, there are some fit questions. If, on a very basic level, a team’s quality is (Offensive Efficiency-Defensive Efficiency), how are these Lakers supposed to win a championship with Doncic, Austin Reaves, and a 40-year old LeBron James playing more minutes than anyone else? Dorian Finney-Smith and Jarred Vanderbilt give them some sorely-needed defensive punch on the perimeter, but even an elite shot-blocker like Anthony Davis wasn’t able to cover for all of the Lakers’ defensive issues, and they just traded Anthony Davis. According to [NBA.com](http://NBA.com), James and Doncic are both in the bottom 5 when it comes to [average speed on defense](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/speed-distance?dir=D&sort=AVG_SPEED_DEF) — that’s not great.

Also, do the Lakers, who are currently 18th in 3pt%, have enough snipers to take advantage of the open 3-point looks James, Doncic, and Reaves will provide? (Again, Finney-Smith and his 42.9% mark from deep does help a lot here — that was already looking like a good trade, and it looks next-level given how superfluous D’Angelo Russell would be on the new-look Lakers.)

I was going to do a “5 biggest questions about the new Lakers” breakdown, but I can’t get one question in particular out of my head. It’s something I wrote about at some length [all the way back in 2010](https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/what-will-lebrons-game-look-like-in-miami), but honestly it’s been a pet obsession of mine since the summer of 2007. Simply put, what would a version of LeBron James who plays off the ball and values efficiency over all else look like?

If you ask someone to tell you the story of LeBron James’ career, it is very likely they will not mention his performance in the 2007 FIBA Americas Tournament, but it was something special to witness. Playing alongside Kobe Bryant and Carmelo Anthony (the latter of whom led the team in PPG), LeBron put on an efficiency clinic. Scoring primarily on opportunities created for him by his teammates, James averaged 18 points per game on *76% shooting* from the field and 62.2% shooting from 3-point range. Sure, the international 3-point line is shorter, but that’s mind-blowing stuff. The competition in that tournament wasn’t particularly fierce, but it was enough for an itch in my brain to develop that hasn’t really been scratched since.

We’ve seen a lot of versions of LeBron — there was the 1st Cleveland run, where he had enough pure athleticism and talent to run through the league. During the Miami run, he combined peak athleticism increased size, skill, and efficiency to become a kind of ultimate weapon on the wing. In the 2nd Cleveland run, his athleticism had waned ever so slightly, but he’d acquired enough savvy to control every single aspect of the offense from any place on the floor, whether he was driving, passing, or working from the perimeter. When he led the Lakers to a championship, he did it by embracing his playmaking and leading the league in assists for the only time in his career. Those are all very, very good basketball players.

However, my favorite version of LeBron may be the efficiency-obsessed version we’ve really only gotten to see in international play — he’s a career 61.8% shooter from the field in the Olympics. LeBron is very scary from a lot of places, but he’s scariest when he’s getting to the basket with a head of steam, and when he’s able to get that head of steam by working without the ball and catching it against a defense who’s not ready for him, it’s all but over. When LeBron uses his ability with the ball to get himself a shot, or uses his passing to get his opponents a shot, it’s a big problem for the defense. When he works without the ball and his teammates get him an open shot, it’s an Armageddon event. It may be less effective at 40 than it was before, but the version of LeBron that lets his teammates make *him* better might still be the one that’s hardest to stop.

LeBron’s never really been willing to play like the international version of himself in NBA play. As noted above, I thought it might happen in Miami with Wade as a dominant ballhandler, but Wade (who did start to show his age shortly after LeBron arrived) was the one who made the big adjustment, [becoming one of the best guards ever at moving without the ball and cutting for easy points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVbgpsc-SDk) as LeBron took on the lion’s share of the playmaking. Before LeBron came to Miami, 27.9% of Wade’s two-point shots came off of assists. In 2011, that number shot up to 37%, and in LeBron’s last two Miami runs it was right around the 43% mark. Meanwhile, LeBron actually had his percentage of assisted two-point field goals fall from 36.9% in his final Cleveland season to 28.4% in his first Miami year, and it only got up to 39.5% in his last year with Miami. The Heat would occasionally run the Wade-James pick-and-roll as kind of a nuclear option, and the Wade-to-James connection was [legendary in the open floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um-oQj5xfkw), but Wade creating plays for LeBron in the half court was never really a staple of the Heat offense.

In his second Cleveland run, Kyrie Irving’s brilliance in isolation took some of the load off of LeBron, and James and Irving being able to make a play at any time was certainly a headache for defenses. However, Irving wasn’t the kind of pure point guard who could unlock the potential of Off-Ball LeBron, and the two never developed a real offensive synergy beyond being individually brilliant and on the court at the same time. (In LeBron’s final, Irving-free Cleveland year, the percentage of his two-point field goals that came from assists was at just 30.1%.)

As previously mentioned, LeBron found his greatest success in Los Angeles taking on more playmaking responsibility than he ever had before. With Anthony Davis functioning as the most effective target that LeBron had ever had for his passes, LeBron had a career-high 49.1% assist rate and a career-low 23.4% of his two-point shots came off of assists. In the years that followed, the Lakers started to wean LeBron off the ball a bit as he finally showed signs of age, and in 2023-24 43.5% of his shots inside the arc were assisted. LeBron's also shown signs that he wants less time on the ball in Los Angeles, most notably with his full-throated endorsement of the doomed Russell Westbrook experiment -- one of the only explanations for that trade, and LeBron reportedly pressing for it, was that he was looking to share the load offensively and spend more time off the ball. 

This season, however, that number has gone down to 36.5%. So far this season, James’ concessions to age on the offensive have come not from taking himself off the ball but by maturing his on-ball game more — he’s focusing even more on posting up in the half court and is doing the best work of his career from midrange, with a renewed focus on his turnaround jumper resulting in him shooting an even 50% from 10-15 feet — miles above his career mark of 37% from that range.

LeBron has certainly shown more than a few flashes of how effective he can be without the ball. In his first Cleveland stint, it came on scripted plays like a decoy pick-and-roll that had [Mo Williams dribble along the baseline as James got a back-pick and surged from the three-point line for a dunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axGoRp2VkEM). (I ran ESPN’s Cavs blog at the time and named this play “The Kraken,” mostly because it was extremely funny to imagine Mike Brown saying “Release the Kraken!”)

In Miami, LeBron didn’t hunt for as many easy baskets inside the arc as I would have hoped, but [he turned himself into an excellent spot-up three-point shooter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWvTypNPWpc&t=114s) and embraced the power of the post-up game. In his second Cleveland stint, [the “slot cut”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA7nFXH6R_4) was added to his arsenal of signature moves, and you can see the skills that made him an All-State wideout in high school shine through when he gets separation from his defender on the perimeter and sprints towards daylight. In his post-COVID LA years, he’s added more wrinkles to his game as a roll man — he’s more willing to set ball-screens than ever, and he’s become much more comfortable as a secondary playmaker in Draymond-like “short roll” situations.

In the short-term, the off-ball brilliance LeBron has sprinkled into his game over the years will need to become staples if the Lakers want to maximize what Luka gives them. There need to be Luka-LeBron pick-and-rolls for days, he has to actively look for cuts when Luka (or Austin Reaves) is cooking on the other side of the floor, and aggressively work for deep post position if and when the threat of Luka forces a switch. He has to be willing to look for open space on the perimeter and embrace being a catch-and-shoot threat — even with LeBron’s improved three-point shooting, he still works more on “feel” from the perimeter than most shooters. For most shooters, the decision to shoot the three is a simple equation based on how much space they have, how much time is left on the shot clock, and whether or not there’s a better option immediately open. LeBron still likes to go by how he feels on a given play — there are times when he’s comfortable firing up a step-back with a hand in his face or pulling from 30 early in the shot clock, and times where he misses one or two and decides to swing the ball instead of taking a relatively open three-point opportunity. The final step on the perimeter would be taking a page out of his coach’s book and working around screens on the weak side for three-point looks while Luka has the ball, but that’s a whole other discussion.

If that happens, the 40-year old version of LeBron could become the most efficient one the NBA has ever seen, but it will require a mindset switch from LeBron we’ve really only seen on the international stage.

In the long-term, the arrival of Luka gives LeBron the clearest path he’s ever had to being effective and efficient well into his 40s, possibly as part of a championship team. The players who age the best in the NBA are the ones who have size, shoot well, and pass well. LeBron hasn’t shrunk, and is still massive for a wing, or a four in today’s NBA. His three-point shooting has become a strength, and he’s still got that generational court vision. If he’s willing to function as some kind of superpowered version of the Boris Diaw that won a championship with the Spurs, who knows just how long he can play? With Luka taking the load on offense, LeBron might even have some energy for the defensive end, where he currently conserves as much energy as he can. (I’ve been tracking every LeBron defensive possession for the last 10 or so games, and he still makes the plays that are “asked” of him — the issue is that, for energy conservation purposes, he puts himself in the spot where as little will be asked of him as possible.)

LeBron doesn’t have to go out on his shield like great perimeter players in the past have — if he’s willing to accept a smaller role (and, in the near future, a smaller contract), it’s very easy to imagine him sliding into the kind of spot Kareem did when he won his last ring averaging 14.6 points per game at 40 years old. Whether or not he wants that after playing more NBA basketball than any other human being ever has is another question entirely, but Luka gives LeBron a clear path to have a successful final act of his career.",101,46,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ih8rx1/is_lebron_ready_for_life_without_the_ball_oc/,2025-02-03 22:46:23,"LeBron has been ready since 2017.

For as bad as the Westbrook fit was with the team as a whole, his minutes with LeBron were still positive because LeBron utilized all those skills.

But it would make for some outstanding entertainment if they played small with Lebron at the 5 || Real question is how will LeBron, for the rest of the season,  play without a 6”11 eraser anchoring the defense.

Make no mistake: this is Luka’s team now. ||  What I want to know is whether the necessary adjustments (and roster changes- I think LA has to get some kind of center) will start coming this season, or if a proper offseason of adjustment and scheming will be necessary. I think Bron could just take a summer to work on catch and shoot threes, and he might come back with a significant bump in quality etc. Maybe AR would do the same…and I don’t see Luka magically losing 20 pounds over the all star break.

Maybe they can just make those changes sooner though? If anyone can it’s LeBron! || Sharing the ball will not be the problem in LA. As many have stated, LeBron can play off ball and his preferred to do so in most scenarios since 2017. He was an amazing starting PG in 2020, but it was too much for his body.

Also, Austin Reaves, who the Lakers will most likely not trade now, came up as an off ball player with some handling skills that were greatly improved, but he can def play off ball, plus would be a top 6th man in the league if his shooting motion speed becomes a problem.

Their problem right now is rim protection. For this team to work they either need an athletic rim protector/runner, or they need LeBron to play the Draymond Green role a la 2015-16 GSW with the death lineup. Or an expanded Iguodala role while Vando plays the Green role, or some combination of that with Rui. || Just so you know. He's not signed for 10 years... Not yet at least. What happens if he wants to test free agency? || >even with LeBron’s improved three-point shooting, he still works more on “feel” from the perimeter than most shooters

Even so, last season 177 players attempted at least 150 catch and shoot 3s. LeBron ranked 3rd in percentage at about 47%, only behind Norman Powell and Luke Kennard. He is absolutely a legitimate catch and shoot threat, and should get more open looks with Luka drawing so much defensive attention.


Having less offensive responsibility could theoretically also lead to LeBron being more engaged on defense and putting in more effort on that end... theoretically || I know it's a pretty different scenario, but people were stressing over the Westbrook trade to Nugs saying that it didn't make sense to have two facilitators (amoung other things like not stretching the floor). He would be the leader of the bench squad and that's it. Then what happened? Turned out having two great passers on the floor at the same time is...really good, and they play Jokic and Westbrook together all the time now.

These guys are pros. They will figure out how to work together. || LeBron loves a ball dominant guard. He basically just stands still on the wing resting/waiting for back cuts when he doesn't have the ball in his hands, so a high level shot creator is the ideal fit a PG. He wants the ball when he wants the ball, but when he doesn't, he needs someone who can do it on their own. Even more so at his age. 

This Laker's roster is well built for LeBron, barring a 3 point shooting center. Shot creating point guard with a bunch of 3 and D wings. If they can come up with a decent center they're as dangerous as anyone. || From a coaching perspective, Lebron should benefit from being off ball, that way you can monitor his minutes more and not have him involved in every single play, something a 40 yo would appreciate. 


But... we know that in today's NBA, the point guard/ball handler is the one that gets more stats outside of some elite centers. So idk, that could go against his overall statpadding antics. We'll see || He’ll still have it for 20 minutes a game. Luka will
Take 28. It will be good for both of them and keep the offense jiving non stop. || [removed] || You've missed the mark. The real question is whether Austin Reaves can adapt to playing without the ball. AR has been the Lakers' de facto point guard, dominating possessions and sometimes even outshooting LeBron and AD—much to LeBron’s frustration.

LeBron’s game isn’t changing. Luka’s game isn’t changing. They’ll play off each other, and it should work well because they’ll be faster, creating plenty of chances for both to get theirs. Think LeBron with Wade or Kyrie.

The biggest adjustment? Luka’s scoring average might dip slightly early on—he’s new and won’t want to step on toes right away. || I’ll save myself the reading.No he isn’t. He will not do off ball movement he will be a stand n watch player. Your turn my turn. They’re not a well paired duo especially when defense comes into it 

Post far too long to read  || People forget that he averaged 30 ppg with Russ on the team and 27ppg before Russ was traded at age 37 and 38. Lebron with a point guard will literally allow him walk up the court and take it easy. || I meant to put something about his endorsement of the Russ experiment in there (and I just edited the piece and put it in there), it's definitely a sign he's willing to go off the ball, at least in concept. And in international play, when he has the option to play essentially whatever role he wants, that's what he's gravitated towards. I wonder if he'll be as willing to trust the ball will find him when he's been so good controlling everything for so long, but honestly he's never played in the NBA with a playmaker of Doncic's caliber before. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || Luka will do what LeBron wants. That guy is his idol growing up. Dude waited outside of the lakers locker room to get his jersey signed. 

LeBron on the other hand will more than likely hand him the keys. || This is the more important question c I feel like it’s gonna be a clunky all the way into the playoffs and after. Lebron played with Wade and kyrie bro knows how to share the ball lol || [removed] || [removed] || What do you define as a bigger star? Lebron today isn't better than luka. If we are talking overall career and reputation, then you could argue that kyrie was already a bigger star, not at bron's magnitude, but he has a massive following and reputation nevertheless || La probably doesn't want to give up Reaves, but I think that's probably the right move. 

Doncic

That's the way to go. 

Do whatever needs to be done to get Bruce Brown. || The problem with Lebron off ball is you’re putting it in a worse player’s hands. That’s why it hasn’t happened much || Lebron has been very good this year as an off ball cutter. I think him and Luka should have a pretty high ceiling given that Lebron has started operating more out of the post, cutting to the basket, and spotting up for 3 more than he did in his prime.

Tatum (3500)  
Doncic (3600)  
Edwards (3500)

close but no: pg buddy hield kd lebron, mccollum.

I may be exaggerating curry's number but he still scores 4,2 3pointers per game. It's true that steph curry's record is not optimized which is crazy considering how much above everybody else he is. Curry has lost quite a few hundreds 3 pointers by being born before the curry revolution. Then he also played 3 years in college, also his durability has been very average, 2 big injuries + many missed games every year.\*\* But at the same time

a) it's incrediby tough to beat it. for example if you play an elite 1300 games (24 players in history, chris paul is at 1320) and you manage to have a 3,3 3 pointers per game, you are at 3900, which is his current number (3925). The thing is, currently, after curry (3,9) the 2nd highest is 3,1 (klay) and 3,0 (lillard) btw two players from his generation. some young players that now average around 3,0 can grow of course because they scored less of them in the first few seasons, but it's tough to imagine that it can grow to 3,3 or more, or maybe it can for a bit before going down this mark at the end of their career. Of course they could play more than 1300 games, there have been some guys at 1400, 1500 and even 1 at 1600, but that's incredibly rare and ofc average goes down as total games go up.

b) there havent been elite all time great shooters in the last years, or at least great great shooters that are great players or great shooters that seem to have great longevity. all the guys scoring a lot of 3s are not great shooters. edwards, doncic, tatum, mitchell, all go from decent to good (mitchell), for all of them elite shooting is not the main part of their game, edwards and mitchell are more athletic than shooters, tatum is shot creation at his height and versatility, doncic is overall offensive creation and playmakig. beside this edwards outlier season.

Steph curry's record can be broken, but there needs to be somebody in the league who's an all time great shooter and a great player and that will have great longevity, and for now we don't have anything like that.

\*\*it's tough to have it all, for example stoctkton has those unbeatable records despite not playing a lot his first 3 years, also playing 4 years of college, and also playing at least half of his career in a low pace era. james scoring record on the other hand is pretty optimized. he started playing at 18 when you could go straight out of hs, ofc he has one of the highest career ppg, the first 10 years of his career he played in a low scoring era but now he played more than half in a high scoring one. not totally tho cause he shoots less than other players + he didnt start in a high scoring era. wilt's rebounds record is very optimized cause in those times they averaged damn near double the reboudns and the guy played all the minutes",156,78,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ikd9gj/will_somebody_surpass_steph_currys_record_players/,2025-02-07 21:55:14,"Yes, it’ll happen eventually. 

Curry wasn’t chucking threes quite at the rate he is now when he first entered the league. Not to mention his first few years were plagued with injury. 

You already have players coming in shooting multiple threes a game while remaining healthy. ANT just earned the nod for the youngest player to reach 1000+ threes. ANT is already on pace to do it so long as he stays healthy, and there will undoubtedly be more players who come in who
shoot a lot of threes while remaining healthy

Will Curry be passed as the “greatest” shooter ever? I don’t think so any time soon, but his record will be broken. || Nobody in the league right now is surpassing him.

This recent wave of young NBA talent still was not fully immersed in the 3pt revolution. They may have molded their games around it in HS and college but it’s not the game they grew up playing.

Kids these days are trying to play Steph Curry’s game. It will still take a generational talent to overtake him but they will arrive in the next 20 years imo. || It’ll happen for sure. Curry could stay the greatest ever but he missed a lot of time entering the league late, being the one to revolutionize the 3 means he wasn’t taking as many as he should early in his career, and injuries. || If Silver pushes through with that 10 min quarter, then no, no one is surpassing him... || every record (except maybe wilts 100 and stocktons career assist record due to inflated stats) can be broken. remember, kareem’s record was thought to be unbroken until a few years ago || Steph is sitting at 3925 3PM right now. Let's say he retires with about 4800. That means someone has to average 300 3PM for 16 years. I think that's technically doable, but under the assumption that 3pt FG volume goes way up. Last year, Steph made 357 3PMs. Nobody else in the league made 300.

What would make Steph's record vulnerable? Steph was 21 when he entered the league, so someone who enters as a teenager has a few years head start. Also, Steph didn't even attempt 500 3PAs in a season until his 4th season, and didn't attempt 10 3PAs a game until his seventh season. Add in a few injury-riddled seasons and he left a lot of 3PMs on the table.

That said, if someone else ever makes 402 3PM in a season, I'd be astonished if he made them at a .454 clip. And I'd also be shocked if someone shoots .454 3pt٪ and makes even 350 3PMs. Maybe it can happen if the NBA pushes even softer defenses and teams averaged 130 ppg. || I doubt anyone can make 5000 3 pointers in their career. 
Hypothetically, let's assume a legend comes up at 18 years to the league and plays till he's 38.(Not everyone can be LeBron).
In those 20 years, he'll have to make 250 3s every single year. Considering how most players are only playing in 60-70 games each regular season, it's about (3.4-4.1) 3pm each season. There are 25 players who make more than 3 per game and 12 who make at 3.4 per game.
If you expect 4 per game then it's only 3 players.
Also, the highest ppg by a rookie this year is 15 and 3s is 3 per game.**
Keeping all that in mind, you'd need a  generational player being top 20 in 3s per game and can hit it consistently for more than 20 years and you'll still be lacking a little.
Now let's consider Steph Curry's ceiling.
He's made 3925 3 pointers till now.
He might add another 100-150 by the post season and then 500-600 on top of it.
He'll have a ceiling of 4600-4750.
That's tough to beat. 
The guy has to be generationally good, make 3.5-4 3s a night for over two decades and.... he'll still be under 300-500.
(4×65 =260. 260×20= 4200)
Steph is amazing. You have to realise that everyone shooting 3s might change how the game is, but even so, everyone is sharing the shots, so it's not one guy is making over 5 3s for a whole decade.
I think many will come close, like Ant. But...he's not Steph || Steph inspired a generation of players to bomb away from 3. His record will be broken || ANT has scored 1001 in 4 1/2 seasons. This has moved him from 2974 away from the record to 2924 away from the record.

A lot can change in the nba in the time it would take to catch the record. There could be 4 point shots and no corner 3's before he gets anywhere close. || Hard to say. On the one hand the league has changed so much that the conditions are currently more inviting for someone to come along and break the record. On the other hand, Curry is an extremely unique talent. We also don’t know how long this iteration of nba offense will last. If the nba eventually moves back the 3 point line, or at least gets rid of the corner 3, it’d be hard to see anyone touching the record || Curry had a special combination of elite shooting genetics and dedicated training from a young age, along with his competitive drive (which separated him from Seth). His own children may be the only people capable of eventually breaking his record someday. || It's gonna happen in our lifetime bud. Look at Ant being the fastest to reach 1,000 3's, there are only going to be more players coming in the respect these guys and want to be better. || Curry had 900 at LUKA's age.

Luka have 1300 already.

The rest will be history. || I think young players who will be chucking 3’s their whole career in bulk, from the start of their careers will overtake Curry.  But that doesn’t stop Curry from being the greatest shooter ever. || There are already quite several players on pace to surpass Steph’s record, we have rookies dropping 9 3’s in games already. Some players are averaging 3-5 3pms for the season. 

His record will be broken sooner rather than later but he knows this and doesn’t bother him in the slightest. || [removed] || While I agree with the sentiment someone will catch him there is context to saying Ant is on pace just for the fact Ant is chasing a hockey stick that’s about to kick up to the right.

From 24yo-30yo Steph made 2,113 threes. 

The race to 2k and 3k are going to be interesting to watch || 2011-2012 was the only year he really was seriously affected by injury. He played 80 games on 2009-2010, 74 games in 2010-2011, and played 78+ games from 2012-2017. || We need to realise that Steph was not a volume 3pt shooter in the first few years of his career (compare now) and he also missed alot of games due to injuries. He is not the fastest to reach 1K 3ptrs. 

Anthony Edwards already have 1K in only 300+ games. 

With the 3pt revolution, the guy who will break his record has already arrived or will be in the next 5 years. || Steph Curry’s first all star season was 11.5 years ago. Anthony edwards was 12. And he’s been in the league for 5 years. Risacher was 8 lol. Paolo was 11. Wemby was 9-10. These dudes definitely group up in Stephs shadow || Ant? He already has like 27% of Steph’s record and he’s like 22 || >Nobody in the league right now is surpassing him

That’s a strong statement. Anthony Edwards clearly has a chance if he plays long the like and doesn’t get injured. I’m not saying he will with that high of a chance but it’s clearly greater than 0 percent. 

No one should ever make absolute statements like this.  || The fact that Curry wasn't an all-star player at the beginning of his career will make his record more accessible to break. People forget that he's still a late bloomer since he joined the NBA in 2009. I also don't think it will take a generational talent to beat him. All that person needs to be is a 3 point specialist. || What are you talking about? Kids in 2016 were already playing Currys game. 

It's just that 3 pointers are hard, so nobody is going to close to it anytime soon. 

Lamelo was drawing all sorts of Curry comps as a young player. || Ant is on pace... we'll see if he stays healthy. Either way I don't really buy the premise that they needed to be indoctrinated into the way of the three as children in order to do it. || luka has been firing off steph amount of threes since his rookie year he is an easy candidate if he plays 8-10 more years also wemby shooting 10 threes a game || Luka, Trae, and Donovan will all pass Steph in career 3s made. || did you read the post? || Reboundings impossible, games just so different now || I mean. Records can be incredibly specific so no, there are many records that can't be broken. but even As far as career totals in the 5 major categories wilt's 24k rebouds is unbeatable cause at the time there were damn near double the total rebounds. also wilt lacks longevity but played all the minutes. and ofc he was an incredible rebounder. duncan has the most between players drafted after 75 and he has just 15k. if blocks were recorded earlier wilt/bill blocks record would also be unbreakable cause they were 2 freaks and there were so many more blocks because of shots being closer to the rim on average.  stockton assist and steals record is also pretty unbreakable, not because of ""inflated stats"" but because that's what you get when you combine goat level longevity (6th in total games) with 2nd in career average apg and 7th steals. So that leaves us with lebron's record. Lebron's record is theorically beatable because of the fact that lebron's career average points of 27 is one of the highest but not the highest, especially now if the average stay this high. but still it's incredibly difficult cause lebron will probably end up being 1st in total games played. Lebron will finish this season over 42k points, i expect him to play 2 other seasons, but 1 is also possible so lets estimate 44-45k.

Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-02-06,nbadiscussion,1ijwtos,Does Amen Thompson Even Need A Jumpshot?,"(Text from my post on a different site was copied directly here, so apologies for not having the accompanying videos and graphs mentioned)

After a hot start to 2025, the Houston Rockets have cooled off significantly and dropped five straight games. Even as the team struggles, Amen Thompson continues to turn heads with standout performances like his triple-double against the Cavs and a game-winning shot against the Celtics that made the media rounds last month. Since stepping into the starting lineup in early January, he’s fueled ‘budding superstar’ discussions with his excellent play. But while most of the talk has focused on his electric highlights and defensive prowess, one key question looms large: can he thrive in the modern NBA without a reliable jump shot?


Let’s touch on his defense first. From the moment he stepped onto an NBA court, Amen’s defense has been a game-changer. He’s making life miserable for opposing scorers using smart angles and great instincts, and his margin for error is exponentially higher than others due to his explosive athleticism. Look at this block on Evan Mobley as an example—despite being caught flat-footed at the time of release and giving up 5 inches in height to the towering Mobley, he uses his quick-twitch athleticism and he turns what should be a layup into an emphatic rejection. There aren’t many players in the league who make this play.


Per CraftedNBA’s aggregated defensive metrics, Amen is currently the third-best small forward in the league defensively. Advanced stats can be kind of a mess when it comes to individual defense, but Amen also passes the eye test with flying colors. Rockets coach Ime Udoka (whose intensity during post-game pressers make me think I’m the one who missed a defensive rotation) believes that nobody should be able to score on his star defender. Amen isn’t just a perimeter glue guy—he can guard multiple positions, disrupt passing lanes, and contest shots with remarkable timing. His defensive versatility is a huge asset in a league where wings and guards often find themselves consistently switching assignments on screens. The national media took notice in the month of January when he was recognized for his efforts by being named Western Conference Defensive Player of the Month (yes, apparently that is a real award).

Defensive accolades are cool, but we’re skirting around the question that dominates any conversation about Amen Thompson: can he thrive in this league without a jumper? Sure, guys like Andre Iguodala and Scottie Pippen carved out successful careers without lighting up from deep—but this is 2025. Is that even possible anymore? Look at this Kirk Goldsberry chart that shows you what the modern NBA is all about:


(via Kirk Goldsberry - if you’re reading this article you’ve probably already seen this)

Charts like this make it easy to see why people worry about Thompson’s shooting. The trend highlighted by this chart suggests that spacing is more important than ever, but it also underscores the value of someone who can get buckets in the paint. And Amen is an absolute close-range maniac. He’s shooting over 70% on shots at the rim - good for 13th in the NBA for anyone with at least 200 attempts. He’s a creative finisher with incredible hops, and when he gets a head of steam going downhill the stats say he’s damn near unstoppable. The F5 recently had a great piece on Amen’s opportunistic style of play—the rate at which he creates points off of second-chance putbacks, fastbreaks, and turnovers is sky-high—an integral part of why he’s able to succeed offensively without a reliable jump shot.

The analytics love three-pointers, but they love layups even more. A recent study by Syracuse University suggests that the NBA’s three-point revolution may have reached an inflection point. While threes remain valuable, the efficiency of two-pointers—particularly in the paint—has quietly surged. That’s not to say we are going to revert to early 2000’s-Corey Maggette-style 92-to-87 basketball any time soon, just that the modern shift of heaving it up from deep has opened up the space in the paint for close-range artists like Amen Thompson to get more efficient looks. While three-pointers still dominate the NBA landscape, the efficiency of elite finishers has gone understated as one of the most important parts of today's game. When evaluating player fit in the context of modern NBA trends, we should highlight elite slashers like Thompson rather than dismissing them for not being prototypical sharpshooters.

Amen’s game gets compared to a range of positionless tweeners from the NBA's past—Penny Hardaway, Shaun Livingston, Ben Simmons (back when he cared about basketball)—but the comparison that interests me the most is the man that most of us remember for his funky jump shot: Shawn Marion. The core of Shawn Marion’s game hinged on the same tenets that Amen Thompson’s does - thriving in transition, feasting in the paint, and playing suffocating defense. Their defensive versatility is remarkably similar - if you pull up footage from 2006, you’ll see a possession of The Matrix guarding Gilbert Arenas on the perimeter one possession and then switching onto Antawn Jamison in the post for the next. Amen finds himself tasked with the same burden - in a recent game against the Knicks, he was tasked with stopping both Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns on separate possessions. Not many players around the league would be asked to do that.


(via Statmuse - Amen’s shot chart is basically Shawn’s run through a modern analytics wringer. If Shawn Marion was The Matrix, Amen is shaping up to be John Wick)

It’s important to note that—despite wielding a jump shot that looked like he was aiming for a 14-foot rim—Shawn Marion actually had several years in the league as a respectable shooter; he made defenses pay for sagging off of him by shooting 33% from deep for his career. Yet, in a post-prime chapter of his career, he played a key role on the Dallas Mavericks championship team while shooting 15%(!) from beyond the arc in the regular season that year—and if that wasn’t absurd enough he took it up a notch in the playoffs with a whopping 0% (!!) 3-point percentage. It’s not as if the 32 year old Marion was a benchwarmer - he started all 21 games for them in the playoffs that year while logging 33 minutes a game. He was a key contributor, perhaps the second most important one behind Dirk Nowitzki, and he did it all without the 3 ball in his arsenal.

Amen, in similar fashion, is thriving despite a nonexistent jump shot. He does take the corner 3 when asked to - he’s shooting 33% on 40 attempts from the corner this year - but it’s not yet a shot that defenses respect from him. He instead puts defenses under constant pressure with the relentless pace he enforces when he has the ball, which opens up avenues for his playmaking and aforementioned great finishing skills. If the comparison to Shawn Marion shows us anything, it’s that players with a versatile, defense-first approach can carve out elite careers without the benefit of a reliable jumper. Amen has a long way to go to match the impressive body of work that Shawn Marion put up over 16 years, but so far he’s off to a fantastic start.

When discussing the potential of the 21 year old sophomore, the obsession with his jumper misses the point; Amen’s skillset is built for the modern NBA, even without a reliable deep ball. Would it help if Thompson developed a respectable shot? Of course. Any supplement to the offensive game of a budding young superstar could only be seen as a positive. But with the trajectory that Amen is currently on, he can be a great player without that addition. Maybe one day, he’ll add that jumper to his arsenal. But even if he never does, Amen Thompson isn’t just surviving in the modern NBA—he’s thriving.",62,71,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ijwtos/does_amen_thompson_even_need_a_jumpshot/,2025-02-07 09:56:33,"Depends on your goal. Win a playoff round? No. Win a championship? Probably

There is a way for a player to provide spacing while being a non-shooter through playing the dunker spot like 6 feet away from the basket on the baseline but idk if I like the idea of 6'6 amen Thompson playing there. Feels like he's gonna get packed 

Eventually in the playoffs you face an unwinnable matchup, where a dominant rim protector gets put on a non-shooting non-big, and then they get to roam off them and completely shut off the paint

Especially in the western conference where you will definitely play one of Minnesota with Gobert, Mavericks with AD, Spurs with Wemby, thunder with chet. In the east you will most certainly play the Cavs or Celtics eventually, which equates to death with Mobley/Jarrett Allen or kristaps || I think the issue is similar to ben simmons in his prime days. He was an absolute stud, all star player etc but sadly come playoff time due to lack of shot making the floor spacing in tighter defensive positions really hurt the team and he was delegated to the dunker spot. Giannis had the same issue early on which is that when the game is slowed down to half court on half court non shooters become a huge offensive liability. It’s no surprise that golden states best season was the season draymond was having his best season from 3 || He can be a very good player, even a star without a jumper. But if a team’s star player can’t shoot, it seems to put a hard cap on how much success that team can have. Giannis is the only exception I can think of right now. It’s an uphill battle when opposing defenses can cheat off and has that implicit advantage as long as the non-shooter is on the court. || Guys like this get schemed against in the playoffs in ways they don't in regular session games. Even Giannis has struggled translating his regular seasonal form into continuous playoff success and he's the ultimate evolution of this archetype.

He may be an effective player but it will always hold him back if he can't keep defenses honest. || If you'd like to read the post accompanied by pictures/videos/graphs check it out on my substack: https://substack.com/home/post/p-156644908 || [removed] || At this point essentially every player needs to be able to hit a 3 if they're open, at the very least. If 7'4 Victor Wembanyama can do it then Amen Thompson should be able to.

Numerous players started their career not able to shoot for shit but we're able to develop an *at least* semi-consistent jumper. Take Brook Lopez for example. So it's absolutely possible for players at this level to develop a jumper and there's really no excuse if they can't. || I think with a reliable jumper he'd have comparable potential to Raptors Kawhi, arguably with more physical upside. That would be best player on a title team ceiling (obviously that is a 'best-case' projection).

Without a jump shot I think the rest of his offensive game is much less valuable - like he will still have a high percentage at the rim but those shots are much harder to generate if you aren't a shooting threat. 

So I guess it depends on what you're trying to argue. I don't think anyone would say that he's in danger of falling out of the league without a jumper. But i'd argue being able to shoot would change his ceiling from like fringe all-star to possible top 5-10 player in the league. || [removed] || [removed] || [removed] || I worry most about injuries. The Thompson bros are built differently, but those explosive plays are just asking for something to tear. If he tallies up some soft tissue injuries and slows down, he could have a short career. || Yes, unquestionably yes without one he's severely limiting the teams half court offense come playoff time and that will always limit a teams potential success as that playoffs are a much more half court possession to possession game.

We discover this every time with guys who can't shoot and yet you will still have guys make posts like this whenever a new one pops up just for us to all be talking in 5 years time about how part of the reason his team never did anything was because teams could guard them by not guarding them come playoff time.


It's Been a thing since the rondo days and will continue to be a thing for time eternal.


It doesn't really matter how good your defense is if the most statistically effective way of limiting you offensively is by ignoring you up to a certain point and allowing your team to clog passing lanes that just makes everything more difficult then it needs to on a possession to possession basis and will lead to bad shots, turnovers ECT ECT, bassically all off the stuff that kills you come playoff time. || the short of is no he doesn’t need a jump shot but without one he doesn’t have the tools to be a true number 1 on a championship team in the current nba w the play style favoring space pace and shoot. that said amen is young as hell has plenty of time to fix his shot and also has every other tool needed to succeed. he’s basically a perfect number 2 option to any score first star player. take a guy like jamal murray for example. jamal is pretty much an offensive only player but if you had amen next to him suddenly amens strengths cover jamal’s weaknesses. or same goes for amens current teammate in jalen green or even sengun at times when amen is guarding bigger players. amen is the highest end second option where he isn’t going to be averaging 30+ like a harden but very easily could average 20+ and 5+ boards assists and stocks and be the piece that ensures winning games despite not being the go to scorer || Amens shot is getting better and as long as he continues to get better at shooting midrange and the occassional three he'll be at least a superstar level player if he also keeps up the defense and effort. || Remember; you win in the regular season by playing to your strengths. You win in the post season by exploiting the opponents weaknesses. 

Rudy Gobert/Draymond Green are defensive aces was left alone due to their inability to shoot. Amen will get the same treatment. What can he do to affect the game in the playoffs?

Ben Simmons is probably a good comp. 76ers had so much trouble trying to find a way to keep him on the floor. Embiid had to start shooting more jumpers to make up for the spacing for Ben. || Is Amen ever going to need to be that much of a scoring option that a jumpshot is necessary? Even at his peak, isn't the intention to basically be a supercharged Iguodala Swiss Army knife type, who can effectively play 1-4 at both ends, rather than a primary scoring option? If he's only taking 8-9 shots per game, and is mainly a finisher, he can get away with most of them not being jumpshots. || He’s one of the freakiest athletes ever. Probably the most athletic since first stint cleveland LeBron. On top of that, he actually knows how to utilize his athleticism. This gives him a huge edge over Ben Simmons. Simmons was a worse athlete but most importantly he was scared of contact and rarely aggressive. Amen is the opposite, his motor is insane and he’s everywhere on the floor. 

I don’t think he’ll be the #1 option on a championship level team without a passable jumper, but I think he can definitely be your #2 guy even if his shot doesn’t improve. || To be impactful in the half court offense you need to either be the screener or have a jumper if you’re playing off ball… or you need to be the primary ball handler & playmaker. I’d say he’s going to need to develop atleast a a strong mid range game or his man is going to be roaming free. || Every player needs a jump shot. The league changes constantly whether it be entire strategic shifts or rule changes or whatever. The one thing that does not change is the ability to put a ball through a hoop. You could have a career without a jump shot, but that doesn’t mean you didn’t need one. || [deleted] || He needs a shot because athleticism fades with age. By 2030 he won't be able to survive on athleticism alone, not to the same extent he can now. He doesn't need to be the best shooter on a team. But he needs to have good enough handles to allow him to create shots for himself in the mid range and he needs to be decent at catch-and-shoot 3 point shots. As his explosive first step fades with age he'll need to be a good enough shooter to force people to have to worry about closing out on him rather than just ignoring him when he's got the ball in his hands on the perimeter. If he keeps working diligently on his shooting he'll be a better version of Russell Westbrook i.e. he's still really useful in 10 years time. The jump shooting isn't about now, it's about futureproofing his career. The same goes for his brother. || People saying that layups are suddenly becoming more valuable don’t understand basketball. It’s becoming more efficient because teams have to space out their defense so much and are hesitant to leave the perimeter with help and rotations. So the better teams get at shooting outside, the easier their look inside will get. That raises efficiency. But if you just think oh man twos are worth more all of a sudden let’s change our strategy, it will shift back because now you aren’t putting deep pressure anymore. || I wouldn't think a professional basketball player need to bother learning to shoot basketballs at a professional level. Seems outside the job description to me  || Developing a jumpshot at the NBA level is fucking hard. It's really fucking hard, especially when you're someone like Amen Thompson who has historically (past season and pre-NBA) been a below-average 3pt shooter and free throw shooter.

Guys who later developed a jumpshot weren't as bad as Amen was. He'd need a much better shooting coach and more reps than any of them to even reach a mid-level NBA rate of 3pt shots.

I think it also comes at opportunity cost. He can still provide high-level value by maximizing what he's already shown us. His offensive rebounding is great, he's a great cutter, ELITE man defender, already an all-time athlete. Only based off my opinion, he has other skills that he can improve on that make him overall better, compared to getting a jumper.

Things like finishing through traffic, handling the ball, making connective passes, screen setting, acquiring a floater, getting a better free-throw shot, etc.

Obviously he'd be better with all that and a jumper, but as it stands, you only have so much time and practices, that I think an Amen Thompson trying to become an NBA level shooter, would be less valuable because of how much he wouldn't be practicing the things we've seen him be able to do. (edit: wouldnt be practicing them as much because he'd be shooting an insane number of jumpshots to reach a level where you'd want him to be shooting them in NBA games)

There are other ways to provide value off the ball offensively, and he's shown us he can do all those things well. || I had Amen 2nd in that draft class ahead of Scoot and Brandon Miller. I could pull my Reddit post from 2 years ago, but that’s a lot of work. The gist of it was that his median outcome was lower than those two, but his 90+ percentile outcome was superstar.    

I think he’s proven that he will be a star without a jump shot, but if he improves to league average on catch and shoot 3s, he could be in the “best player on a contender” level of superstar.    

As it stands, Amen is similar to the best version of Ben Simmons whose name is basically an invective at this point, but who was a really good player when he wasn’t terrified of the free throw line. That makes a world of difference. 

So no, he doesn’t NEED a jumper to be a star. He can be the best wing defender in the league paired with a transition/cutting/passing demon, but to elevate to true superstar, he needs to be around 35% on catch and shoot 3s at decent volume. || Self-promotion is not permitted with the exception of high-quality OC analysis. In these cases, self-promotion is only permitted in a comment reply to the original post, not within the post itself.

If you edit your post to remove the self promo link and place it in a comment instead, your post can remain. If not, it will be removed. || I dunno. In the post season, the game tends to slow down more. While he can still help on the defensive end, it sounds like it would be another story similar to the limitations Ben Simmons had. Amazing player with huge upside, but is stifled by his own ability to spread the floor || I think Amen has proved he can be very useful against the Celtics and Cavs (3-0 last month against them with stellar performances) but I can agree the playoffs are a different beast. I am not expecting the Rockets to run the offense through him, but I truly believe he can be a key contributor to a deep playoff run without needing to shoot a single 3 pointer - it's been done in the past by players like him. || Idk I think Amen is just way way smarter of a player than Ben Simmons ever was. I know some people may think because Simmons was a good playmaker and defender, that he was a high IQ player but he really was not. He would constantly get in the way of the offense in the way Amen never does. And on defense while Simmons was one of the most capable defenders in the league, he would constantly make untimely switches and basically try and force himself to be guarding specific guys.

**Transaction Notes:**

We can debate the merits of remaining competitive but once we accept that as a goal, there probably wasn’t a better deal on the market. Luka is a free agent in the summer of 2026 so whoever is trading for him has to convince him to re-sign in less than 18 months. Imagine a world where the Rockets empty the clip and trade Sengun + Amen + picks for Luka, why would he re-sign with that team with all of his other options on the table?

Luka is going to have his pick of any team in the league in the summer of 2026. Cap space doesn’t really matter when a player of Luka’s calibre is on the market. Every team will be a suitor. I’ve been following the NBA for a long time and there have been countless examples (anyone remember Butler to Miami being impossible because of cap space) of this.

If Luka wants to play with Wemby, the Spurs will make it happen. If he wants to play with Jokic, the Nuggets will make it happen. If he wants to play with Tatum, the Celtics will make it happen. If he wants to play with Giannis, the Bucks will make it happen. This is what the Lakers are up against and I suspect how they were able to hold back assets in the deal. It has already been reported that they asked to speak to Luka about signing an extension before the trade and were denied permission. 

The Mavs should have extracted more value from the Lakers (I think a trade of AD + Reaves for Luka would have been accurate pricing) but certainly not AD + Reaves + Christie + both picks and all possible swaps like I’ve seen others propose. 

**Luka Notes:**

Luka is out of shape for an NBA player. Yes, he’s still a tremendous player but I think the pendulum has swung too far on this. Citing his minutes load as evidence of his shape is silly, you can play lots of minutes while being out of shape, your fitness affects what you do during those minutes.  It’s a testament to his skill level that he’s still able to play as well as he does despite this but it is a real issue. The all time greats Luka is compared to had kinks to work out but nobody would ever accuse them of not trying to squeeze every ounce of talent out of their bodies. 

I have never read an article about LeBron, Jordan, Kobe, Duncan, KG, Giannis being so flagrantly out of shape. Jokic famously took a leap when he decided he wanted to take his body seriously and stopped drinking three 2L bottles of coke every day. Many hoped that after last year’s bitter defeat in the Finals Luka would come into this year committed to fitness and diet. Instead there were articles about him smoking cigarettes and drinking beer during the Olympics. Mavs fans will never admit it now but just go into their subreddit and type “Luka conditioning” to see their unvarnished thoughts. 

Luka has a lot of what I would call “non-winning” habits. He doesn’t impact the defensive side of the ball, he doesn’t set good screens, he doesn’t box out, he doesn’t move without the ball, he doesn’t change ends quickly, he doesn’t fight over or through screens, he’s never first to the floor etc. 

This is all great news for Luka because there’s so much room for improvement. He’s honestly barely scratched the surface of the player he could be if he became more serious about the game. The bad news is that we’re 7 years into his career and there hasn’t really been another star of his calibre I can think of that took this long to become “serious”. Many people say you either have it or you don’t and the Mavs had a front row seat to him and decided that he wasn’t going to change. Luka is well beyond Embiid as a playoff performer but Embiid is example of the issues that can arise when a superstar player never “grows up” and commits themselves to the small, mundane things that lead to winning. 

**Lakers Notes:**

The Lakers were closer to competing for a title this year prior to the Luka trade than they were generally given credit for. A lot of people wrote them off after their early season slump but since Dec 5th the Lakers have gone 20-9 with the #4 defence and #8 offence in the NBA. In this stretch AD/Luka (treating them as one player) missed 9 games.

The Lakers’ window is not as wide as people believe. Luka on his own without a second star is not going anywhere worthwhile and it’s unlikely the Lakers will sign anyone better than current LeBron. For example, the big star free agent in the summer of 2026 is JJJ — current LeBron is 2-3 tiers above JJJ. LeBron is 40 and his play is very much year to year at this point. The Lakers don’t have as much time as it may seem. 

It should not be lost on anyone that the Lakers did not skip a beat and in fact played better in AD’s absence. Anthony Davis is an incredibly talented player but his impact on the court is overstated because people have a tendency to think basketball is the sum total of offensive and defensive ability as if they are discrete and separate parts of the game. It’s really difficult to have a great defence when your center is a non shooter who mostly plays around the basket because after they’ll very often end the offensive possession near the hoop and therefore behind the play in transition or semi-transition. 

AD’s struggles changing ends was one of the largest under-discussed issues with the Lakers’ defence over the last few years. In today’s NBA it’s really difficult to have a non-shooting big be a large part of your offense because of how important floor balance and early transition defence is. IF Luka is serious about playing defence, I think the Lakers actually match up better against teams with great bigs because their center will be 100% focused on defensive responsibilities. 

All in all this is one of the most fascinating trades in NBA history and one that I think will challenge a lot of what has become “conventional wisdom” about NBA team building.

Is this why Porzingis shoots from above the break, so it's easier for him to get back on defense?

Is there a way to see the impact of how well a player runs the floor? Why is it so under-discussed? Is the impact really that much? || Why do we have to accept there wasn't a better deal on the market? This trade was bungled so badly that Nico Harrison could not even extract all of LA's assets. He didn't even get the best deal under what seemed to be his own self-imposed restriction that he wanted AD and no one else.

A player of Luka's calibre at his age has never been traded. We don't know how teams would react. Teams spend years building up assets to have the ammunition to chase stars if they become available. || I don't agree with your assessment of Luka's situation. In particular when you say he has a lot of ""non-winning habits""... But he still brings wins at an elite rate/level, so perhaps what we should reconsider if they really are ""non-winning habits""?

You cite Kobe, I think that's a good view on how ""winning habits"" can be unexpected. Sure, Kobe has an elite winning mentality and focus, and excellent conditioning. But he also clashed with Phil Jackson and with Shaq, to a certain extent being the catalyst for a team that had won 3 titles and lost one final in 5 years to break up. Despite Jackson coming back a year later, it took the Gasol trade to really bring the team back to where it had been (a trade that even at the time was seen as... favorable to the Lakers). 

Luka seems to be a pretty easy-going team-mate, and despite being a hugely ball-dominant player he's adapted his play each season to play well with whoever is on the roster. Isn't getting the maximum out of your team-mates, in particular in a small-market team a hugely valuable winning habit?

Are there ways Doncic can improve even further and be truly a once-in-a-generation player? Yes. Pretty much every player can and does. LeBron worked to add a mid-range shot after the 2007 finals where the Spurs highlighted this gap in his offensive toolset, for example. Would it be great if Doncic is 100% committed to improving his game to be this once-in-a-generation player, and agrees with the Mavs organization that his conditioning and defensive effort is the gap he needs to work on? Sure!

But the Mavs can't have their cake and eat it too. 

They're not the Lakers or other big-market teams that can attract stars. They've been to 3 finals in 45 years. 1 in 6 years with Doncic, who's not yet in his prime. Doncic was according to all reports happy in Dallas, which is an incredible stroke of luck. LeBron dropped the Cavs, just like AD and KD did to their small-market teams to seek rings/success. Getting a top-5 player for the next 6-7 years is *incredibly* good for a team like the Mavs!

Doncic might not have LeBron or Kobe's grindset mentality. He will probably never be a hyper-conditioned player like Giannis, partly because of this mindset issue, but also because athleticism isn't a major part of his playing style. But like Jokic, he has plenty of other skills / qualities that are much, much more valuable to the organization. You say Jokic improved considerably after shedding weight... Is Jokic at his ideal weight now? He's considerably heavier than AD, Markkanen or Wemby for example. Would he be -*even better*\- by dropping 30 or 50 lbs? Some would say yes - he'd be faster in defense, more agile and able to jump a little higher. Others would say no - he would lose some of the weight advantage that he leverages so well to push defenders back and create space for himself and team-mates. Similarly, would leaner, meaner Doncic be better for the organization, getting pissed off that his efforts aren't being rewarded due to the Mavs' limited ability to surround him with top-level players? Would it be better for the Mavs if he cut his weight for a season then leaves the team to chase a ring like KD or LeBron did? 

However you look at it, the result is that he's taken the Mavs to a final in his 6th season after joining the league at 19. He was committed to the team and reaching a level of success that the organization has had so rarely it's almost anecdotal. How you can square that with having a lot of ""non-winning habits"" as a reason to trade him is frankly surprising to me. || I think the most interesting thing is the Mavs are probably the best team ever to deliberately take a step back mid season with a trade.

Before the trade, they were a consensus second tier contender behind OKC, Boston and  Cleveland, together with Denver and NY. After the trade, the most frequent question was if they can avoid the play-in, and I haven’t seen anyone seriously consider that they can make the conference finals.

Moreover, this is an improved version of last year’s finals team, with more talent, deeper roster, and more versatile options for lineups and even play style. And it’s not like now or never, they had everything under control for 2 more seasons after this, with picks and assets to improve on the margins. || LeBron being 2-3 tiers above JJJ is absolutely insane. He is maximum 1 tier above. LBJ is an All-NBA level player, JJJ All-NBA/high level All-Star. || Every, single, fuckin time anthony davis goes for a layup, he goes flying past the rim on the and falls to the ground, and the other team if they are any good score in transition on a 4v5. || [removed] || It was the type of lopsided trade that would only happen for the Lakers. That is the most irritating part to me. Unlike most teams the Lakers never have to find superstars in the draft. If they don’t draft one, a superstar will just fall onto their lap. || Begs the question if Luka is this good out of shape… how good could he conceivably be if he was in his best shape? || A lot of someone's value is your ability to replace them. Dallas will never again have a player with Luka's insane combination of talent and popularity. That makes him priceless. Yet they gave him away for nothing (compared to other recent deals). Combine that with the unethical secrecy and the lack of shopping him around, it is hard to not be left with a sour taste in your mouth regardless of what team you support. The general feeling is Luka, who was the best thing ever to Dallas fans, was stolen. || Porzingas, Brunson and now Doncic. One season removed from making the nba finals to probably being destined to peak in the 2nd round with this squad. If you trade a guy that is probably 70-80% of the fanbase you better hope you’re replacing him with someone of equal value. The alternate route would be crowning else who’s younger or needs more opportunity your new franchise player (like Brunson) 

Mavs front office didn’t even try and stockpile a bunch of first rounders like Presti did for OKC. They haven’t really developed any young prospects so there wasn’t really a dual timeline.

Klay, Kyrie and AD would’ve been sick…9 years ago when they were all in their prime. One of the craftiest combo guards paired with an elite two way off ball 3pt sniper and a two way athletic beast with playmaking abilities in the front court. Throw in some quality role players around that and you have yourself a title team in today’s NBA. 

Mavs don’t really have an untouchable level player at this point. With AD in the mix they’ve really double down on old injury prone guys. Don’t get me wrong AD is still a top 10-20 player when healthy, but he rarely is. You’d think teams would’ve learned after the aging stars didn’t pan out for the Clippers. || I think long winded analysis is just an attempt to make something fundamentally senseless make sense .

Doncic is not a perfect player but he is a potential top 20 all time with 5-10 exceptional years ahead of him..simply put, with the right supporting cast he is good enough to carry a franchise to multiple championships and his value on the open market reflects that. The trade is controversial and newsworthy for the reason everyone thinks it is- because Dallas threw away a franchise player for far far less than he is worth.

There isn't some underlying logic to it, all that happened in this instance is a perfect storm of an immature and not very smart GM failing to appreciate that superstars often come with baggage or shortcomings and you pretty much accept that, an inexperienced owner who knows nothing about basketball, and  failed to appreciate the enormity of what he was being asked to sign off onand a much more experienced GM who was wily enough to leverage his personal relationship with that other GM to both sucker him into the trade and -amazingly-  talk him into keeping it secret to avoid the absolute feeding frenzy which would have ensured if Doncic was available on the open market.

Or to put it more succinctly. Nico is an idiot and Pelinka saw him coming. || >T his is what the Lakers are up against and I suspect how they were able to hold back assets in the deal. It has already been reported that they asked to speak to Luka about signing an extension before the trade and were denied permission . . . .  The Mavs should have extracted more value from the Lakers (I think a trade of AD + Reaves for Luka would have been accurate pricing) but certainly not AD + Reaves + Christie + both picks and all possible swaps like I’ve seen others propose.

Yeah I think that's what people miss - even a great player, there's only so much that a team is going to pay for what just a season and a half rental of a guy who hadn't played in 2 months. It was similar to why Toronto got such a good deal for Kawhi Leonard. In both cases the guy immediately got healthy after going to his new team, but that wasn't a certainty when the trade was made || Bro is expecting Luka to come out with a six pack… that’s not ever going to even be Luka.. Dallas main problem with Luka is he was skipping out of summer camp, he was always in shape just couldn’t find a rhythm I believe it was because he didn’t attend summer camp/pre game etc.. || I'll also throw out that the Luka trade made so many of Nico's prior moves retroactively worse. Like, if you agree to a pick swap when everyone in your rotation is going to be 30, then oh well. You're expecting to be, at worst, trading a late 1st for a later 1st. We've got pick swaps waiting to go off when just about everyone in the rotation is going to be retired now. || It’s crazy you’re blaming AD’s transition defense like LeBron isn’t the one trying to get him to sit corner and stretch the floor. Also like LeBron and the wings aren’t supposed to be the transition defenders. 

This is why Jordan’s Bulls were so elite. Him and Pippen took away transition opportunities and forced you to play half court basketball. This is why the Spurs were elite in 2013+ Kawhi and Danny Green dominated the transition defense forcing everyone to play half court basketball. This is also why the Celtics just won a championship… Brown and Tatum are taking away all the easy transition baskets, forcing guys to play half court ball… but on the Lakers it’s Davis fault for not getting back meanwhile LeBron (&Luka) are 2 of the slowest defensive players in the league. || This trade have 0 basketball schematics involved in it. 

It's a decision forced by the top dogs who we don't know about for money reasons.

This is a win for the league cause luka on the most sellable franchise in the lakers. Mavs ownership want mavs in las vegas and this is also a win for nba front office. Etc2.

If mavs FO announced that luka wanted out. They could've gotten atleast 7 first round offers from atleast 5 teams. mavs front office don't even need to ask cause great offers will be abundant. Instead they specifically wanted the trade to be with the lakers. || I don't think Lebron is 2 tiers above JJJ lol. JJJ is probably gonna make all nba and Bron might not. They're in the same tier this year.

Anyways you're right Luka playing next to Bron means he's gonna have to grow up. No more bullshit ""Golden Boy"" leeway. It's time to win NOW.

Lukas relationship with Kyrie was a summertime boy-ish friendship built on love of the game and doing cool fun trickshots in practice.

Lukas relationship with Bron is going to be mentorship and learning how to win championships.

How is Luka going to react to Bron losing his shit at him?

How is Luka going to react to JJ Reddick yelling at him and coaching him hard?

This is Lukas opportunity to grow out of his boyhood and learn what it means to win championships.

He made it to the Finals- cool. So did Dwight Howard. Honestly Dwight and Luka have a lot in common when you look at their resumes and personalities.

Bron doesn't give a fuck that you went to the Finals once. That doesn't mean anything to him or the Lakers organizations. 

Mavs fans treated Luka like a God because he took them there once. Well, making the finals is the BARE MINIMUM now. Chips are the expectation and I'm not sure Luka is ready for that pressure. || I strongly disagree with there not being a better deal on the market but you make lots of good points about everything else. 


Good post op || ""The bad news is that we’re 7 years into his career and there hasn’t really been another star of his calibre I can think of that took this long to become “serious”""
Man has more all NBA 1st teams than Steph Curry. He had ONE serious enough team and took them to the finals. My tinfoil hat makes me want to ask whether you're paid by Nico and his goons.
Reality is he's one of one. Only Jokic is better and only Giannis can even talk because he won and he is that caliber of player. But his game WILL age worse than Lukas (and Jokic)
Selling him is like selling your kidney and being like ""but Ive gotten $2000 in return! I really like 2000!"" || It really is. Two teams with looming problems getting together and solving it in the most unconventional of ways. Doncic may have been on the less athletic side, but that wasn't the real reason. It was money. They couldn't give him the supermax and realistically field a championship winning team.They were caught in a situation where most teams would be forced to dole out an albatross contract, hoping everything else just falls in place at the right time. Lakers mortgaged their future, and AD was looking more and more like a player that you couldn't make the cornerstone once Bron (eventually) left. He can stay healthy, but he's still inconsistent. He's every bit as likey to give you a 13 point game as he is to give you a 30 point game. LA didn't want another decade of offering bad contracts as they search for a star big enough to be attracted by the big lights of Lakerland. Two bros doing each other a serious solid. Lol. || You can drive yourself crazy with this trade because it makes no basketball sense to make it but if you look at it through the lenses of the owner’s motivations it makes more sense. 

The Owners are not basketball people, their biggest venture is right now is trying turn the AAC into a casino complex. But with sports gambling illegal in Texas they have to look for a different route. Since the NBA already wants a team in Vegas, the plan would be to have the Mavericks relocated to Vegas. Now it’s hard to justify moving a team that is consistently making the playoffs/finals with Luka because the fan base is behind it and making good money. But if the team is bad and the fans are not engaged with the team or even hate the team outright, discussions would be had to move the team to a market that will financially support it. What’s one way to piss off an entire fan base? Trade away your homegrown generational talent with no warning in the middle of the night so there’s no chance to sway the decision in the court of public opinion. So the owners are financially incentivized for the team to be bad and its value to go in the tank because it serves their interests and makes it easier to move the team. Notice how I didn’t mention anything about basketball involved in the trade. Because it had nothing to do with it. || [removed] || It's not fascinating. The Lakers are the premier team in the NBA. Everyone either loves them or hates them. Personally I can't stand them. This was a money move by the league to draw eyeballs. That's it.

It's not like AD and the Lakers tricked the Mavs bu hiding his injury history and not disclosing his current health etc, it was an accident and accidents happen. || The time to rescind a trade due to injury was during the physicals. If the Mavs' team doctors cleared AD and he then got injured while playing for them, what possible justification would they have for reversing the trade? || He cleared the physicals and got hurt on court and we all saw it.

It’s not like this is a 30 day money back guarantee. || Lol no. Just think of you can't ask for a refund when you are the one who broke the very brand new thing. Mavs are to be blamed. AD was sidelined and was projected by the Lakers for a return after the All-Star break. Am even surprised Mavs forced him to play earlier than expected. In this case 2 weeks earlier in his projected return timeframe || Its about if the Lakers hid anything, if upon his first medical, they found any issues that were unexpected/they thought they could not work with. This is my NAL-esque take atleast.

With Mark Williams, the situation is very different. The Hornets approached the Lakers and clearly tried to fleece us. Complete history, atleast of the foot/feet damage was not knows, and from what I have heard and understand, the Lakers medical team did tests that are not that typical, but which showed up glaring issues that even the Hornets did not know. On top of that, they played Mark heavy minutes, which may have worsened his issues. 

With Luka, we have been wondering the same thing, if the Mavs know something about his health that we don't. With regards to AD's health, I haven't heard any complaint and so would presume the Lakers provided all the relevant records, and the Mavs went ahead with the trade. I do not know where did you hear that his injury is worse than previously expected, so a source there would be nice. Also, it was up to Mavs to thoroughly conduct the physicals, plus there was a reason we were not playing AD AT ALL. 

We introduced Luka today, but keep in mind, we still only played him 24 minutes, even though he is younger. So your point here is very important, that maybe it was AD playing 30 minutes in his first game there. 

All in all, I am not sure if the trade can be rescinded at this point, given it seems to be, on PAPER, a legal trade. || No. They cleared him during his physical. If he happens to get injured while playing that is very unfortunate, but you can’t rescind the trade for that. There’s no valid justification for it. || Buncha nutball theories here.

Luka's history is a bit better but last season he was the walking wounded playing sub par at the end of the season right up through the NBA finals. He was tired and had little nagging injuries. It was that way before. Calf injuries esp. recurring are more serious than commenters here are understanding. 4th time. The Mavs will get out of Davis far cheaper than they would with Luka.

Then you have a legit argument. || I don’t think in NBA history has their been a trade that’s been rescind and that’s a unlikely scenario, I’m willing to be proven wrong cuz I’m not the best person regarding this topic but can a NBA team negotiate with the former about reversing the trade which would require mutual agreement and likely some contractual or legal maneuvering. The trade could be potentially voided if there was a misunderstanding or misrepresentation about the players health before the trade was finalized but AD was obviously hurt but AD brushed it off, saying it wasn’t serious before the trade took place  but it’s harder since the player played one game for their new team. The Mark Williams trade situation you mentioned might be different, as it likely involved specific contract clauses or medical considerations that allowed it to be rescinded. In this case with AD, I don't think it's realistic for the Mavs to reverse the trade without both teams agreeing to it, and it could have substantial ramifications in terms of relationships, future negotiations, and possibly the league's handling of the situation.

The ramifications would likely be financial (with salary cap implications), competitive (teams would have to adjust their rosters accordingly), and reputational, especially if one team is seen as backing out of a trade due to an injury. In the Mavs’ case, their leadership might face more criticism if such a reversal happened, and the Lakers could also face questions regarding their handling of the AD situation. || ""Accident.""

Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-02-10,nbadiscussion,1ime6jh,"KAT's defense at the 4, or KAT's offense at the 5 - Do we really have to choose?","**""The Knicks are suffering because KAT can't play defense at the 5, but if you shift him to the 4 his offense gets worse.""** I see this take floating around both the Knicks and the Wolves subreddits, as if it is a sort of ""pick your poison"" conundrum,  and I just don't agree with it for a number of reasons. I think the Wolves had largely solved the problem of KAT being a poor rim protector by adding Rudy Gobert next to him, and I think that should be the blueprint moving forward for KAT. 

However, when I ask people to elaborate on it, I haven't really gotten much of a concise answer other than a reference to offensive rating, so I want to dive a little bit into the numbers to see if that take really holds water. Specifically, I will only be looking at his offensive impact because he is a putrid rim protector, and I have no interest in proving that statistically. So in order to evaluate his offensive impact, I think we should evaluate KAT in 2 ways - the first being his individual offensive impact, and the second being his team offensive impact. So let's get into it. 

Side notes, I am not looking at offensive win shares because win shares are pretty heavily influenced by rebounding, and KAT's rebounding role was significantly smaller next to Rudy. I also don't think the 2022-2023 season should be an indictment on him either, considering he was out 50+ games from injury, started the season under weight, and he was adjusting to a new position. Although it was one of his worst years offensively, I still do not think it should carry as much weight.

--------------

**Individual Numbers:**

There are a number of individual statistics that we could look at to evaluate KAT's offensive impact, but because his role changed pretty drastically with Anthony Edwards, and half of his time since Ant was drafted was spent at the 4, it's a little bit difficult to identify which stats are more telling. I don't think PPG is necessarily an indictment on his ability at the 4. 

I think that **EFG** is probably the most telling stat of KAT's potency at the 4 vs at the 5. In 2023 - 2024, KAT had an EFG of .575, and his career EFG is .578. This stat is the first argument in why I don't believe that KAT is more effective offensively at the 5 than he is at the 4. If what people say is true about KAT being more effective at the 5, you would expect that the first full year he spent at the 4 would be his worst, but it was at the same relative averages of his career (Spent entirely at the 5.) He was also absurdly efficient in the first 2 series of the playoffs last year, far more efficient than any series at the 5. (In the Dallas series, it really felt like only Gobert and McDaniels came to play. Everyone else was abysmal.)

**His AST%** remains about the same as his career averages when he is at the 4 vs at the 5. I do want to point out that he had a career in assists during his first year at the 4 with Rudy, which could indicate that he is better at sharing the ball when he has someone down low he can dumb it off. That being said, I won't allow this to carry too much weight considering I said I was going to largely ignore the 22/23 season given how short it was. This year at the 5 is actually the lowest AST% of his career, except for his first 3 years in the league. 

**TOV%** in 2023/2024 was not significantly higher than it had been his previous 4 years at the 5. It is a bit higher than his career averages, but his first 3 years in the league were well below his averages - So his TOV% was far closer to what you'd expect from his prior 4/5 years. In fact, his TOV% usually rises with his AST%, as is an expected correlation with those 2 stats. 

The claim that I tend to see is that KAT's offense takes such a drastic dip, that it isn't worth putting him at the 4, but if that were the case, you would see some noticeable drop in his offensive production or his offensive efficiency when he plays at the 4 - but that isn't the case. The only statistical category which we can observe a noticeable drop in is his rebounding, and that can be explained by the fact that he was playing with Rudy. 

-----------------

**Team Stats**

So if his individual numbers aren't really that much worse, it must mean that his team impact is lower, so let's take a look. For starters, I don't think it carries a ton of weight to begin with because KAT's most successful team was also the year he spent the most time at the 4. The only argument I've really seen against KAT's team impact has been team offensive rating. In 2023-2024, the Wolves were a pretty middling offensive unit. Ranking 16th in the league, but does that mean KAT's place at the 4 was the contributing factor to that middling offense?

According to cleaningtheglass which adjusts for garbage time and possessions at the end of quarters that are highly likely to end up in a heave, league average offensive rating was 115.6 - and the Wolves were above that average mark at 116.1. So while they were 16th, they still above league average offense. This was also the best Wolves offensive rating of KAT's career, not accounting for relative team offenses. 

You might say that this was not a good number regardless, but if you look at this further, the middling offense has far less to do with things like team efficiency, or other stats that KAT could influence from being at the 4, and is likely influenced by 3 other stats. Those being:

The Wolves did not play with a ton of **pace** in 23/24. They much preferred slower games since they were so good on the defensive end, and they were efficient (Top 10 in FG% and top 3 in 3pt%.) Of course, offensive rating accounts for pace considering that it is points / 100 possessions, but teams with a higher pace have a tendency to have a higher offensive rating because it usually comes as a result of faster possessions, transition offense, and transition offense has a tendency to be much easier buckets. The Kings 2/3 years ago, and the Pacers last year are great examples of this tendency of higher pace = higher offensive rating. While offensive rating accounts for pace, pace does not account for the type of possessions, so let's look at 2 other factors. 

**Transition offense** is something that heavily influences pace. If you are running in transition, possessions are not only ending faster, resulting in a higher pace, but they are also resulting in easier buckets, meaning that the offensive rating would inflate. And the Wolves were not good in transition. In 23/24, Minnesota was bottom 3 in transition FGA per game. 

Finally, **Turnovers** would be another stat that would negatively impact offensive rating while not being reflected in pace. The Wolves were bottom 10 in turnovers last year. Pace does not account for a turnover ending in a turnover vs ending in a shot, just that there was a possession at all. While KAT was a massive perpetrator of turnovers, he has always turned the ball over quite a bit, and it isn't unique to him at the 4. 

Pace, transition offense, and turnovers are all things that would negatively impact a team's offensive rating while not necessarily being the fault of KAT, as they are stats that are usually influenced by either the team's lead guard, or a schematic theme. 

------

So, I want to dispute the notion that it is either ""KAT's offense at the 5 or KAT's defense at the 4."" I feel like while it's easy to look at his raw counting stats and say ""Well KAT surely does better at the 5,"" I do not believe that there is any statistical backing to that claim. Despite playing the 4 in 2023/2024, KAT remained one of the league's most dynamic 3 level scorers in the league last year, being hyper efficient from inside, the 3, and getting to the line a ton. 

KAT's offense drops off *very* little (If at all) while at 4 vs at the 5. But while his offense doesn't change that much from the 4 or the 5, KAT is a putrid rim protector and always has been, arguably one of the worst in the league (Especially in drop coverage) and so it does not make sense to put him at the 5. His defense is far more valuable at the 4. I think that last year, we saw the blueprint for how team's should aim to deploy KAT in the future. Considering he spaces the floor well, putting a non-shooting big man at the 5 isn't as punishing as it might feel. So placing a rim protecting big next to him where he can shift and be a big body on the outside is a much better role for him. We saw last year in the playoffs that he was a much more switchable defender, and was able to be much more effective when given specific defensive assignments like Jokic and Durant. 

I think that if the Knicks choose to deploy Mitchell Robinson at the 5, and KAT at the 4, we will see a similar product to last year's KAT, which was arguably the best year of his career considering team success, and his value on both ends of the ball. 

--------------

TL;DR: It isn't because KAT is playing the 5 again that his offensive production has surged, It's more likely that there are 2 contributing factors to him having a standout year offensively.

1) He has an expanded role and he gets more opportunities with the Knicks simply because they play faster offense than the Wolves did. He is also playing with an elite distributor in Brunson. 

2) He is now in his prime. He was never given a chance to be in his prime with the Wolves. It's pretty likely that a player having their best year offensively also happens to be in years players traditionally have their best stretch of their career.

Let me know what you think!",190,43,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ime6jh/kats_defense_at_the_4_or_kats_offense_at_the_5_do/,2025-02-10 14:09:16,"What you’re missing is who’s guarding him on the other team, which is really what matters when looking at his position. At the 5, he’s typically being guarded by a traditional center (who 9 times out of 10 can’t guard him). At the 4, that same center doesn’t have to guard KAT, so they’re typically positioned at the rim guarding whoever the team has at the 5. This allows them to be a deterrent at the rim for KAT, who doesn’t get a great whistle on his drives. In addition, PFs are usually more mobile and can guard KAT on the perimeter better. This means that they’re not afraid to step out on him, leading to less open 3s. If he blows by them? Meet rim protector.

This is one of the reasons that stats can help contextualize things, but it’s important not to discount the fans who actually watch the games. KAT is definitely still elite at PF, but there are definitely reasons why he is less of a matchup nightmare at the 4 vs at the 5. I can also dive into his defensive problems at the 5, but I get the sense that you understand that. || So one thing to keep in mind IMO is KAT in 23-24 had a huge reduction in double teams. Ant absolutely became the best player on the team & was the one being doubled the most. Idk if theres stats to back that up, but KAT hasn’t been great at handling doubles & that was one thing making his life easier that season. || He's playing more minutes and has higher usage. Jalen Brunson distributes more/better than Ant. Don't think it's more complicated than that. || There's a big difference in his catch-all metrics in both box-score metrics (O-BPM) and the plus-minus metrics (O-LEBRON, DARKO, etc.), when playing at the 4 v.s. the 5. I don't think any analysis can justify that as simply a blip. 

Using his career averages as a comparison is pretty disingenuous, especially when you go on to make distinctions that the first years of his career affect the data only when it affects you. When bringing up AST%, why not mention that his early seasons dragged it down severely? He had a 19.4 AST% in the four seasons prior to the Rudy acquisition (2018-2019 through 2021-22), and averaged 17.3 AST% in the two seasons with Rudy. That's not a huge one, but it is significant and meaningful. 

On TOV%, he averages 13.6% in those four seasons, compared to 14.4% in his last two seasons in Minnesota. Given he's never had a season above 14% aside from those two seasons, I'm inclined to believe that difference is not a result of variance - and 1% more turnovers is pretty meaningful imo, especially when you yourself say that assists are correlated with turnovers - yet he was averaging substantially less assists in those seasons.

There's also a point to make regarding his efficiency - it's important to compare relative to the league average, and when offense is going up as a whole, him having basically the same eFG as his career average (slightly lower, in fact) indicates that he's been less efficient. Looking at rTS (better metric for efficiency), he shot +6.2 in 2018-2019, +8.1 in 19-20, +3.9 in 20-21, +7.8 in 21-22. The two years with Rudy, he shot +3.6 and +4.5. That's a clear drop-off. from around +6.5 to +4. So his efficiency has pretty much dropped 2%. Supporting this idea, we can simply look at his lineup data with and without Rudy when they were both on the Wolves - KAT shot 64.4 TS% without Rudy on the floor and 61.2 TS% with him on. 

On the team aspect, I don't see how any of the explanations for the team offensive efficiency not being good stand up. Pace has very little correlation with offensive rating. The 2025 Knicks actually play at the 26th fastest pace in the league, slower than last year's Timberwolves, and have the 2nd best ORTG. Transition offense is mostly just an expansion on pace, and I'll just note that KAT isn't a huge driver or beneficiary of transition offense anyways. 

I also don't think it's fair to just ignore offensive rebounding because that's 'Rudy's duty'. The point is KAT's offensive rebounding loses value when he's played at the 4 v.s. the 5. This isn't a Rudy-specific issue, the same thing is likely going to happen with Mitchell Robinson at the 5. Considering ORB% is a decent driver of offensive impact, it's definitely a factor to consider when discussing the differences between him at the 4 and him at the 5. 

  
2024 was KAT's most successful year in terms of team record because there was the most talent surrounding him. The last time he had a teammate as good as either Ant or Gobert was back in the Jimmy Butler days when he was a second year player, and that team ended up making the playoffs and being the second most successful team KAT has been on (excluding the Knicks, of course). Does this mean second-year KAT was better than KAT from 2019 to 2022? Surely not. 

>  
Considering he spaces the floor well, putting a non-shooting big man at the 5 isn't as punishing as it might feel.

Yes, but you're missing something - it's not punishing in the sense that the spacing is perfectly viable, but that's not the problem. The problem is you're taking away KAT's superpower. Perhaps the biggest appeal of KAT's game is being able to attack 5s, which frees up so much for the offense. He gets to attack slower bigs either off the drive or with his outside shot, without having to worry about bigs lurking in the paint. His teammates reap the benefits too, with the shot-blocker pulled out to the perimeter because they're worried about KAT's shooting. 

  
TL;DR: There's definitely a significant difference in the offensive categories you mentioned when KAT plays at the 4 v.s. the 5, and it becomes even more obvious when we look at catch-all metrics. It's easy to take a narrative and run with it, but in this case the narrative is clearly backed by years of evidence and I don't know how you can deny that. || KAT played the 4 next to Rudy Gobert - one of the best defensive anchors in NBA history, of course his defensive metrics popped. || Honestly, I've heard less  about KAT's  game  being impacted but more so the Knicks' offense  being impacted. The  Knicks have  a  Top  2 offense while  being the  6th  best  3PT  shooting team in the   NBA  (%  wise.)  And a  huge part  of that  is KAT  at the  5  being the ultimate  spacing cheat code.   
 
4/5 Knick starters are shooting above average from 3  with the  ""worst"" one being Josh  Hart at 34.3%. Basically,  it's  a lot harder to help vs the Brunson drive knowing he  has  4  other options  who are good/deadly  from 3. [Among PnR players, Brunson comes in with the 2nd highest PPP at 1.09](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/ball-handler?CF=POSS*GE*5&dir=D&sort=PPP) behind only Shai.   
 
On the other side of the KAT/Brunson combo, [KAT is ranked 3rd in  roll game per PPP](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/roll-man?CF=POSS*GE*2&dir=D&sort=PPP) behind Allen and Jokic.  [The  Knicks rank 4th in spot  ups by PPP](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/spot-up?dir=D&sort=PPP)  
  
Logically, it all makes sense  why this offense  is so deadly. There's no  real weak  points on the offense. But if you're  bringing  Mitch in to clog  up  the spacing, you can't expect it to not  have a negative effect on the offense. || Pretty interesting stuff. Tbh smth that Kat did well last year was throwing lobs to gobert, like very well, and prob is smth him and Mitch could emulate.

I do think that Kat at the 5 just opens up the floor more for everyone else on this Knicks team especially, but clearly the stats don’t fully support that. I’m rly excited to see Mitch and Kat play together, Idt they will start immidiately w each other but if it goes well like u predict maybe they do start w each other. || Excellent write up, it's too bad he's so banged up that he barely resembles the player from earlier in the season.  Props to him for gutting it out, but he hasn't been the same player since his thumb injury. And his knee issues don't help either.  Mitchell Robinson is going to be huge in getting Kat some rest and games off down the stretch. || [removed] || Seems like a simple answer considering the Warriors prioritized Draymond Green defense and offensive point man abilities at 4 over scoring of any kind and they have won many many rings doing so. Take the defense and don’t think too much about it. || I totally agree with your points! The whole ""pick your poison"" idea just doesn't hold up when you break down KAT's numbers and role. His offensive efficiency doesn't really dip when he's at the 4, and in fact, he becomes a more versatile defender next to a rim protector like Gobert. You’re also spot on about the Wolves' offensive struggles being more related to pace, turnovers, and transition play than KAT's positioning.

I like how you emphasized that his role with the Knicks, alongside an elite distributor like Brunson and in a faster offense, is giving him more opportunities to shine. Plus, the fact that he's entering his prime makes his offensive production this season even more believable.

In the end, it seems like the blueprint for KAT is exactly what you described—having him play the 4 and pairing him with a solid rim protector at the 5. That’s where he can make the most impact without the defensive liabilities he has at the 5. Well thought out analysis! || [deleted] || [removed] || A lot of teams had shifted to the Utah defense style on him.   Put their 4 on him and send help in post up situations as required. || This has been my thinking as well. I love what Mitch brings from a defense and offensive rebounding standpoint. I wish he had better hands though when it comes to receiving passes. He’ll probably have plenty of opportunities for close open looks if KAT can get to the rim and the 5 has to move off Mitch to defend the drive.

Completely agree regarding the KAT offensive side of it. With 5’s they either play him a step back to try and avoid getting beat on the drive or play up and he blows by them. Having that 5 in the paint to defend the drive takes away a big part of his offense. Mitch clogs the paint. I’m sure we’ll see that lineup but I wouldn’t expect it to be the starting 5. || Regardless of who is guarding him, whether it be the 5 or another 4, KAT is remains about the same level of efficiency at all 3 levels. If it were true that 4's were guarding him better, we would see a significant drop in his efficiency. The only offensive drop we really can observe is in his FTr. 

And yeah, I'm a huge Wolves fan and have watched almost every game over the last 4/5 years so this is stats helping contextualize the eye-test. || That would absolutely be something worth looking at but I don't have the numbers for that either. I don't really know where I'd go to look for those. || Funnily enough, his usage is actually lower this year than it was last year (not by much) but it definitely doesn't help my case. || First off, I want to say that I appreciate the write up. This is what I was looking for; someone to meaningfully engage with each of the points that I talked about and you did. That being said, I agree with some stuff and disagree with others. But one thing I certainly disagree with, and I touch on a bit is that I do not believe that catch all stats are a good reference here considering his role changed drastically with Rudy, and thus his stats did. 

Unless I'm misinformed on the formulas, catch all stats weigh rebounding pretty heavily on both ends - and that is why I discount rebounding. Not because ""It's Rudy's job,"" but because the sheer volume of rebounding that KAT had to do at the 4 would artificially deflate the impact he provides when those formulas do their calculations. An example of this is win shares, and I know specifically that basketball-reference had to adjust their catch-all formulas because Russell Westbrook was considered the best defensive player in history according to their formula because his rebounds were so insane, which is obviously not true. Nikola Jokic's defensive shortcomings are also scrubbed a bit due to those formulas weighing rebounding. Comparing those catch-all stats year over year for KAT would be disingenuous because KAT's role changes. 

We'll start with career distinctions - the only stat I went on to make a distinction about regarding his first years in the league vs the remainder of his career was turnover rate because they are such drastic outliers comparatively to the remainder of his career. I don't know if that's disingenuous so much as his worst year is closer to his average than his best year is. We could throw out his best and his worst year and then his time at the 4 is far closer to his expected turnover rate. If I did include his first year with Rudy, it would also completely boost his assist rate. 

As far as efficiency, I suppose that's fair but I've also repeatedly indicated that his first year with Rudy should be considered more of an outlier considering the context of that season (coming into the season underweight, missing 53 games, and adjusting to the 4 for the first time) meaning that if we only account for his second season with Rudy, +4.5, while lower than the average, is still higher than some of his other seasons at the 5. If it were true that his offensive potency drops, you would expect his seasons at the 4 would be his absolute worst seasons, which they are not. It seems far more in line with a regular fluctuation of a player's efficiency year over year. 

For team aspect, I said I don't think that offensive rating is a good marker for KAT's impact on the team because offensive rating is influenced by stats that are not necessarily due to KAT's role, but moreso the lead guard or the scheme. Turnovers are a great example of this, being that the Wolves had a horrific turnover% last year, and that certainly played into the poor offensive rating, since while offensive rating accounts for pace, pace does not account for turnovers. 

Furthermore, I reference pace not as an indicator of offensive rating, but more like a barometer, and there absolutely is correlation - I would argue the Knicks are more of an exception than they are the rule. I said that team's have a *tendency* to have a higher offensive rating when they have a higher pace because of transition offense, which I do not think is fair to just call an ""expansion on pace."" It can't be considered just an expansion because the efficiency of them is so different. League average FG% is .465 this year, and while I can't find the exact number for league average transition FG%, it seems to be around 53-54%, significantly higher than regular FG%. And teams are taking about ~20 transition attempts a game on average, which would equate to about 1/5 of total possessions, I don't know how that could be considered insignificant. If the Wolves are simply not taking as many transition attempts (They aren't taking as many as other teams), it would not reflect in their offensive rating, but it would reflect in their pace. 

-----

My point is this: While there is a very slight drop in KAT's offensive potency when he plays the 4, I do not think it is enough to justify putting him at the 5 where he has to deal with his biggest shortcoming - he is a putrid rim protector. Like, arguably worst in the league of starters. It makes sense to place him at the 4 where he has a marginal drop in production, where you can hide him easier and give him more specific defensive assignments. 

You claim the drop-off is significant, but on both the team and the individuals numbers you've provided, they are like 2-3% changes, if that. That's a pretty marginal drop-off, and we see that level of change frequently within players year-over-year. It could easily be justified and explained that it's a standard fluctuation within the context of a career, as opposed to a change in position. || Yeah and I don't think it needs to be all game either. Having KAT play staggered minutes, some at the 4 and some at the 5 was a pretty common tactic last year. Chris Finch would just switch defensive schemes depending on which role KAT was playing.

So if KAT plays 36 minutes per game, maybe 20 of those could be with Mitch, give or take some. Mitch wouldn't even have to start. Maybe KAT sits after 8 minutes then starts the 2nd quarter with the Knicks second unit || He was an extremely good player across the first 2 series last year after coming back early from surgery. He only fizzled out in the Dallas series when 

1) everyone else was awful and 

2) he was tired which can likely be explained by him coming back early and having just played a 7 game series vs Denver.

Bad playoff players are bad until they prove they can be good and KAT certainly proved he could play some winning basketball. || We removed your comment for being low effort and low quality. || Didn’t mean to downplay your viewing stats, I just don’t think the efficiency stat is a perfect stat that explains how good a player is in totality. 

I think you’re missing my point about that rim protector being pulled out the paint with KAT at the 5 affects teams. I also think Mitchell Robinson at the 5 would be great for the Knicks, but being able to go 5 out is a great option for the Knicks when OG is back healthy. KAT is a great passer (was the best on the wolves imo) so that helps him at the 4, but the lack of spacing (unless he becomes strictly a floor spacer which I don’t like) hurts the team overall. I think they go forward with him at the 4 in the future but a JJJ/Giannis mold 4 would be the ideal front court partner imo. || Even though this doesn’t directly impact his own stats, KAT at the 5 allows the Knicks to play a truly 5 man out game. If he’s at the 4 and Mitch is at the 5, teams can stack the paint. With Hart at the 4, the Knicks have 5 legit players who can hit the open 3 or drive to the hoop. || The other thing i didn’t like about KAT at PF (& this is just observational so i could be wrong) was it seemed to increase his drives where he fell trying to draw a foul 🙄 and lead to fast break points at a very high clip on other end. Jim Pete used to bring it up all the time.  Idk if thats 100% related to C/PF but increased in frequency around the time we got Rudy.

Thats one of the biggest holes in KATs game at least in MN, always grabbing/holding trying to draw fouls and more often then not getting (rightly) called on him. His trying to play the foul game absolutely back fires on him in a major way, hurting his value.  Idk if thats still happens in NY but was the biggest issue with him here.  Just was very low IQ. || I probably shouldn't have used the term usage because Usage rate includes TO's. His last year rate was only higher because his TO rate was higher. I mean that he gets to shoot the ball and touch it more. Maybe more involved is the better word. || The reason why I mentioned both box score metrics and plus/minus based metrics was to cover both bases - even if the box score metrics did overweigh rebounding, there's no reason to believe that purer plus/minus metrics or even hybrid metrics would do the same, or at the very least the effect would be much weaker. On/off is a noisy stat, but we can see the in the two seasons he played with Rudy he had an on/off of -0.73, and in the prior 4 seasons his on/off was +7.90. Again, this is a noisy stat that's influenced by his teammates getting better, but it serves as an example to show that there are metrics that completely ignore rebounding that judge his impact as worse in those two seasons. More sophisticated metrics to account for lineup adjustments, or the different versions of RAPM out there, also reflect a clear difference in impact. Hybrid metrics, which would only incorporate rebounding numbers as part of a box prior for the RAPM calculation, also agree on this. It's a pretty universal phenomenon. 

By the way, I think it's a bit of a myth that catch-all metrics overvalue rebounds - in some ways, they do, yes, but only because there aren't any defensive box score metrics that serves as a good proxy of defense. Both your examples of rebounding inflating box score have to do with the defensive side of the metrics, and when there isn't any reliable proxy of defensive player impact in the box score (STL% and BLK% are both flawed in that regard, and Jokic/Westbrook both perform well in those metrics anyways), you're forced to rely more on defensive rebounds. On the offensive side, however, we can weight metrics such as points, assists, turnovers, efficiency, which give us a pretty good idea of offensive impact. It's why O-BPM lines up much more with the 'eye test' than D-BPM, and since we're discussing offensive impact here, I think it's fair to use O-BPM, which gives a generally accurate view of offensive impact. 

I think AST% was a much more drastic outlier than TOV% when comparing his first years of his career against all other seasons. I don't have a problem with you contextualizing his TOV%, I just find it weird that you didn't do the same for AST% when it was a bigger outlier. In general, I think it's far better protocol to compare a time period which better represents who he currently is as a player playing at the 5 against his two seasons at the 4 (which is what I did when I took the period between 2019 and 2022), and doing so would still yield a clear increase in TOV% and decrease in AST%, and I did indeed include his first year playing with Rudy when I brought up the 19.4% v.s. 17.3% which did in fact inflate his AST% (from 15.1 to 17.3). 
> If it were true that his offensive potency drops, you would expect his seasons at the 4 would be his absolute worst seasons, which they are not.

Aside from 2021, they are in fact his absolute worst seasons. He's played 10 seasons in the league, and has consistently posted rTS of over +6, yet 2 of his 3 worst seasons are the only seasons he played at the 4. Does that look like 'natural fluctuation'? Even if you only take the +4.5 from his second season with Rudy, it still doesn't come anywhere close to the +6 he consistently posts when playing at the 5. It's not higher than 'some' of his seasons at the 5, it's higher than precisely one season - out of 8. Note that him not playing many games in the 2022-23 season has already been weighted in the numbers. You may think it should be weighted even less due to the circumstances which is entirely fair, but even ignoring it completely still shows a clear difference - 23-24 is the second worst season (3rd worst if including 22-23) of his career in terms of efficiency, with no other season coming even close (within 1.5%). 

I don't think team ORTG is a good way to look at a player's impact on his team offense because it's affected by 10 other players on the team, and I understand you were pushing back against the same idea, which I do agree with. I simply don't think the explanations for his team offense being worse hold up - from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/18v72in/a_correlation_analysis_between_pace_efficiency/) post, there was a 0.02 correlation between pace and ORTG for the 2023-24 season, and a -0.26 correlation for the 2022-23 season. Two anecdotes don't change that. The point about transition offense is fair, though I'd argue that KAT playing at the 4 directly contributes to a worse transition offense - you have fewer players that can push the pace. 

I don't think you can explain the marginal changes in AST% and TOV% with 'standard fluctuation'. A lot of fluctuation can be explained by change in role. In this case, we're comparing averages over 4 seasons and 2 seasons - that should be more than enough of a sample size where the effects of variance are minimal. Plus, KAT has been remarkably consistent in those aspects, most notably TOV% where he had 4 straight seasons between 13.2% and 13.7%. To see that number suddenly jump to 15% and 14.1% doesn't seem like natural fluctuation to me. Same with AST% - he's been constantly above 17% since 2019, but it dropped to 15% in 2024. That's best explained by a shift in role imo. And those differences aren't the largest, but they're not insignificant either, and it all adds up. Increases in AST%, decreases in TOV%, increases in rTS%, especially when you factor in the offensive rebounding, it all contributes to his offensive impact. 

I agree he's best at the 4. What I don't agree with is the idea that his current production and offensive impact will maintain with him at the 4. Most likely, we'll see a significant drop. All of this isn't an indictment on KAT whatsoever: (perimeter) players simply become better offensively relative to position when asked to slide down, because the average center isn't as valuable as the average guard on offense. There's better spacing and better ball-handling, and that opens up a lot. In KAT's case, attacking from the perimeter (his FTA/100 has also seen a rise at the 5). We saw it happen with LeBron a couple years ago. KAT isn't immune to this. The issue here is moreso his inability to play the 5 in playoff settings, where he gets hunted on defense. That means it is kind of a 'KAT offense at the 5' v.s. 'KAT defense at the 4' situation, where I believe the defensive tradeoff tends to be better in the playoffs. || If your takeaway is that KAT only fits as part of a top tier championship contender if he's the 4 in your starting and closing lineup I agree.

The problem is when at the 4, he plays like a borderline All-Star, and he's getting paid like a perennial All-NBA player. || I tend to disagree with the idea that one playoff year like last year proves KAT is not a bad player in the playoffs.

His play off numbers always drop compared to his regular season, given the amount of money he’s on even as a second option he should be be able to step up when others are struggling, look at the Celtics last year where jaylen brown was incredible in both the ECF and the finals. KAT is yet to have a moment like that in his career, hopefully the change of teams resets both him and Randle who both have these playoff struggles. || A player like JJJ or Giannis truly would be the dream partner for KAT.

I've been seeing alot of talk about clutch time stats and using them as ways to discredit or discuss the chances of teams such as the Rockets (negatively) or Nuggets (positively) based on these metrics. 

The Wolves have played 34 clutch games, the most in the NBA but have only played 116 minutes of clutch time, which seems far too little to draw any significant information from.

Last year, the Wolves were 2nd in 4th quarter net rating despite their 26th ranked clutch net rating stats and then went on to perform extremely well in the clutch against Denver (one of the most clutch teams in the NBA) and terribly in the clutch against the Mavs (also one of the best).

My immediate thought is that perhaps teams have playstyles which are more suited to macro vs micro situations. For example, Anthony Edwards taking a stepback 3 which he makes at 37% is great offense, but when you need a one off shot its inferior to Jokic's 65% floater despite them having similar values in the bigger picture.

But then, teams like Boston and New York which shoot lots of 3s, are very high up in clutch stats for example, meaning that it isnt just influenced by the variability of shots.

The biggest thing clutch situations seem to impact for some players is that it affects their shoot/pass decisions.

To me if you want to know what teams will perform well in the clutch you need to look at roster construction. There’s a lot to that but on each side of the ball the main points imo are:

Offense - Who is your best player, how well can they generate for themselves and others in tight space. How many other players do you have who can do that to a lesser extent. How well do your off ball players punish closeouts. 

Defense - Who is your worst defender, are they frequently disadvantaged against their own matchup. Do you have any other players that fall into that latter category.

Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-02-21,nbadiscussion,1iviucw,A statistical breakdown of the Jimmy Butler Warriors,"We are 5 games into the Jimmy Butler Warriors Era. Let's take a look at these early returns from this small sample of games.

The Warriors are 4-1. They are blessed with a relatively weak remaining schedule strength (22nd toughest remaining). 

120.2 OffRtg (≈2nd currently in NBA) 
107.8 DefRtg (≈2nd currently in NBA) 
12.4 NetRtg (≈2nd currently in NBA)

DunksAndThrees (EPM): 7th Net, 6th@Full-Strength (aka when Kuminga comes back).

How's Steph doing now that he has a Butler? 28.8ppg/5.4ast/4.2 reb on 47/40/84 splits.

Over this 5 game span he's at 6th OffRtg & 8th NetRtg in the NBA. Wow.

Per DunksAndThrees Steph is currently 4th in OffEPM and 12th in EPM on the season.

Seems like the game is opening up for Steph with Jimmy around. Here's some proof. Check out Steph's shot diet from 3.

Before: Open 3s: 33.4% frequency. Wide Open 3s: 15.9% freq. 49% Open or Wide Open 3s.

w/ Jimmy: Open 3s: 39.8% freq. Wide Open 3s: 18.1% freq. 58% 3s Open or Wide Open 3s.

~10% better! The Chef is cooking and The Butler is serving.

Given the Warriors relatively weak remaining schedule strength (22nd) and the fact that the Lakers, Nuggets, Grizzlies, Clippers, Suns, and Kings are all in the Top 10 in remaining schedule strength, the 6th seed, while tough to get to, is a real possibility. They will just have to keep up this momentum and take advantage of their weak remaining schedule strength.

Here's a fun fact from my deep dive on Post All-Star Break teams. Well, fun if you're not a Lakers fan. Per DunksAndThrees, The Lakers only have 10 games with ≥ 55% win probability for the rest of the season. They really could fall into the Play-In if they don't figure things out quickly enough.

Going 2-2 against the Jazz (2x), Hornets, and Blazers could be a sign of future danger for them. They seem to be built to win NEXT season when they can properly retool around Luka, as opposed to this season when they're relying on Jaxson Hayes to replace Anthony Davis defensively.

Concluding thoughts: it's only 5 games, but so far Jimmy has transformed the Warriors. The analytics are off the charts. Several other Western Conference teams now have some of the toughest remaining schedule strengths in the NBA. The 6th seed is a real possibility. And keep in mind that even before Jimmy showed up... The Warriors actually have a pretty good record against the best teams in the West. Does OKC or MEM or HOU or MIN want to deal with the Jimmy Butler Dubs in a Playoffs series? Could be dangerous.

Here's the Warriors record against Western Conference teams before Jimmy:
2-1 vs OKC; 2-1 vs MEM; 3-1 vs HOU; 3-1 vs MIN; 0-1 vs DEN; 0-3 vs LAL (but no AD now, different team); 0-3 vs LAC (Achilles heel?).

Any rational person would be hard-pressed to believe the Warriors are somehow going to be worse against these same teams with Jimmy Butler around. 

The Warriors really could make noise if they get the right matchup. Something special could be happening in the Bay. A ring is a long-shot, obviously, but if things break the right way, Bradley Beal deserves a statue outside of Chase Center.

The TLDR is that Jimmy's basketball IQ is off the charts.  He's easily one of the best in the game at using cuts and screens and a variety of actions off of those to create for himself and his teammates.  As I watched the video I was struck by the fact that Jimmy's offensive game is the polar opposite of Luka's.  Jimmy is a floor-runner in transition while Luka creates the break with long outlets.  Luka does his best work creating on the ball while Jimmy does his best work creating off the ball.  Jimmy is elite at screening and cutting while Luka is better off ball spacing the floor.  Isn't it interesting that we can have two so incredibly impactful players on offense and they both play in almost opposite ways-- what a game!  It got me thinking that I should show some Jimmy and Luka clips to my team to emphasize that there are many ways to be successful on offense. || A checked in, engaged Jimmy could benefit almost any team. With his playoff energy, they will be tough to beat. He is fully healthy after skating most of the year, plus time off for the suspensions.
Good pickup for the GSW || The Warriors just keep on finding ways to look terrifying. I mean, I think we all thought after Klay, they were just going to do a victory lap of mediocrity as Steph and Dray rode off into the sunset of their careers. And then this happens. I don't know if they have the firepower to play with the big boys because this team is SMALL, but that poises them well to make it deep in a Western Conference that is incredibly talented, but lacks consistent size across the conference. If they run into Denver, they are probably cooked, but if they can find a way to path through Houston, OKC, and find a way to run Edey off the floor in Memphis, there is a way for them to kinda ignore that deficiency. || Obligatory Lakers fan comment to clear up some misinformation.

You're using a 5 game sample size to draw conclusions about the Warriors. Then you use a 4 game sample that includes two games bookending the all star break to suggest the Lakers are in trouble. 

Why don't you use a 10 game sample, (starting the game after AD got injured and then later traded without playing again) where the Lakers are 7-3? That 10 game sample would show that the Lakers are 4th in defensive rating and 6th in net rating during that span. 

And that's without adding a fully healthy and conditioned Luka to the team. He's only played in 3 of those games and is clearly not himself after sitting out two months with a lower limb injury. This is Luka Doncic, the top 5 NBA player I'm referencing. 

I think the Lakers will be just fine. || The whole paragraph in the middle about the lakers was kinda weird. Good on the warriors though and especially on Jimmy. || Yeah let’s extrapolate from a 4 game sample with the all star brake in between and pretend the previous 4 months of ball didn’t happen. Warriors fans always out themselves as box score watchers. || It's pretty wild to me that people actually thought he wouldn't be an impactful addition. Sure he had injuries last year and he played pretty checked out so far this season but that was the deal. He was checked out.

He's 35 but he's in excellent shape and we've seen for years now what a motivated Jimmy giving his all can do. || With Kuminga due back from injury any day now and Moody + Podz clicking in their new roles since the trade, the Warriors really do look different.
Throw in Quinton Post as an out-of-nowhere serviceable stretch 5, and things get very interesting.

Didn't realise the strength of their schedule (or lack thereof) to close out the season was so positive for them and so bad for their top-6 spot competitors.  Let's see if this Butler transform keeps up, or if it falters due to injuries, lack of regular season fight or internal bickering (all things that can be historically attributable to Jimmy Butler and/or the Warriors in general). || In those 5 games the warriors played the Bucks without Giannis, the Rockets without Van Vleet and with Jaylen green returning form injury in limited minutes, Mavs without AD, a cratering Sacramento teams that just traded their biggest star and Chicago.

Not really a good sample is it? I’m sure if Lakers only played absolute garbage teams every week the first seed. || Jimmy can elevate to a top 5 or 3 guys in the playoffs, as can Steph.

While Steph will torch you from 3 swinging a game in a few mins Jimmy will methodically get 30 efficiently through free throws and high % plays.  

Both Steph and Jimmy are floor raisers while Draymond is one of the top glue guys.

It’s a good team with Jimmy. It’s funny watching Warriors do a 180 on Jimmy. || [removed] || [removed] || So you're saying the Lakers just locked in the 3 seed with a game to go and can rest their whole team until the playoffs now? || [removed] || [removed] || Heat fan here. The fit is completely unsurprising to me, I get the larger worry was will Jimmy actually play seriously in the regular season, and also between the bs this year, injuries last year, and his tendency to be a bit less involved in the regular season, it’s been a while since we’ve seen him playing at his highest level so it was unclear how much gas he has left in the tank. But Jimmy when he’s working hard on offense is already a complete game changer who really just needs spacing to become a huge threat. Put that with the ultimate spacer with both guys being playoff risers with experience making deep runs and it’s hard to not believe they have a chance. I do think size can become an issue for them in the playoffs, but that duo alone is pretty ridiculous and can definitely win games against just about any team in the league when things are going right || Very insightful comment. Thanks! || You think this is the only era this happened in? You can see limitless examples from games 30 years ago || >find a way to run Edey off the floor in Memphis


Literally just play 5out like warriors like to do. Edey is useless when he's not inna paint || bro said edey. || Klay was really bad in his last 2 seasons, they probably attributed 2023 as failed vibe season cuz Draymond punched Poole, but 2024 became clear they were never gonna win another chip without some changes || [removed] || Yup. Agreed.

The only team that scares me in the West is Denver because of Jokic. Houston? Nope. OKC? Will be tough but not scared. Memphis? Hell no. Not scared. Minnesota? Maybe dangerous because of size but we're 3-1 against them this season and that's before Jimmy even showed up. I think we take that series too.

All of which is to say, with the 22nd toughest remaining schedule strength and a lot of momentum with Jimmy, I think the 6th seed is possible. And I also think if they somehow avoid Denver, they can make a real Playoff run too. At least through the West. || Dallas's size poses them a problem as well || It is not use man, this guy is a Warriors fan and LeBron hater, who tries to hide it by making ""thoughtful posts on this sub"".

Even if all that was not  true using a 5 game sample size when you have played bad and injured teams is not serious.

His use of stats is comical as well, lacks any context just copy and paste some stats and act like they are the bible. || [removed] || Yes, a 5 game sample. Because that's how many games Jimmy has played with the Warriors. It's not misinformation. You just don't like the information. 

How many games have the Lakers had Luka actually playing? 4 games. Why would I go backwards to analyze before that point? Makes no sense. You have a different team now and so do the Warriors.

DunksAndThrees predictive model does not like the Lakers right now. That's not misinformation. That's a fact. If you have access you can check it yourself. Only 10 games with a win probability 55% or more. You are 2-2 in the Luka Era. Could things improve? Of course! Will they? That remains to be seen. || It's not just about the quality of the wins and losses. It is that, regardless of the reason, they lost typically winnable games and they are running out of time, with a really rough schedule ahead of them. Time is limited. It isn't just about whether the Lakers, when they fully figure it out, are good, the question is if they are good enough to make up for this stage when they are ramping up, with such a difficult schedule ahead of them. || [removed] || He/She is an obvious Lakers/ Bron hater if you check his post history.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.045,0.862,0.093,0.98,0.109,0.753,0.138,0.9952

**Paint-Defense:**

>. A lot of ink has been spilled arguing for it as the singularly most important component of an individual defender’s ability to help his team prevent the other guys from scoring. It’s also an aspect of the game that is poorly quantified, especially pre-data ball. Blocks are by and large the primary measure people use, but a look at usage (**rim-load**, measured by **PPs (Primary Protections))** reveals that even players who offer very little rim-protection can be made to [look like centerpieces if one limits their evaluation to counting how often contact is made with the ball](https://forums.realgm.com/boards/viewtopic.php?p=113791345#p113791345[/url])

Corzine and Oakley both were the primary or co-primary paint protectors on a boatload of possessions above. But is Corzine’s relativity to Oakley there the Bull’s doing, or their own? Jokic spends alot of time defending the paint, even compared to other bigs. Is he a great rim-protector? Or is he just being hunted by opposing offenses?

To answer these queries, I present the latest product of Eye-Test, Inc:

**Irrational Avoidances (IA).**

The following conditions must be met to rack up an Irrational Avoidance…

1. More of your team’s defenders are on the opposing side of the floor for a sequence (There can be multiple sequences per possession)
2. Despite this the attacker/attacking team chooses to attack the side with more defenders
3. This decision is made after a reset or in the half-court/semi-transition

Note, “the floor” here really describes the area of space a set of defenders covers, not the literal floor. Additionally the sides are determined using the vantage point of the initial ball-handler. If you can imagine a symmetric line being drawn from the ball-handler’s POV to the basket…being to the left or right of said line determines what side you’re on. I will also exclusively look at how a sequence starts.

A “sequence” ends whenever there is a pause in the ball-handlers movement or the possession finishes.

# Intro

An interesting claim popped up in the 2009 RPOY:

\[url\]https://forums.realgm.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=2433040\[/url\]

>First point I'd qualify as disagreement - I see more problems with Brons play than just one scoring matchups. LeBron was well below his normal defensive impact vs Orlando in '09. And struggled in more areas offensively than just scoring vs the Celtics (TOV issues, and as the far and away primary ballhandler, it's at least partially on him if none of the rest of the team gets going - his playmaking was more limited than Robinsons ever was - in terms of percent of impact). Injury context is an explanation for why poor play occurs, it doesn't (at least for me) change anything in evaluating that play itself.

>I 'acknowledged' that LeBron didn't have the energy (or the capability) to be a primary rim protector. Not that he couldn't/shouldn't have been better defensively, a pretty notable difference. I expected a lot more from him - for perspective, I grade it similarly to Melo's concurrent series vs the Lakers, which is, a distinct negative.

The 2009 Cleveland Cavaliers performed, statistically, like an all-time offense facing the #1 ranked defense, anchored by Dwight Howard: Officially voted DPOY and voted so unanimously by 2024 Retro POY voters. Yet Cleveland still lost thanks to the defense, which was great in the regular-season, and even better in the previous two rounds, collapsing dramatically under the weight of Dwight Howard and red-hot shooting. With Lebron’s 2009 ECF sometimes shouted as the best *anyone* has ever played on the back of what he did offensively; it seems fair to question what he offered defensively, being 2nd in DPOY voting both among official and RPOY voters, during what was still, overall, an underperformance relative to Cleveland’s regular-season.

To start answering this I’m going to bring back the Full version of the defensive tracking system we’ve used for Hakeem, Kidd, and 2007 Lebron \[as of time of this post Jordan has just been done too)

There is a great deal more grey area here than with the creation stuff I think. Vetting and perhaps some discussion on what should be counted or not counted is welcomed. If you just want to see the numbers you can control+F for “Tally and Analysis”.

Let’s begin.

# Tracking

**Possession 1 - 1:55**

Lebron spends the most time guarding an opposing ball-handler, picking up Alston from the back-court. He spends basically the rest of the possession as Cleveland’s backline big, including a few seconds where he’s parked on Dwight on an island. Think he’s at least a co-primary on the perimeter and paint here. You could argue for Varejoa on both fronts too (contests the shot, fronts Dwight, hovers around or at the paint for most of the possession though he never is really “near” the basket).

**(Lebron - 1 PP, 1 PPD)**

**Possession 2 - 2:50**

Lebron picks up Alston from half-court again. Alston throws the ball left and Lebron watches 3 of his teammates deal with the attack from the right

**Possession 3 - 12:43**

Alston drives on Lebron again and Lebron deflects his pass to another Magic player. Alstan runs to the other side and Lebron chases along the baseline before repositioning by the basket to deter any pass attempt at a rolling Dwight . The ball is then thrown to an unmarked Alstan who Lebron comes out and contests. Alston misses. This is clear cut.

**(Lebron - 2 PPD, 1 EPPD)**

**Possession 4 - 16:55**

Lebron picks up Alston again. Alston gives it to Hedo who lobs it right to Dwight for a basket. Lebron’s the primary here by default, presumably spending the most time guarding an opposing ball-handler (we miss the start of the possession). Maybe Co considering it’s probably more important to guard Hedo’s lob (Remember, usage=/ efficacy).

**(Lebron - 3 PPD)**

**Possession 5 - 17:21**

Lebron picks up Alston who swings the ball to the other side. Lebron then drops back to  potentially help on Dwight, briefly watching him 1 on 1 as Igauskas shuffles towards Hedo.

**Possession 6 - 18:00**

Lebron gets his first IA as Alston uses a Dwight screen to dribble it towards the more crowded, Lebron-less side (1). Varejao gets in the way and Lebron gets around the screen in time to bat-away a pass attempt. Varejo gets the takeaway on the inbound. Seems fair to consider Lebron a co-primary here.

**(Lebron - 4 PPD, 2 EPPD)**

**Possession 7 - 19:10**

Lebron has little involvement as the attack develops but helps secure Cleveland ball on the rebound.

**Possession 8 - 20:00**

Lebron watches from around the free-throw line as the play develops.

**Possession 9 - 20:20**

Lebron gets his 2nd IA (2) as Alston turns and swings it with Dwight setting a screen to prevent Lebron from chasing. With Lebron not in between the basket and the ball-handler on either, both avoidances so far would qualify as “weak”. Lebron is there to help when Hedo drives. Hedo passes it to familiar foe Alston who Lebron funnels into Varejao.

**Possession 10 - 21:20**

Lebron starts on Alston, issuing instructions to two teammates. When Alston passes it off Lebron relocates at the edge of the paint. He shuffles to cover a potential pass attempt to Hedo. He then goes to the freethow line offering a second body vs Dwight and then creeps towards Lewis in case Lewis burns his man (He doesn’t).

**Possession 11 - 21:50**

Lebron is the last to get back and watches from the weak side as Dwight burns Ilgauskas for a layup.

**Possession 12 - 22:25**

Lebron follows Dwight into the paint as Magic break. Varejao switches onto him as Alston fires and swishes.

**(Lebron, 2 PP)**

**Possession 13 - 26:20**

Lebron picks up Alston again and gets around a Dwight screen to stay connected giving Alston no option facing traffic but to kick it out. Alston makes a great read and his teammate converts.

**(Lebron - 5 PPD, 3 EPPD)**

**Possession 14 - 26:49**

Alston on Lebron again and again Dwight screens to get Alston some daylight. Lebron gets around the screen and Alston bounces it to Dwight who rejected by Varejoa with Ilgauskas also helping.

**(Lebron - 6 PPD)**

**Possession 15 - 27:52**

When we cut from Craig Sager Lebron is in the paint with Alston. Alston curls outside to get the ball and Lebron follows. Dwight screens Lebron again and this time it works with Lebron getting stuck and being late to contest. Alston misses.

**(Lebron - 7 PPD, 1 IPPD)**

**Possession 16 - 28:09**

Lebron starts on Alston who passes it off,  runs towards Hedo as he receives the ball open at the corner, and then helps on Dwight who gets the ball from Alston. Lebron helps Varejao force Dwight to the floor but Varejoa is called for a foul. Lebron starts facing Jaimeson on the inbound. Think he should count as a co-primary here.

**(Lebron - 8 PPD)**

**Possession 17 - 29:22**

Lebron picks up a foul trying to pressure Lewis in the backcourt. Lebron stays on Lewis as he brings the ball towards the key and then passes it off. Lebron follows him off-ball and watches Dwight lay-it-in.

**(Lebron - 9 PPD)**

**Possession 18 - 30:30**

Cavs are caught off-guard with an outlet. Lebron gets back and covers an attacker at the basket in case Lewis gets off a shot or pass. Lewis is fouled.

**Possession 19 - 31:59**

Alston brings the ball up again and Lebron picks him up. Alston lobs it to Hedo on the other side who throws it to Lewis who is blocked. PPD again, though mostly by default.

**(Lebron - 10 PPD)**

**Possession 20 - 32:30**

Anthony Johnson brings the ball up and Lebron picks him up. Johnson swings it to Hedo and Lebron retreats to the paint, deterring a potential Hedo-Dwight connection right under the basket. Dwight leaves the paint to get open and Lebron repositions towards the far-side. Lebron then exploits Dwight dealing with 2 Cavs (primarily Varejao) to reject his shot weakside. All considered I think that’s enough to be considered a co-primary even though, for the block specifically, Varejoa contributed more.

**(Lebron - 3 PP, 1 EPP)**

**Possession 21 - 34:06**

The ball is inbounded to Johnson. Lebron picks him up. Johnson throws it to Hedo. Lebron briefly covers two Orlando players before settling on Johnson when he receives the ball. Johnson swings the ball to Pietrus in the corner who drives inside. Lebron helps and Pietrus turns the ball over with an errant pass.

**(Lebron - 11 PPD, 4 EPPD)**

**Possession 22 - 34:31**

Hedo throws an outlet to Pietrus who charges towards the basket. Lebron goes for the chasedown block but comes up short.

**(Lebron - 4 PP)**

**Possession 23 - 35:12**

Lebron hangs around the top of the key.

**\]Possession 24 - 23:43**

Lebron watches from the top of the key as Marshall forces a deflection.

(Lebron goes to the bench)

(Lebron comes back at 49:56)

**Possession 25 - 51:30**

Lebron picks up Alston who throws it to Hedo. Hedo is fouled. Alston gets the ball again on the inbound and Johnson screens Lebron and rolls. Varejao switches but Lebron doesn’t follow Johson instead goes for the steal and misses. He also forces Varejao to take the long way to Johnson who takes advantage of the space to drive and kick it out to the elbow. Instead of picking up a wide-open Alston, Lebron goes after already-covered Hedo giving Alston acres to drive and dish. Orlando scores.

**(Lebron - 12 PPD, 2 IPPD)**

**Possession 26 - 56:39**

Picks up Alston as he brings the ball up. After Alston swings it Lebron slips to the basket where he waits on an island on a vacated paint-area discouraging Hedo from throwing it to Gortat. Instead Hedo throws the ball to Alston in the corner. Lebron leaves the paint to cover and Orlando capitalises throwing as Alston swings it to Lewis who drives and lays it in.

**(Lebron - 5 PP, 2 EPP, 13 PPD)**

**Possession 27 - 57:24**

First possession where Lebron is used as a full-on bigman with Lebron spending all the possession in the paint and most of it near the basket. Maybe in response to Ilgauskas being diced on the previous play? Hedo hits a jumper over Big Z.

**(Lebron - 6 PP, 13 PPD)**

**Possession 28 - 57:58**

Lebron starts the possession as a backline big waiting near the basket. Like 2 plays ago, he runs to Alston when he’s thrown the ball. This time Alston drives himself but Lebron funnels him into Ilgauskas forcing a bad pass. Ball goes out. On the inbound Varejao goes down on a pick and Lebron comes up to guard his man, funnelling him into Ilgauskas.

**(Lebron - 7 PP, 14 PPD, 5 EPPD)**

**Possession 29  - 1:04:01**

Alston brings the ball up again. Lebron picks him up again. Alston passes it off and Lebron watches the rest of the play from the free-throw line.

**Possession 30 - 1:07:59**

Alston vs Lebron starts the possession again. Lebron gives instructions to his teammates and then switches to Lewis who he then shadows on a drive before Lewis fakes a shot vs Ilgauskas and throws it to Hedo who converts the jumper.

**(Lebron - 15 PPD)**

**Possession 31 - 1:08:51**

Lebron retreats along the weak side as Lewis drives and picks up Gortat closing any potential passing window. Lewis turns it over.

**Possession 32 - 1:09:53**

Lebron watches Hedo drive on Mo-Williams for free-throws.

**Possession 33 - 1:11:17**

Lebron  spends the most time in the paint and near the basket,deterring a potential feed to a rolling Gortat. He hangs there until Lewis gets at which point Ilgauskas takes over. Lebron waits behind Varejao in case he gets beat. Lewis pulls up and converts.

**(Lebron - 8 PP)**

**Possession 34 - 1:11:48**

Lebron spends a bit of time as the Cavs sole paint-defender before moving to contest an Alston jumper. Alston misses and Lebron returns to the paint. Hedo gets the ball and clanks a jumper.

**Possession 35 - 1:12:34**

Lebron picks up Alston and hounds him, even as Gostat sets a pick. Unfortunately Ilgauskas is too slow to reach a rolling Gortat and Alston is able to get off a pass leading to an easy dunk with 1 second left in the half.

**(Lebron - 16 PPD)**

**Possession 36 - 1:34:43**

Lebron picks up Alston who tosses it to Lewis. Lebron keeps watch from the edge of the paint and then comes to the basket to meet Dwight, deterring a potential pass from Hedo. Instead Turkoglu throws it to Alston in the corner and Lebron follows. Alston throws it to Lewis and Lebron returns to watch Dwight. Lewis drives and misses but Dwight beats Lebron for the putback. A valiant effort considering the matchup but this tracking system does not curve for position.

**(Lebron 9 PP - 1 IPP)**

**Possession 37 - 1:35:20**

Orlando break. Lebron chases Hedo into traffic and Hedo passes it off. Hedo gets the ball again and Lebron locks him down, pushing him towards the side-line and poking the ball out of bounds. On the inbound Lebron picks up Alston who gives it to JJ Reddick who gets fouled. On the second inbound Lebron is stationed at the edge of the paint as a secondary paint-protector. Dwight posts-up, drives, and throws a hook over Ilgauskas that neither Lebron or Varajao are able to retrieve.

**(Lebron - 17 PPD, 6 EPPD)**

**Possession 38 - 1:36:57**

Reddick brings the ball up and is fouled. Alston gets the ball on the rebound and Lebron picks him up. Dwight sets a screen, buying Alston time to get a shot off as Lebron contests late. Alston converts.

**(Lebron - 18 PPD, 3 IPPD)**

**Possession 39 - 1:37:47**

Lebron picks up Alston who bounces the ball to Dwight. Dwight then bodies Ilgauskas for space only to be rejected by Lebron on the weakside. Very effective \[i\]secondary\[/i\] paint-protection but that is outside the scope of what’s being counted.

**(Lebron - 19 PPD)**

**Possession 40 - 1:38:42**

Lebron turns the ball over and then races back for a chase down block. He comes short.

**(Lebron - 10 PP)**

# Tally and Analysis

**Perimeter Defense - Lebron**

>\-> 18 PPDs

>\-> 3 IPPDs

During Lebron’s first 40 possessions, I gave him, **10** possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in **2** and ineffective in **1**. Lebron also was given **18** possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in **6** and ineffective in \[b\]3\[/b\]. Additionally, Lebron was given \[b\]2\[/b\] Irrational Avoidances. This means per Possession, Lebron averaged, \[b\]0.25\[/b\] PPs, \[b\]0.05\[/b\] EPPs, \[b\]0.025 IPPs\[/b\], \[b\]0.45 PPDs\[/b\], \[b\]0.15 EPPDs\[/b\], \[b\]0.075\[/b\] IPPDs, and \[b\]0.05\[/b\] IAs.

During his first 40 possessions of the 2007 Finals, I gave Lebron 5 possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in \[b\]3\[/b\] and ineffective in \[b\]1\[/b\]. Lebron also was given \[b\]16\[/b\] possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in \[b\]9\[/b\] and ineffective in \[b\]3\[/b\]. Additionally Lebron was given \[b\]9\[/b\] Irrational Avoidances. This means per Possession, Lebron averaged, \[b\]0.125\[/b\] PPs, \[b\]0.075\[/b\] EPPs, \[b\]0.025 IPPs\[/b\], \[b\]0.4 PPDs\[/b\], \[b\]0.225 EPPDs\[/b\], \[b\]0.075\[/b\] IPPDs, and \[b\]0.225\[/b\] IAs

For comparison here is how the other two players tracked with this system faired:

\[spoiler\]During Kidd’s first 40 possessions of Game 6 of the 2003 Finals, I gave him, \[b\]3\[/b\] possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in \[b\]1\[/b\] and ineffective in \[b\]1\[/b\]. Kidd was also given \[b\]10\[/b\] possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in \[b\]6\[/b\] and ineffective in \[b\]3\[/b\]. Additionally Kidd was given \[b\]2\[/b\] Irrational Avoidances. This means per Possession, Kidd averaged, \[b\]0.075\[/b\] PPs, \[b\]0.025\[/b\] EPPs, \[b\]0.025 IPPs\[/b\], \[b\]0.25 PPDs\[/b\], \[b\]0.15 EPPDs\[/b\], \[b\]0.075\[/b\] IPPDs, and \[b\]0.05\[/b\] IAs.

The only other defender all these inputs have been tracked for is 97 Hakeem. During Hakeem’s first 40 possessions of the 6th game of the 97 WCF, I gave him 27 possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in 13 and ineffective in 7. Hakeem also was given 4 possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in 3 and ineffective in 1. Additionally Hakeem was given 4 Irrational Avoidances. This means per Possession, Hakeem averaged, 0.675 PPs, 0.325 EPPs, 0.175 IPPs, 0.1 PPDs, 0.075 EPPDs, 0.025 IPPDs, and 0.1 IAs.\[/spoiler\]

Here’s how other players fared in terms of Paint-usage (only Duncan and Drob (1999 finals) had efficacy tracked)

\[spoiler\]The only other guards to have their PPs counted are Micheal Jordan, Sam Vinceint, and BJ Armstrong. Jordan tallied 3 PPs in the first 40 possessions of game 3 of the 1988 ECSF between New York and Chicago. Sam Vincient tallied 2. Jordan tallied 1 PP in the first 40 possessions of the 4th game of the 1991 ECF.  Armstrong also tallied 1.

For a comparison to wings(over the first 40 defensive possessions for their respective teams), Oakley, Pippen, and Grant tallied 13, 8, and 6 PPs respectively in the aforementioned 88 game. In the aforementioned 91 game, Pippen and Grant had 14 PPs each. In the final game of the 94 ECSF between New York and Chicago, Oakley and Pippen tallied 15 PPs and Grant tallied 7. In the 86 Finals, Reid tallied 5.

During the Spurs’ first 40 defensive possessions, I gave Duncan, \[b\]21\[/b\] possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in \[b\]6\[/b\] and ineffective in \[b\]4\[/b\]. Robinson was given \[b\]16 PPs\[/b\] as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in \[b\]8\[/b\] and ineffective in \[b\]6\[/b\]. Both had an irrational avoidance. When they shared the court Duncan and Robinson had 17 PPs each with Duncan being deemed effective in 4 and Robinson being deemed effective in 8. Both were deemed ineffective in 4. Robinson additionally had 1 IA

For Bigs, Over 37 possessions Duncan averaged \[b\].57 PPs\[/b\], \[b\]0.16 EPPs\[/b\], \[b\]0.11 IPPs\[/b\], and \[b\]0.03 IAs\[/b\].

Over 31 possessions Robinson averaged \[b\]0.58\[/b\] PPs, \[b\]0.26 EPPs\[/b\], \[b\]0.13 IPPs\[/b\]. \[b\]0.032 IAs.\[/b\]

Over 22 Possessions in the final game of the 94 ECSF vs Chicago, Ewing had 13 PPs and 3 IAs giving him, per possession, \[b\].59 PPs\[/b\] and \[b\]1.4 IAs\[/b\].\[/spoiler\]

While it’s possible this stretch of basketball is just an outlier, without a dramatic dip in performance in the other 11 halves of basketball uncovered, Lebron playing “distinctively negative” defense seems like a tough sell, with the implication Lebron was a low-usage defender not aligning with what is \[i\]currently\[/i\] on tape. Lebron looks like his team’s most relied-upon perimeter defender while simultaneously being one of their most relied upon paint-protectors: a safe top 3 and depending on interpretations maybe top 2. With what was physically observed and counted it looks like a much better showing in terms of both efficacy and usage than what I tracked for one Jason Kidd: inside and out. Kidd does have a reputation as having intangible impact as a defensive floor-general, but that is currently outside of the scope of these trackings.

A comparison with the 2007 outing isn’t as clear cut with Lebron grading out higher in paint and perimeter usage in 2009 but having more of those plays deemed “effective” in 2007. San Antonio also far more blatantly making a point of avoiding him (A record breaking 9 IAs vs 2). That said, I think I’d have to favor 2007 as more “productive” with Lebron having a much more difficult primary assignment, being a much bigger focus of San Antonio’s offense, and having a lower-ratio of “co-primary” to outright primary plays. Lebron’s 2 IAs here were both “weak”, while there were IAs for Lebron which were accrued during plays the Spurs reset their offense multiple times to avoid Parker vs Lebron. While I think the numbers correctly reflect that Lebron was used alot more as a paint-protector, it’s worth noting he didn’t outright stop anyone at the paint strong-side. In the 40 possessions tracked for 2007 Lebron, that occurred twice. I think 2009 Lebron is also a bigger benefactor of “shorter” or “ensemble” possessions where what is required to be considered a primary or co-primary is lower. That said, there are points in favor of the 2009 tape. For one, Lebron’s “ineffective” plays are less severe/excusable. There is no equivalent of the IPP Lebron racked in 2007 by just not bothering to jump to stop someone smaller on a fast break. The sole IPP Lebron racked up for the 2009 tracking would probably be an extremely high-value possession facing almost any other matchup. There were also two near-home runs for 2009 Lebron in his two failed chasedown blocks.

Moreover, despite me thinking 2007 Lebron was more “productive” defensively over the 40 possessions tracked, if I only had these 80 defensive possessions to go off, I would probably favor 2009 Lebron for a series. While I think 2007 Lebron did more facing the Spurs, I would expect 2009 Lebron to be capable of replicating what 2007 Lebron did to the Spurs guards on the perimeter while offering more in the paint and being less error-prone.

The 97 Hakeem comparison is largely philosophical with Hakeem clearly outdoing Lebron inside and the reverse being true outside, Hakeem did rack up more total primaries (PPs+PPDs).

As a paint-protector Lebron looks pretty good relative to other tracked wings. He’s not too far off the current record for PPs (15). Wonder if he would get closer to or hit those marks if we looked at teams more starved for paint-protection. I might look at Lebron’s usage on the 2016 Cavs or 2013 Heat down the line.

On deck is Jordan: Expanding the sample for assessing him as a rim-protector and looking at what he offers outside. I’m especially curious how many IAs he racks up. By reputation opposing offenses made a point of avoiding direct confrontation similar to what we saw 2007 Lebron. This system also has yet to be applied to a high-stock guard. I’m particularly curious how he looks in comparison to Kidd.

# Miscellaneous

Differentiated between “weak”’ and “strong” IAs as promised though I’d want to see more examples of them being a high-volume phenomena (like with 2007 Lebron) before I commit to listing the two separately

If I do start making it an “official” thing here is what distinguishes strong and weak:

\[spoiler\]As a final note, I think I’m going to make some tweaks to my tracking system starting with IAs:

1. Differentiate between “strong” and “weak” IAs. A strong IA must either have the opposite side have 4 defenders, or the player getting the IA must be directly between the ball-handler and the basket \[i\]and\[/i\]  closer to the top of the key than the sideline.\[/spoiler\]

Will probably want to give this a test-run at some point

>2. Input a defensive counterpart for DTOS (defenders taken out) called DKI (defenders kept in) to function as an inclusive measure of help and team defense. I’ll save the details of that for another thread.

>I’m feeling like doing Wade or Kawhi after I finish my Duncan tracking. Kawhi in particular might be an interesting test-run for revamped IA tracking. Wade is considered the greatest shot-blocking guard by many so it would be interesting to see if that manifests in unusually high paint-usage.",81,18,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ix88hg/2009_lebron_conference_finals_defensive_tracking/,2025-02-24 12:54:05,"I know ill get downvoted, but 2009 was an outlier.

tfw when you only look at scoring to assess basketball players. Lebron was good in 2008 and fine in 2007. He was dissapointing in 2010 relative to himself after injuring his elbow but 2011 is the only year he was actually bad in the series he lost having bulked up 20 pounds for a post-game he didn't yet have.

If you found 2010 series disappointing, the 2007 & 2008 series were certainly worse than that. He shot 35% overall in both of them and had several of his worse games in his career in each of those series. 

Personally, I think 2007 was actually his worst finals in his career but Game 4 of 2011 was  his worse game. || Perception of Lebron, whether strong or hateful, always seems to supersede his actual play || I’m willing to grant him grace since it was game 1 and that Celtics defense was historically great. Pierce went 2-14 in that game. Ray Allen had 0 points. That series in general was just a slugfest || i know what you're referring to, and as you just admitted, the only thing you're looking at is scoring.

In 2008 he was unarguably Cleveland's best defender, had an all-time playmaking series, and outscored the Celtics with help that was literally **winless** when he didn't play.

Trying to argue 2011 was better than those series is pure box-watching. 2011 Lebron didn't have the most gravity if any perimiter player ever, and wasn't having all of the mavs defenders form prisms around him., and he wasn't having dallas reset 3 times in a possession trying to get their star guards away from him.

But hey, I guess if we ignore defense and playmaking for an all-time wing defender and playmaker, then yeah, **2009** was the outlier, not 2011, lol

Lebron's playmaking was fantastic that series, creating much more than 10 assist performances from ""good"" playmakers despite not being given anywhere near the same oppurtunity. That and Lebron's defense were major reasons those games were close despite the cavs being way less talented and way more injured.

>And scoring is pretty darn important, too.

You say while criticising a series where the otherwise winless cleveland cavaliers that went 0-6 without Lebron in 08 and 1-15 without Lebron from 08-10 and were at a 15-win pace before blowing everything up in 2011...outscored the 66-win eventual champions on the back of a Lebron-anchored defense.

Lmao

2011 is the one time Lebron had a stacked team and lost anyway and it's because Lebron played trash. Him having a better slashline than 2007 doesn't matter.

Corzine and Oakley both were the primary or co-primary paint protectors on a boatload of possessions above. But is Corzine’s relativity to Oakley there the Bull’s doing, or their own? Jokic spends alot of time defending the paint, even compared to other bigs. Is he a great rim-protector? Or is he just being hunted by opposing offenses?

To answer these queries, I present the latest product of Eye-Test, Inc:

**Irrational Avoidances (IA).**

The following conditions must be met to rack up an Irrational Avoidance…

1. More of your team’s defenders are on the opposing side of the floor for a sequence (There can be multiple sequences per possession)
2. Despite this the attacker/attacking team chooses to attack the side with more defenders
3. This decision is made after a reset or in the half-court/semi-transition

Note, “the floor” here really describes the area of space a set of defenders covers, not the literal floor. Additionally the sides are determined using the vantage point of the initial ball-handler. If you can imagine a symmetric line being drawn from the ball-handler’s POV to the basket…being to the left or right of said line determines what side you’re on. I will also exclusively look at how a sequence starts.

A “sequence” ends whenever there is a pause in the ball-handlers movement or the possession finishes.

And struggled in more areas offensively than just scoring vs the Celtics (TOV issues, and as the far and away primary ballhandler, it's at least partially on him if none of the rest of the team gets going - his playmaking was more limited than Robinsons ever was - in terms of percent of impact).

The 2009 Cleveland Cavaliers performed, statistically, like an all-time offense facing the #1 ranked defense, anchored by Dwight Howard: Officially voted DPOY and voted so unanimously by 2024 Retro POY voters. Yet Cleveland still lost thanks to the defense, which was great in the regular-season, and even better in the previous two rounds, collapsing dramatically under the weight of Dwight Howard and red-hot shooting. With Lebron’s 2009 ECF sometimes shouted as the best *anyone* has ever played on the back of what he did offensively; it seems fair to question what he offered defensively, being 2nd in DPOY voting both among official and RPOY voters, during what was still, overall, an underperformance relative to Cleveland’s regular-season.

To start answering this I’m going to bring back the Full version of the defensive tracking system we’ve used for Hakeem, Kidd, and 2007 Lebron \[as of time of this post Jordan has just been done too)

There is a great deal more grey area here than with the creation stuff I think. Vetting and perhaps some discussion on what should be counted or not counted is welcomed. If you just want to see the numbers you can control+F for “Tally and Analysis”.

Let’s begin.

# Tracking

**Possession 1 - 1:55**

Lebron spends the most time guarding an opposing ball-handler, picking up Alston from the back-court. He spends basically the rest of the possession as Cleveland’s backline big, including a few seconds where he’s parked on Dwight on an island. Think he’s at least a co-primary on the perimeter and paint here. You could argue for Varejoa on both fronts too (contests the shot, fronts Dwight, hovers around or at the paint for most of the possession though he never is really “near” the basket).

**(Lebron - 1 PP, 1 PPD)**

**Possession 2 - 2:50**

Lebron picks up Alston from half-court again. Alston throws the ball left and Lebron watches 3 of his teammates deal with the attack from the right

**Possession 3 - 12:43**

Alston drives on Lebron again and Lebron deflects his pass to another Magic player. Alstan runs to the other side and Lebron chases along the baseline before repositioning by the basket to deter any pass attempt at a rolling Dwight . The ball is then thrown to an unmarked Alstan who Lebron comes out and contests. Alston misses. This is clear cut.

**(Lebron - 2 PPD, 1 EPPD)**

**Possession 4 - 16:55**

Lebron picks up Alston again. Alston gives it to Hedo who lobs it right to Dwight for a basket. Lebron’s the primary here by default, presumably spending the most time guarding an opposing ball-handler (we miss the start of the possession). Maybe Co considering it’s probably more important to guard Hedo’s lob (Remember, usage=/ efficacy).

**(Lebron - 3 PPD)**

**Possession 5 - 17:21**

Lebron picks up Alston who swings the ball to the other side. Lebron then drops back to  potentially help on Dwight, briefly watching him 1 on 1 as Igauskas shuffles towards Hedo.

**Possession 6 - 18:00**

Lebron gets his first IA as Alston uses a Dwight screen to dribble it towards the more crowded, Lebron-less side (1). Varejao gets in the way and Lebron gets around the screen in time to bat-away a pass attempt. Varejo gets the takeaway on the inbound. Seems fair to consider Lebron a co-primary here.

**(Lebron - 4 PPD, 2 EPPD)**

**Possession 7 - 19:10**

Lebron has little involvement as the attack develops but helps secure Cleveland ball on the rebound.

**Possession 8 - 20:00**

Lebron watches from around the free-throw line as the play develops.

**Possession 9 - 20:20**

Lebron gets his 2nd IA (2) as Alston turns and swings it with Dwight setting a screen to prevent Lebron from chasing. With Lebron not in between the basket and the ball-handler on either, both avoidances so far would qualify as “weak”. Lebron is there to help when Hedo drives. Hedo passes it to familiar foe Alston who Lebron funnels into Varejao.

**Possession 10 - 21:20**

Lebron starts on Alston, issuing instructions to two teammates. When Alston passes it off Lebron relocates at the edge of the paint. He shuffles to cover a potential pass attempt to Hedo. He then goes to the freethow line offering a second body vs Dwight and then creeps towards Lewis in case Lewis burns his man (He doesn’t).

**Possession 11 - 21:50**

Lebron is the last to get back and watches from the weak side as Dwight burns Ilgauskas for a layup.

**Possession 12 - 22:25**

Lebron follows Dwight into the paint as Magic break. Varejao switches onto him as Alston fires and swishes.

**(Lebron, 2 PP)**

**Possession 13 - 26:20**

Lebron picks up Alston again and gets around a Dwight screen to stay connected giving Alston no option facing traffic but to kick it out. Alston makes a great read and his teammate converts.

**(Lebron - 5 PPD, 3 EPPD)**

**Possession 14 - 26:49**

Alston on Lebron again and again Dwight screens to get Alston some daylight. Lebron gets around the screen and Alston bounces it to Dwight who rejected by Varejoa with Ilgauskas also helping.

**(Lebron - 6 PPD)**

**Possession 15 - 27:52**

When we cut from Craig Sager Lebron is in the paint with Alston. Alston curls outside to get the ball and Lebron follows. Dwight screens Lebron again and this time it works with Lebron getting stuck and being late to contest. Alston misses.

**(Lebron - 7 PPD, 1 IPPD)**

**Possession 16 - 28:09**

Lebron starts on Alston who passes it off,  runs towards Hedo as he receives the ball open at the corner, and then helps on Dwight who gets the ball from Alston. Lebron helps Varejao force Dwight to the floor but Varejoa is called for a foul. Lebron starts facing Jaimeson on the inbound. Think he should count as a co-primary here.

**(Lebron - 8 PPD)**

**Possession 17 - 29:22**

Lebron picks up a foul trying to pressure Lewis in the backcourt. Lebron stays on Lewis as he brings the ball towards the key and then passes it off. Lebron follows him off-ball and watches Dwight lay-it-in.

**(Lebron - 9 PPD)**

**Possession 18 - 30:30**

Cavs are caught off-guard with an outlet. Lebron gets back and covers an attacker at the basket in case Lewis gets off a shot or pass. Lewis is fouled.

**Possession 19 - 31:59**

Alston brings the ball up again and Lebron picks him up. Alston lobs it to Hedo on the other side who throws it to Lewis who is blocked. PPD again, though mostly by default.

**(Lebron - 10 PPD)**

**Possession 20 - 32:30**

Anthony Johnson brings the ball up and Lebron picks him up. Johnson swings it to Hedo and Lebron retreats to the paint, deterring a potential Hedo-Dwight connection right under the basket. Dwight leaves the paint to get open and Lebron repositions towards the far-side. Lebron then exploits Dwight dealing with 2 Cavs (primarily Varejao) to reject his shot weakside. All considered I think that’s enough to be considered a co-primary even though, for the block specifically, Varejoa contributed more.

**(Lebron - 3 PP, 1 EPP)**

**Possession 21 - 34:06**

The ball is inbounded to Johnson. Lebron picks him up. Johnson throws it to Hedo. Lebron briefly covers two Orlando players before settling on Johnson when he receives the ball. Johnson swings the ball to Pietrus in the corner who drives inside. Lebron helps and Pietrus turns the ball over with an errant pass.

**(Lebron - 11 PPD, 4 EPPD)**

**Possession 22 - 34:31**

Hedo throws an outlet to Pietrus who charges towards the basket. Lebron goes for the chasedown block but comes up short.

**(Lebron - 4 PP)**

**Possession 23 - 35:12**

Lebron hangs around the top of the key.

**\]Possession 24 - 23:43**

Lebron watches from the top of the key as Marshall forces a deflection.

(Lebron goes to the bench)

(Lebron comes back at 49:56)

**Possession 25 - 51:30**

Lebron picks up Alston who throws it to Hedo. Hedo is fouled. Alston gets the ball again on the inbound and Johnson screens Lebron and rolls. Varejao switches but Lebron doesn’t follow Johson instead goes for the steal and misses. He also forces Varejao to take the long way to Johnson who takes advantage of the space to drive and kick it out to the elbow. Instead of picking up a wide-open Alston, Lebron goes after already-covered Hedo giving Alston acres to drive and dish. Orlando scores.

**(Lebron - 12 PPD, 2 IPPD)**

**Possession 26 - 56:39**

Picks up Alston as he brings the ball up. After Alston swings it Lebron slips to the basket where he waits on an island on a vacated paint-area discouraging Hedo from throwing it to Gortat. Instead Hedo throws the ball to Alston in the corner. Lebron leaves the paint to cover and Orlando capitalises throwing as Alston swings it to Lewis who drives and lays it in.

**(Lebron - 5 PP, 2 EPP, 13 PPD)**

**Possession 27 - 57:24**

First possession where Lebron is used as a full-on bigman with Lebron spending all the possession in the paint and most of it near the basket. Maybe in response to Ilgauskas being diced on the previous play? Hedo hits a jumper over Big Z.

**(Lebron - 6 PP, 13 PPD)**

**Possession 28 - 57:58**

Lebron starts the possession as a backline big waiting near the basket. Like 2 plays ago, he runs to Alston when he’s thrown the ball. This time Alston drives himself but Lebron funnels him into Ilgauskas forcing a bad pass. Ball goes out. On the inbound Varejao goes down on a pick and Lebron comes up to guard his man, funnelling him into Ilgauskas.

**(Lebron - 7 PP, 14 PPD, 5 EPPD)**

**Possession 29  - 1:04:01**

Alston brings the ball up again. Lebron picks him up again. Alston passes it off and Lebron watches the rest of the play from the free-throw line.

**Possession 30 - 1:07:59**

Alston vs Lebron starts the possession again. Lebron gives instructions to his teammates and then switches to Lewis who he then shadows on a drive before Lewis fakes a shot vs Ilgauskas and throws it to Hedo who converts the jumper.

**(Lebron - 15 PPD)**

**Possession 31 - 1:08:51**

Lebron retreats along the weak side as Lewis drives and picks up Gortat closing any potential passing window. Lewis turns it over.

**Possession 32 - 1:09:53**

Lebron watches Hedo drive on Mo-Williams for free-throws.

**Possession 33 - 1:11:17**

Lebron  spends the most time in the paint and near the basket,deterring a potential feed to a rolling Gortat. He hangs there until Lewis gets at which point Ilgauskas takes over. Lebron waits behind Varejao in case he gets beat. Lewis pulls up and converts.

**(Lebron - 8 PP)**

**Possession 34 - 1:11:48**

Lebron spends a bit of time as the Cavs sole paint-defender before moving to contest an Alston jumper. Alston misses and Lebron returns to the paint. Hedo gets the ball and clanks a jumper.

**Possession 35 - 1:12:34**

Lebron picks up Alston and hounds him, even as Gostat sets a pick. Unfortunately Ilgauskas is too slow to reach a rolling Gortat and Alston is able to get off a pass leading to an easy dunk with 1 second left in the half.

**(Lebron - 16 PPD)**

**Possession 36 - 1:34:43**

Lebron picks up Alston who tosses it to Lewis. Lebron keeps watch from the edge of the paint and then comes to the basket to meet Dwight, deterring a potential pass from Hedo. Instead Turkoglu throws it to Alston in the corner and Lebron follows. Alston throws it to Lewis and Lebron returns to watch Dwight. Lewis drives and misses but Dwight beats Lebron for the putback. A valiant effort considering the matchup but this tracking system does not curve for position.

**(Lebron 9 PP - 1 IPP)**

**Possession 37 - 1:35:20**

Orlando break. Lebron chases Hedo into traffic and Hedo passes it off. Hedo gets the ball again and Lebron locks him down, pushing him towards the side-line and poking the ball out of bounds. On the inbound Lebron picks up Alston who gives it to JJ Reddick who gets fouled. On the second inbound Lebron is stationed at the edge of the paint as a secondary paint-protector. Dwight posts-up, drives, and throws a hook over Ilgauskas that neither Lebron or Varajao are able to retrieve.

**(Lebron - 17 PPD, 6 EPPD)**

**Possession 38 - 1:36:57**

Reddick brings the ball up and is fouled. Alston gets the ball on the rebound and Lebron picks him up. Dwight sets a screen, buying Alston time to get a shot off as Lebron contests late. Alston converts.

**(Lebron - 18 PPD, 3 IPPD)**

**Possession 39 - 1:37:47**

Lebron picks up Alston who bounces the ball to Dwight. Dwight then bodies Ilgauskas for space only to be rejected by Lebron on the weakside. Very effective \[i\]secondary\[/i\] paint-protection but that is outside the scope of what’s being counted.

**(Lebron - 19 PPD)**

**Possession 40 - 1:38:42**

Lebron turns the ball over and then races back for a chase down block. He comes short.

**(Lebron - 10 PP)**

# Tally and Analysis

During Lebron’s first 40 possessions, I gave him, **10** possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in **2** and ineffective in **1**. Lebron also was given **18** possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in **6** and ineffective in \[b\]3\[/b\]. Additionally, Lebron was given \[b\]2\[/b\] Irrational Avoidances. This means per Possession, Lebron averaged, \[b\]0.25\[/b\] PPs, \[b\]0.05\[/b\] EPPs, \[b\]0.025 IPPs\[/b\], \[b\]0.45 PPDs\[/b\], \[b\]0.15 EPPDs\[/b\], \[b\]0.075\[/b\] IPPDs, and \[b\]0.05\[/b\] IAs.

During his first 40 possessions of the 2007 Finals, I gave Lebron 5 possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in \[b\]3\[/b\] and ineffective in \[b\]1\[/b\]. Lebron also was given \[b\]16\[/b\] possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in \[b\]9\[/b\] and ineffective in \[b\]3\[/b\]. Additionally Lebron was given \[b\]9\[/b\] Irrational Avoidances. This means per Possession, Lebron averaged, \[b\]0.125\[/b\] PPs, \[b\]0.075\[/b\] EPPs, \[b\]0.025 IPPs\[/b\], \[b\]0.4 PPDs\[/b\], \[b\]0.225 EPPDs\[/b\], \[b\]0.075\[/b\] IPPDs, and \[b\]0.225\[/b\] IAs

For comparison here is how the other two players tracked with this system faired:

\[spoiler\]During Kidd’s first 40 possessions of Game 6 of the 2003 Finals, I gave him, \[b\]3\[/b\] possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in \[b\]1\[/b\] and ineffective in \[b\]1\[/b\]. Kidd was also given \[b\]10\[/b\] possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in \[b\]6\[/b\] and ineffective in \[b\]3\[/b\]. Additionally Kidd was given \[b\]2\[/b\] Irrational Avoidances. This means per Possession, Kidd averaged, \[b\]0.075\[/b\] PPs, \[b\]0.025\[/b\] EPPs, \[b\]0.025 IPPs\[/b\], \[b\]0.25 PPDs\[/b\], \[b\]0.15 EPPDs\[/b\], \[b\]0.075\[/b\] IPPDs, and \[b\]0.05\[/b\] IAs.

The only other defender all these inputs have been tracked for is 97 Hakeem. During Hakeem’s first 40 possessions of the 6th game of the 97 WCF, I gave him 27 possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in 13 and ineffective in 7. Hakeem also was given 4 possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in 3 and ineffective in 1. Additionally Hakeem was given 4 Irrational Avoidances. This means per Possession, Hakeem averaged, 0.675 PPs, 0.325 EPPs, 0.175 IPPs, 0.1 PPDs, 0.075 EPPDs, 0.025 IPPDs, and 0.1 IAs.\[/spoiler\]

Here’s how other players fared in terms of Paint-usage (only Duncan and Drob (1999 finals) had efficacy tracked)

\[spoiler\]The only other guards to have their PPs counted are Micheal Jordan, Sam Vinceint, and BJ Armstrong. Jordan tallied 3 PPs in the first 40 possessions of game 3 of the 1988 ECSF between New York and Chicago. Sam Vincient tallied 2. Jordan tallied 1 PP in the first 40 possessions of the 4th game of the 1991 ECF.  Armstrong also tallied 1.

For a comparison to wings(over the first 40 defensive possessions for their respective teams), Oakley, Pippen, and Grant tallied 13, 8, and 6 PPs respectively in the aforementioned 88 game. In the aforementioned 91 game, Pippen and Grant had 14 PPs each. In the final game of the 94 ECSF between New York and Chicago, Oakley and Pippen tallied 15 PPs and Grant tallied 7. In the 86 Finals, Reid tallied 5.

During the Spurs’ first 40 defensive possessions, I gave Duncan, \[b\]21\[/b\] possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in \[b\]6\[/b\] and ineffective in \[b\]4\[/b\]. Robinson was given \[b\]16 PPs\[/b\] as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in \[b\]8\[/b\] and ineffective in \[b\]6\[/b\]. Both had an irrational avoidance. When they shared the court Duncan and Robinson had 17 PPs each with Duncan being deemed effective in 4 and Robinson being deemed effective in 8. Both were deemed ineffective in 4. Robinson additionally had 1 IA

For Bigs, Over 37 possessions Duncan averaged \[b\].57 PPs\[/b\], \[b\]0.16 EPPs\[/b\], \[b\]0.11 IPPs\[/b\], and \[b\]0.03 IAs\[/b\].

Over 31 possessions Robinson averaged \[b\]0.58\[/b\] PPs, \[b\]0.26 EPPs\[/b\], \[b\]0.13 IPPs\[/b\]. \[b\]0.032 IAs.\[/b\]

Over 22 Possessions in the final game of the 94 ECSF vs Chicago, Ewing had 13 PPs and 3 IAs giving him, per possession, \[b\].59 PPs\[/b\] and \[b\]1.4 IAs\[/b\].\[/spoiler\]

While it’s possible this stretch of basketball is just an outlier, without a dramatic dip in performance in the other 11 halves of basketball uncovered, Lebron playing “distinctively negative” defense seems like a tough sell, with the implication Lebron was a low-usage defender not aligning with what is \[i\]currently\[/i\] on tape. Lebron looks like his team’s most relied-upon perimeter defender while simultaneously being one of their most relied upon paint-protectors: a safe top 3 and depending on interpretations maybe top 2. With what was physically observed and counted it looks like a much better showing in terms of both efficacy and usage than what I tracked for one Jason Kidd: inside and out. Kidd does have a reputation as having intangible impact as a defensive floor-general, but that is currently outside of the scope of these trackings.

A comparison with the 2007 outing isn’t as clear cut with Lebron grading out higher in paint and perimeter usage in 2009 but having more of those plays deemed “effective” in 2007. San Antonio also far more blatantly making a point of avoiding him (A record breaking 9 IAs vs 2). That said, I think I’d have to favor 2007 as more “productive” with Lebron having a much more difficult primary assignment, being a much bigger focus of San Antonio’s offense, and having a lower-ratio of “co-primary” to outright primary plays. Lebron’s 2 IAs here were both “weak”, while there were IAs for Lebron which were accrued during plays the Spurs reset their offense multiple times to avoid Parker vs Lebron. While I think the numbers correctly reflect that Lebron was used alot more as a paint-protector, it’s worth noting he didn’t outright stop anyone at the paint strong-side. In the 40 possessions tracked for 2007 Lebron, that occurred twice. I think 2009 Lebron is also a bigger benefactor of “shorter” or “ensemble” possessions where what is required to be considered a primary or co-primary is lower. That said, there are points in favor of the 2009 tape. For one, Lebron’s “ineffective” plays are less severe/excusable. There is no equivalent of the IPP Lebron racked in 2007 by just not bothering to jump to stop someone smaller on a fast break. The sole IPP Lebron racked up for the 2009 tracking would probably be an extremely high-value possession facing almost any other matchup. There were also two near-home runs for 2009 Lebron in his two failed chasedown blocks.

Moreover, despite me thinking 2007 Lebron was more “productive” defensively over the 40 possessions tracked, if I only had these 80 defensive possessions to go off, I would probably favor 2009 Lebron for a series. While I think 2007 Lebron did more facing the Spurs, I would expect 2009 Lebron to be capable of replicating what 2007 Lebron did to the Spurs guards on the perimeter while offering more in the paint and being less error-prone.

The 97 Hakeem comparison is largely philosophical with Hakeem clearly outdoing Lebron inside and the reverse being true outside, Hakeem did rack up more total primaries (PPs+PPDs).

As a paint-protector Lebron looks pretty good relative to other tracked wings. He’s not too far off the current record for PPs (15). Wonder if he would get closer to or hit those marks if we looked at teams more starved for paint-protection. I might look at Lebron’s usage on the 2016 Cavs or 2013 Heat down the line.

On deck is Jordan: Expanding the sample for assessing him as a rim-protector and looking at what he offers outside. I’m especially curious how many IAs he racks up. By reputation opposing offenses made a point of avoiding direct confrontation similar to what we saw 2007 Lebron. This system also has yet to be applied to a high-stock guard. I’m particularly curious how he looks in comparison to Kidd.

# Miscellaneous

Differentiated between “weak”’ and “strong” IAs as promised though I’d want to see more examples of them being a high-volume phenomena (like with 2007 Lebron) before I commit to listing the two separately

If I do start making it an “official” thing here is what distinguishes strong and weak:

\[spoiler\]As a final note, I think I’m going to make some tweaks to my tracking system starting with IAs:

1. Differentiate between “strong” and “weak” IAs. A strong IA must either have the opposite side have 4 defenders, or the player getting the IA must be directly between the ball-handler and the basket \[i\]and\[/i\]  closer to the top of the key than the sideline.\[/spoiler\]

Will probably want to give this a test-run at some point

>2. Input a defensive counterpart for DTOS (defenders taken out) called DKI (defenders kept in) to function as an inclusive measure of help and team defense. I’ll save the details of that for another thread.

>I’m feeling like doing Wade or Kawhi after I finish my Duncan tracking. Kawhi in particular might be an interesting test-run for revamped IA tracking. Wade is considered the greatest shot-blocking guard by many so it would be interesting to see if that manifests in unusually high paint-usage.",79,18,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ix88hg/2009_lebron_conference_finals_defensive_tracking/,2025-02-24 12:54:05,"I know ill get downvoted, but 2009 was an outlier.

tfw when you only look at scoring to assess basketball players. Lebron was good in 2008 and fine in 2007. He was dissapointing in 2010 relative to himself after injuring his elbow but 2011 is the only year he was actually bad in the series he lost having bulked up 20 pounds for a post-game he didn't yet have.

  
ofc we know what the actual reason y'all try and dismiss seasons as ""outliers"" for is.... || He also was far and way cleveland's best defender in 2008 on an excellent playoff defense he gets no credit for for some reason || He was great in game 7 but in first 6 games he was average at best for Lebron standarts and game 1 vs Boston is probably his worst playoff of his entire career and should be in conversition for worst playoff game by superstar 12 PTS 2-18 FG 0-6 3P 10 TOV + missing game tying shot with 5 seconds to go || I am referring specifically to the series that lebron lost in those years. If you found 2010 series disappointing, the 2007 & 2008 series were certainly worse than that. He shot 35% overall in both of them and had several of his worse games in his career in each of those series. 

Personally, I think 2007 was actually his worst finals in his career but Game 4 of 2011 was  his worse game. || Perception of Lebron, whether strong or hateful, always seems to supersede his actual play || I’m willing to grant him grace since it was game 1 and that Celtics defense was historically great.

In 2008 he was unarguably Cleveland's best defender, had an all-time playmaking series, and outscored the Celtics with help that was literally **winless** when he didn't play.

Trying to argue 2011 was better than those series is pure box-watching. 2011 Lebron didn't have the most gravity if any perimiter player ever, and wasn't having all of the mavs defenders form prisms around him., and he wasn't having dallas reset 3 times in a possession trying to get their star guards away from him.

But hey, I guess if we ignore defense and playmaking for an all-time wing defender and playmaker, then yeah, **2009** was the outlier, not 2011, lol

Never mind he was shooting better in 2010 until he injured his shooting elbow || Ray had an absolute shocker of a series || 2007  finals he had 27 Assists to 23 Turnovers. That is NOT good. And scoring is pretty darn important, too. In 2008 he Games 1-4 were one of his worse stretches in his postseason career as well.

Lebron's playmaking was fantastic that series, creating much more than 10 assist performances from ""good"" playmakers despite not being given anywhere near the same oppurtunity. That and Lebron's defense were major reasons those games were close despite the cavs being way less talented and way more injured.

You say while criticising a series where the otherwise winless cleveland cavaliers that went 0-6 without Lebron in 08 and 1-15 without Lebron from 08-10 and were at a 15-win pace before blowing everything up in 2011...outscored the 66-win eventual champions on the back of a Lebron-anchored defense.

Lmao

2011 is the one time Lebron had a stacked team and lost anyway and it's because Lebron played trash. Him having a better slashline than 2007 doesn't matter.  His playmaking was mid and his defense was at best okay. If you replaced 2011 Lebron's perfomrnace with 2007 Lebron's Miami wins. || Tim Duncan said it best in 2007:

Thanks to LeBron's evolution from his heliocentric role into a 0.5 battering ram.,"The morning I filled in for Adam Mares on the All-NBA podcast with Tim Legler, I watched Los Angeles lose to Charlotte. As I took notes and pulled clips, I could only feel disbelief at how clunky the Los Angeles offense looked with two players trying to play the same role: heliocentric alpha.

LeBron James and Luka Doncic have thrived in this role throughout their NBA careers. They’re the basketball version of grandmasters chess players. They’ve seen every coverage under the sun, can make every shot/read in the book, and they both know how to move the pieces around the basketball chessboard with precision and ease.

Thanks for reading Low Man Help! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.

But like [Highlander, there can be only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcLjcSloXs), and as to the question of who would be that *one* for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

Players often say they want to win, but they really mean, “I want to win, but I want to do it playing my way.”

The Charlotte game felt like a line of demarcation for this team. Two heliocentric grandmaster chess players wouldn’t give them the best chance to win, so an evolution had to happen.

**Two BIG things have stood out to me since that Charlotte game:**

1. LeBron’s shift into a 0.5 Player
2. The Roberson Rule

**LeBron’s Final Act:**

LeBron James has shifted from the only role he’s ever known in the NBA into a 0.5 player[1](#footnote-1). This is a massive step for someone of his caliber; he’s undoubtedly one of the top players to play this game.

Since the clunky Charlotte game, Los Angeles has won four games in a row, three of which have featured both James and Doncic. In those three victories, James recorded his two lowest games of the season in average touch length and average dribbles per touch.

During the Los Angeles win over Denver, James set a season low for average touch length (2.892 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.83).

The Denver game was the only time during the 24/25 that he had been under three seconds per touch or two dribbles. Until the Los Angeles win over Minnesota, James again set a season low for average touch length (2.581 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.44).

The data indicates precisely what the eye test says: LeBron has shifted into the 0.5 player this team needed to reach its ceiling, and he and the Los Angeles Lakers are thriving!

**LeBron James Closeouts:**

* Before Luka: 1.033 Points Per Chance (52nd Percentile)
* After Luka: 1.351 Points Per Chance (87th Percentile)

One of the most significant benefits of James relinquishing the highlander role to Doncic has been seeing his first three steps transition from then defensive end to offense. James no longer waits for every outlet pass to control the chess board; he knows Doncic sees the same picture he does, so he gets on his horse and goes!

James has long been one of the league's best, if not its best athlete. However, creating offense in the NBA takes energy, and that burden fell on James more times than not. But with Doncic in Los Angeles, the on-ball burden is gone, and LeBron’s athleticism has been unleashed every play they’re on the court together.

**The Roberson Rule:**

JJ Reddick is using the NBA regular season as a defensive lab experiment. One theory he’s been beta testing is [Seth Partnow’s “Roberson Rule.”](https://x.com/SethPartnow)

The past week, Aaron Gordon, Russell Westbrook, Dante Exum, Naji Marshall, Jaden McDaniels, Jaylen Clark, and Tarrence Shannon Jr. have received Reddick's version of Partnow's Roberson Rule.

One of the things I always tell agents, scouts, or front office members when discussing shooting is that volume matters. Yes, it’s great to be a 40% shooter from the three-point line, but if the player turns down open → semi-open shots to pass or drive into traffic, the percentage doesn’t matter because they can be put into a box defensively.

The Roberson Rule is that box.

Since January 15th, Los Angeles has been first in defensive rating, opponents’ points in the paint, and opponents’ FG%. The results are straightforward; the lab experiment is working.

Reddick is unwilling to concede gravity to players he doesn’t believe will shoot enough volume to beat them. Instead, he chooses to shrink the defensive shell and shift more gravity to players who *can* beat Los Angeles, like Jokic, Kyrie, and Anthony Edwards.

# Ben Taylor showed what that extra gravity looks like when shifted towards a player (Jokic).

Even a few makes from Gordon and Westbrook didn’t shake his resolve in the Roberson Rule strategy; it takes volume. Your shooting gravity is not defined by your percentage but by a combination of three factors: Percentage, Volume, and Mechanics.

He knows that players who have never shot 15 threes in an NBA game don’t know how to deal with the emotional swings of missing nine threes and it still being a good thing for the team, and he’s betting on players not being able to step that far outside the Overton Window of volume.The Luka Lakers Are Figuring It Out...",1460,107,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j0hguj/the_luka_lakers_are_figuring_it_out_thanks_to/,2025-02-28 15:29:35,"Great article!

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || Side note but remember the “lebron can’t play off ball narrative”

Like idk where the even came from. Ig cause he’s always been the guy with the ball in his hands so they just assume he can’t. Especially with how much his shooting has improved, he’s lethal off ball. Saves energy and now he can use it to get boards, play defense, etc. his vision allows him to be a menace when cutting to the basket too. || Could someone please explain what a “0.5 player” is? I may be missing something, but I read the article on substack and tried a google search and I have not found an explanation that matches the context here. || Just want to point out - We are talking about how a 40 yr old finally unleashed his athleticism. || This was a fun read. Great analysis. Makes a lot of sense with their new personnel being fast enough for a close out on those guys instead of a proper gravity cover. I’ll be on the lookout for this next game. || Great article - one of LeBron’s main strengths has always been how remarkably well rounded he is in his game, combined with his brain. Even with that, I’ve been suprised how fast he has essentially worked out off ball play with Luka - is there any historical parallels of anyone doing this before? || [removed] || [removed] || [removed] || LeBron is trusting Luka - it also gives LeBron more rest and energy to do more dirty work and make plays when it matters, at this age this helps him chill a bit more and dial it up when it matters. || This was a great read, esp as a Laker/Bron fan rooting for him get that last championship run. || [removed] || Hey correct me if I’m wrong please but it feels like Taylor Jenkins also loves the “Roberson rule” and as an all 82 grizzlies watcher it frustrates me more than anything. It worked great vs Jrue Holiday but since then it feels like we’ve been burnt more than helped. || Bro I fucking hate Dallas for this. I’m finally ready to protest something lol || Lebron is getting more catch and shoot 3 opportunities, quality looks made possible by Luka having so much gravity and being an elite passer.

Then of course Lebron can rim run and is one of the best in transition which is easy money for a full court passing threat like Luka

People are mentioning Luka’s shooting slump, which is normal after an injury, but when you realize how often he’s double teamed and blitzed that’s what creates shot quality for other guys || LeBron’s never actually been heliocentric. We’ve gotten too liberal with the word. He’s always given other guys the opportunity to create, he’s always been a good cutter, he’s always utilized some post ups if the guard doesn’t have many options, etc 

Ball dominant? Yes

Heliocentric? No || > But like Highlander, there can be only one, and as to the question of who would be that one for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

I kind of disagree with this framing, as if LeBron playing off ball is the result of Luka being the better player, which he hasn't been in LA so far. LeBron even ceded ball handling duties to Westbrook to become a screen and short roll player when they were in the lineup together. To me this arrangement is the result of LeBron covering up Luka's weakness as an off ball player in the same way he covered up Anthony Davis' weakness as an on ball player. 

Even at this age, LeBron has less weaknesses than Luka and can do everything well and is an elite play initiator and finisher. Depending on what he has on his team, he can do either. So he's adapting his game to utilize the strengths of his teammate because he can in a way less flexible players cannot. || This isn’t accurate.

Since Luka arrived, LeBron’s touches per game have actually increased from 85.6 to 91.2, along with his scoring, which has jumped from 24.5 to 28.2 points per game.

For context, LeBron’s 91.2 touches per game surpass Luka’s 78.2.

Luka has merely come in to play point guard and distribute the ball to LeBron, but he hasn’t yet been the “alpha” or “Highlander” on the Lakers. LeBron has found a way to maintain that role—despite the devastating impact of 0.74 fewer dribbles per touch (shocking!). || I think Denver can put lineups out there (sans Westbrook) where you won’t feel as comfortable as you did last game. 

I think as teams see this more, they'll try to adjust as best they can. 

Boston can handle this coverage (obviously). Doing this on Golden State is scary because even though Green can't shoot, he's always a threat to get into quick two-man game actions with Curry or Buddy, who you must be up at the level to prevent open shots. || Hard to play this defense against the Bucks. I've seen teams all year focus on taking Dame away but then there is Giannis. As for role players AJ Green will gladly jack up 10+ 3s. To a lesser extent so will GTJ and Lopez. Portis & Prince will throw up 10 3s if given open looks as well. || [removed] || Boston, Cleveland || They playing the avgs. || Fully healthy wolves can run a lineup of DDV, Ant, Jaden, Naz, Rudy.   That lineup will launch 3s if left open, that type of defense would have a strong possibility of being a catastrophic decision. || Nice article! My only suggestion would be to explain what a 0.5 man is. I had no idea and had to find that in the comments. The Roberson Rule at least gets explained in the tweet that you have linked in the article (but not here). || nice piece, def enjoyed!  || I was hoping your substack would define this, what is a 0.5 player exactly? || Great work man, posts like yours keep me coming back here. Well done!! || Agreed.  In hindsight, someone with that much knowledge on playmaking is going to be amazing off ball - knowing exactly where to go for other playmakers.",0.0,0.861,0.139,0.4404,0.04,0.814,0.146,0.9985,0.067,0.739,0.194,0.9995
Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-02-27,nbadiscussion,1izg2wq,Oklahoma City: Three BIG Things & Game Notes (vs. Minnesota),"I’m sharing notes from the last two OKC vs. MIN games after the All-Star break, plus three BIG things on Oklahoma City. These were two of the most fun games of the season, highlighted by Minnesota's on-the-road comeback in OKC (25 points).

**Three BIG things have stood out to me this year regarding OKC:**

1. Secondary playmaking options around SGA—*Who* the pocket player is matters!
2. They are a great Regular Season team (GTO); can they also be a great Playoff (FEP) team?
3. SGA: Shooting, Change of Direction Brilliance, Foul grifting, and everything in between.



Secondary Playmaking Options, aka “The Alex Caurso one”:

My biggest takeaway from the season with OKC is examining who will be the player in the decision-making spot after SGA draws two to the ball when it matters most.

SGA brings two players to the basketball often, and he does it in a variety of actions:

* PnR: 9.21% (1628 Total Possessions)(128 Blitzed)
* ISO: 3.05% (787 Total Possessions)(24 Doubles)
* Post: 16.67% (60 Total Possessions)(10 Doubles)

Data by Second Spectrum

The primary way he’s getting two defenders on the ball is via the PnR action. This action will be the action that will make or break Oklahoma City in the playoffs (more on that to come).

*Who* the screener is during these actions will affect the shot quality OKC can produce from these actions. Alex Caruso is the swing piece; he is the one who connects and unlocks many of OKC’s lineups.

* Carsuo has a 0.77 assist rate in PnR actions with SGA this season.

Compare that to SGA’s other primary PnR partners: Hartenstein’s 0.036 assist rate or Holmgren’s 0.039 assist rate, and it’s significantly better.

* Carsuo also has a 0.01 turnover rate in PnR actions with SGA this season.

Compare that to SGA’s other primary PnR partners: Hartenstein’s 0.03 turnover rate or Holmgren’s 0.026 assist rate; again, it’s significantly better.

It will be a big deal for this OKC team to get AC involved in the PnR actions with SGA over Hartenstein and Holmgren whenever possible in the playoffs.

1. What does the OKC playoff rotation look like, and how does that affect the problems they can solve/present to opponents?

The Oklahoma City Thunder currently have [12 players averaging 15 minutes a game;](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/_/name/okc/table/game/sort/avgMinutes/dir/desc) they are one of the deepest teams in the league.

This rotation will have to be cut down when the playoffs roll around, but who gets cut and what skills will go with them to the bench?

OKC has multiple players who could be considered specialists, excelling at one end of the floor, and a few “tweeners,” who are in-between positions and tend to be on the smaller end of their natural positions.

Dort, Wallace, Wiggins, and Joe.

Where these guys fit into the playoff rotation and puzzle will be a big deal.

* Dort brings a defensive presence on the other team’s best perimeter player but leaves a bit to be desired offensively.
* Wallace is as steady as they get. Good on the ball, never late in rotations, and makes the right play. But he’s undersized and doesn’t shoot it well enough off movement to be a starting shooting guard that scares you enough to have him pull significant gravity on the offensive end.
* Wiggins is a big swing player for this team. Is this a hot streak, or has this guy hit a Matrix moment? Is he now a starting shooting guard who will hit shots at a high clip and be a second-side playmaker?
* Joe has always been one of my favorite shooters in the league, even when he was in Philly. But he’s on the smaller end regarding weight and doesn’t bring much to the table regarding ball handling or second-side playmaking in 4v3 situations.

Whoever emerges from this group to join SGA, Williams, Holmgren, Hartenstein, and Caruso in the playoff rotation will significantly influence the team's ability to present and solve problems in each playoff series.

1. SGA:

SGA has the best combination of changing direction, putting defenders off balance or out of rhythm, and finishing around the rim in the league.

I wrote extensively about SGA last year, so I won’t dive too deep into the weeds here.

My opinion during the 23/24 season on SGA was that while he could be the league’s MVP, he was still not quite ready to be the best player on a championship team. This perspective/take was influenced by one specific type of shot he was unwilling to shoot: the downhill PnR pull-up three.

When I worked with NBA players, I always created a SWOT analysis of their game. Each player’s “threats” section is unique based on their goals and status in the league. I did a SWOT analysis on SGA last year. The grading scale I used was that of a player trying to be the best player in every playoff series, a lofty goal that requires a harsh lens.

In 23/24, his downhill PnR actions lacked a three-point shot. It's not that he couldn’t make it, but he wasn’t even taking it.

Seeing him look to add this specific shot to his game has been one of the most fun development stories to track. It’s a shot that makes him as close to an unsolvable puzzle as possible, and if he can take and make this shot at volume, he can be the best player in every series.

**The OKC Victory:**

OKC—The SGA and Caruso PnR chemistry is popping as the season progresses. AC is good at finding the pockets of space after the screen, and SGA trusts AC to make plays for himself or others.

OKC—The defense is just so stingy at giving up paint drives. Quick and forceful switches at the point of attack—clear rules and communication. You rarely see them caught on the back foot.

This defense makes their offense hum. It’s much easier to attack when you're playing off turnovers and missed shots.

OKC—SGA is so talented on the left side of the court. His ability to get into your body (dig) and then get away (glide) into open space behind him to shoot is elite.

OKC—SGA downhill PnR three to end the 2nd. This is the shot I'm watching all season and into the playoffs. This shot puts him over the top as a guy who can be the best player in EVERY series, not just some.

OKC—Conley hits a PnR three vs. Hartenstein. How do they play him? Drop? Switch? Is he a spot in the defense teams will attack? Next time we see this PnR, Hartenstein is up more to the level, then into a drop, and SGA shrinks off Clark from the strong side to deter the McDanials roll pass.

How well Hartenstein can hold up in these actions vs. high-level shooters will be a big deal.

OKC—The Hartenstein floater is a really fun shot. When I worked with an All-NBA big, I was a big proponent of this shot's ability to differentiate you from others. I saw it by watching Jokic every night when working with Beasley; I wonder if Hartenstein did, too.

MIN—The McDaniels as a screener when he’s being guarded by a big is fun! Not stashing him in the corner and allowing the big to roam helps to open up good 4v3 attacking options when paired with Edwards or Conley in the PnR.

**McDaniels Points Per Direct As Screener in PnR:**

* Edwards: 1.052
* Conley: 1.385

It’s a small sample size, only 154 total actions, but it’s popping on film. MIN pairs him in the action with a strong shooter when another team’s five-man guards him. It looks like they’re getting to it more and more.

OKC—What a close to the 3rd for SGA. There is a drastic difference in his off-the-dribble shooting when he can get to his step back rather than go downhill. He’s so talented at that particular shot, and you can tell he loves to shoot it.

OKC—Caruso shooting is one of this team's most significant swing skills for the playoffs. They will be challenging to beat if he can shoot the ball at a high clip with enough volume. AC has been an okay shooter on okay volume for his career

**Career Three-Point Shooting:**

* Volume: 2.7
* Percentage: 37.6

If he’s better than okay, this team will win a championship. The SGA-AC-Williams trio plus one big is an absolute unit on both ends of the floor!

SGA-AC-Williams + Hartenstine: 

99 possessions is a minimal sample size, but +42.1 and 125.3 per 100 possessions on offense with 83.2 points per 100 on defense and a 21.8% turnover rate… Sign me up for that group!

SGA-AC-Williams + Holmgren: 

51 possessions, again, is a minimal sample size, but +56.6 and 151.0 per 100 possessions on offense with 94.3 points per 100 on defense and a 24.5% turnover rate… Again, give me more!

OKC—If they put a three-point barrage line they did in the middle of the 4th, it makes beating them seem impossible. Those shots gave SGA space to operate in ISO actions, and he’s otherworldly at getting defenders off rhythm and off balance while he is playing in rhythm and on balance. His Dig → Glide shot going left is truly unstoppable.

**The MIN Victory:**

OKC—The step-back threes on the left wing are the signature SGA threes. It's tough to do anything but pray if you're Reid.

OKC—Are Wallace, Joe, and Wiggins big enough to all play together in the playoffs? Can only two of them play together?

OKC—Will Wiggins shoot this shot in the playoffs? He's a game-changer if he's this aggressive *and* making shots.

MIN-McDaniels has found a nice groove using his size to get into rhythm and balance midrange looks. I love the PnR stuff they are running with him screening and playing downhill in the pocket.

OKC—SGA foul-grifting at its finest. These are not basketball plays--OKC announcer: “he was going for the foul.”

OKC—I could watch Joe shoot a basketball all day; he can spin it! His skip-shot transition three was beautiful.

OKC—Their defense is like a brick wall. They are so damn good at guarding their yard and working to keeping the ball out of the paint.

OKC—When they see the other team play zone, they quickly find the soft spot in the middle via the pass quicker than any other team in the league.

OKC—SGA downhill three on the PnR. This is interesting. This is the shot that pushes him into the place of the best player on a championship Team

MIN—Reid is a matchup nightmare. He can handle and shoot it too well to be covered by a center, and if he gets a smaller guy in the post, he can get to the jump hook going over either shoulder.

MIN—In the 3rd, Conley, Reid, and Edwards start flopping to get calls on SGA. Is this what the NBA wants? These players are smart; they'll adjust to a winning strategy. If flopping and gritting get these results, they'll all do it.

OKC—The lineup of SGA-Joe-Wiggins-AC-Williams is small but feisty, and they can move the ball. This lineup is built to get great shots when SGA gets blitzed. But can they rebound and guard?

\^ +4 during their stretch. Will this be the OKC break in case of an emergency lineup when they need to speed the game up or get something going offensively?

\^\^ 17 possessions is a minimal sample size, but +59.6 and 147.1 per 100 possessions on offense with 87.5 points per 100 on defense and a 31.2% turnover rate… WHOA!

OKC—The process is excellent in the 4th. The missed shots make the results look worse. However, they are getting high-quality looks through a great offensive process.

**Process vs. Results (4th Quarter)**

* OKC: qSQ of 56.06 but shot an eFG% of 24.14 *(-31.93)*.
* MIN: qSQ of 44.74 but shot an eFG% of 61.36 *(+16.62).*

Data by Second Spectrum

OKC—The five-man lineup that kicked ass to end the 3rd was out there to try to close the game out in the 4th sans one exception (Dort → Joe). This type of conundrum is the biggest question for OKC. Their top defensive options leave question marks offensively, but their top offensive options leave them small and exposed defensively.

19 possessions is a minimal sample size, but -88.2 and 36.8 points per 100 possessions on offense and 125.0 points per 100 on defense is more like…

Who from the Joe, Dort, Wallace, and Wiggins group will be the options OKC will bet on when the chips are down? Will they lean into defense and hope to survive offensively, or will they lean into offense and try to cover for their guys/pray that the other teams miss?

MIN—No Edwards on the floor during this big comeback; it’s the Naz Reid show. He makes some plays look so effortless. It’s unicorn stuff from someone his size.

MIN—Anthony Edwards with a huge block, he takes the match-up with SGA personally; I don’t know what happened between them or if it’s more of an “I’m the alpha here” type of thing, but it’s spicy with Edwards, and I’m here for it.

This is fun!!**",50,12,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1izg2wq/oklahoma_city_three_big_things_game_notes_vs/,2025-02-27 08:43:16,"This was a great read. OKC are my personal favourites but definitely intrigued to see how it works out in the playoff. Keep up the great work! || You hit on the biggest weakness of the OKC offense which is that they just don't have enough guys who can make decisions and attack a mismatch. 

We will see obviously how chet changes things for him as he gets back to 100%- he can possibly be amazing offensively for them. 

But really guys like isaiah Joe and Dort are very one dimensional on offense. They're never going to attack a mismatch

Moreover SGA is the only guy who can run a respectable playoff level pick and roll in the entire starting lineup. 

He needs a real offensive player who can get downhill, shoot, and run a pick and roll as his point guard. 

JDub is great because of his 2 way potential. But offensively he isn't as athletic in terms of blowing by guys and his only real mismatches are on guys smaller than him. 

This is important because you look out east and the Celtics have FIVE guys who can run a pick and roll and attack mismatches and are great defensively. || Upvote for the data collection and your synergetic transcription of knowledge, and for da MVP, Mr. SGA. Great work!! || This is some worthy discussion post that will get undermined by other shitty narratives. Appreciate your effort OP![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote) || The flopping by the Wolves players on defense is because SGA is one of those players who is really physical offensively, but is also really skilled at going into a gather quickly offensively so when a defender tries to match SGA’s physicality it becomes a shooting foul.  At that point, your options are to play what would be fundamentally sound defense against most players (hold your ground), but in this case turns into a shooting foul, give ground while trying to prevent a layup, which given SGA’s moves in the paint is bad defense, or flop.

The NBA’s gather rules turning a player into a shooter when they are going downhill is being exploited for shots that are not layups too often, and often you have the offensive player initiating contact while in the gather so a defender holding their ground to the contact initiated by the offensive player is a defensive foul unless they are in place to draw a charge (which is almost always a help defender doing that).  

Best fix is to only give the extended gather for actual layups, and not to cases where a drive turns into a short paint jump shot or floater.  This would mean refs would have to wait after contact to see if the player is actually shooting a layup or not when the defender commits contact deemed a foul on a shooter but not a driver.  This will also remove a lot of the foul baiting as those are mostly seeking contact then throwing up a jump shot, most fans like the seeking contact on a layup as good basketball.

Other fix (this one won’t happen) is bringing back pre MJ traveling rules, that removed a lot step back 3’s, eurosteps, and current paint moves on drivers that are being used for foul bating a lot (not the step back, but the other two are). || There are a lot of film edits/clips that add context to the words written above.

Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-03-07,nbadiscussion,1j6drah,Did the Allen Iverson Trade Stunt Carmelo Anthony’s Growth?,"
I feel like the Allen Iverson trade slowed down Melo’s growth, both skill-wise and as a leader.

Melo Was on Track to Develop an All-Around Game

Before AI arrived in Denver, Melo was starting to expand his game beyond just scoring. He was improving as a playmaker and showing signs of becoming the undisputed leader of the Nuggets. At the start of the 2006-07 season, he was averaging 31.6 PPG and looking like he could develop into a more complete player—similar to LeBron at that time.

But once Iverson joined, the offense turned into a “my turn, your turn” system. Instead of Melo growing into the kind of player who dictated everything on the court, he had to share ball-handling and scoring duties with another high-usage player. That slowed his natural progression toward being a well-rounded superstar.

LeBron Had the Freedom to Grow—Melo Didn’t

Compare this to LeBron’s situation in Cleveland during the same era. The Cavs built everything around LeBron, allowing him to be the unquestioned leader and primary decision-maker. Without another superstar competing for shots and possessions, LeBron naturally evolved into an elite playmaker and all-around force.
	•	2007 LeBron: Led the Cavs to the Finals with complete control over the offense.
	•	2009 LeBron: Won MVP, averaging 28-7-7, because the entire system was built around his strengths.
	•	2010 LeBron: Put up one of the most dominant individual seasons ever before heading to Miami.

Melo, on the other hand, was never given that same level of control because Iverson’s presence forced Denver to play a different style. Instead of refining his playmaking and leadership, he was primarily used as a go-to scorer.

Iverson’s Presence Delayed Melo’s Leadership Growth

Another major issue was leadership. AI was a dominant personality, and while he wasn’t a traditional leader, his presence meant Melo didn’t have to fully step up. Instead of learning how to take over a team and hold teammates accountable, Melo had the luxury of deferring at times.

It wasn’t until Chauncey Billups arrived in 2008 that Melo had a veteran who actually pushed him to be a more mature leader. That’s a big reason why the Nuggets finally made a deep playoff run in 2009. If Denver had focused on Melo’s all-around growth earlier—like Cleveland did with LeBron—his trajectory could have been different.

Final Thoughts

Had Denver built the team around Melo’s complete game rather than pairing him with another high-usage scorer, I think he could have developed into a more well-rounded superstar, similar to LeBron. The AI trade might have been exciting in the moment, but in the long run, it probably slowed down Melo’s evolution as both a player and a leader.",168,98,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j6drah/did_the_allen_iverson_trade_stunt_carmelo/,2025-03-08 04:39:57,"I don't like to do hypotheticals with Melo. 

Sure, maybe some extra time as the unquestioned leader in Denver could've been transformative. But you could just as easily make the argument that playing alongside another ball-dominant player should've forced Melo to develop as an off-ball player, practice his contribution to set plays where he isn't the focus, finetune his defensive effort, and so on. 

Melo is an all-time scorer. He'll almost certainly get into the Hall of Fame, and whatever my feelings as a Denver fan might be, he will almost certainly deserve it. But there were always limitations to his game, and despite all the moments where it looked like he might finally work on them, he never really stuck with it for long. 

It's rough, but I don't think any one moment in his career prevented him from developing into a different kind of superstar. He just spent his career deciding not to do that. || So when Carmelo was playing with the Knicks and the injuries started happening to Amare, Carmelo was forced to play a lot of power forward. He did it so much that he is actually listed as a PF for 2 seasons and he played it very well. It was probably the best basketball of his career, rebounds were up and he was more efficient. Carmelo is a big slow SF but at PF he had an athletic advantage over almost everyone. Even with all of that evidence, he essentially refused to continue playing that position. To me that sums up Carmelo, he refuses to grow as player, happy to stay in the lane he’s always been in. || [removed] || No if anything melo plays best with a point guard who passes and runs an offense. Melo can’t be like LeBron, Luka, etc because he was usually a selfish player looking for his own shots instead of creating for others and passing. 

It’s ironic that LeBron won a scoring title before melo and yet LeBron has played with a huge passing game from the get go. || Melo stunted his own growth by never committing to defense, facilitation and movement without the ball

  
P.S. He was my favorite player growing up because I did not understand the importance of the above || No, I don’t think so. His refusal to put any consistent effort on defense was always going to be a problem, not even having Chauncey Billups as his mentor motivated him to try to become more of a locker room leader or team player. Melo, for all his talent, skills, and physical gifts, has always been about himself moreso than buying into a team first mentality. Hell, he wouldn’t even wait for free agency to join up with his childhood friends in LeBron and Wade and instead rushed to sign a contract instead as soon as he could, the Miami Heatles was originally supposed to be Melo instead of Bosh but Melo went after the money instead. || No, his problem wasn’t on offense at all. Melo was a walking bucket whether he tried or not. The main problem with him was his own effort and focus on non-scoring parts of his game. Remember Olympic Melo where he hustled all the time? He was like that against marquee match ups vs Kobe, LeBron, DWade, but barely try against no name teams. He was famously known for playing ip to the level of his competition and teammate with the Nuggets. 

When AI came into town, I remember Karl asking him to become more of a rebounder and an off ball defender, and his rebounds went up quite a hit but he looked really unhappy doing so. George Karl might’ve been an asshole, but he was completely correct in identifying that Melo barely tried when it wasn’t a big game. || Iverson was only there for 2 seasons. This would be like saying Westbrook stunted the development of Austin Reaves. || I don’t remember all-around Melo.  I was just bummed when he got away from his post game which was phenomenal || I understand your perspective and it’s an interesting thought. I can’t say that he was stunted but I do remember him being an all around player at some point. I remember he went from just scoring to actually playing and controlling a game and playing within a system. 

He was passing more, posting up, playing defense, and looked like a great top player in the league at that time. Then for some reason it all stopped. I remember those days of Melo. 

I watch his podcast and he talks about when Iverson came they decided to go back and forth and take turns. So, maybe you are right there. || [removed] || The trade of Billips for AI was what the team and Melo needed, but Melo is Melo - he just wanted to score and don’t think much would have changed who he is || No early indications that Melo had passing/playmaking chops. This feels more like narrative than analysis. Lebron came into the league a passer.

If Iverson being there for a couple seasons that much of an obstacle for Melo, then his potential was too fragile to have much chance at success.

Players are supposed to play with other players. Thinking guys “need their own teams” was a dumb paradigm from the early 2000s that resulted in things like Marbury leaving KG and Tmac leaving Vince. || [removed] || [removed] || I think he's the most overrated player of modern times. I would say to what Howard next. They were both incredibly incomplete. Built to leverage their skills properly but neither player with smart enough to fine tune himself. They both were way too egotistical and focused on scoring as a detriment of their team.  || This is the reality of Carmelo [Game of Zones: Melo’s time in Houston](https://youtu.be/6SGvnwsbf88) || Definitely didn’t stunt his growth and remember melo got suspended for that fight right before AI got traded to Denver. I believe melo was leading league in scoring or at least top 2 when he got suspended. || He literally chose the bag over playing with his friends and forming a big 3, nearly guaranteeing a championship. 

He stunted his own growth || They traded AI for Chauncey Billups who led the Nuggets to the WCF.  So no, Carmelo just isn’t a KD level player. || I don't think Melo ever had (or would have had) the desire or ability to grow into the allo around superstar people wanted him to become.  
He was an extremely gifted scorer with holes in his game and conditioning , him being a top 5 player in the league was the anomaly , not the rule.  
Iso scoring was highly valued at the time , today he would probably be a top 10-15 player in the league , he never had the talent for playmaking. || No, analytics destroyed Melo’s game.. the same way it did to Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose and many others. We learned their style of basketball is inefficient so teams went away from running their offense through them. || What stunt his growth was the early success. He came into the league when the hype was around LeBron. But Melo had more success in the first couple of years where he carried his team into the playoffs. And his team often beat LeBron's team head to head. Melo always thought he was the better player and so he got big headed. 

Eventually, LeBron got better and started to live up to his hype as a generational player, while Melo was just a really good player and he stayed there. 

During the 2008 Olympics when the Redeem Team won gold, Kobe influenced LeBron, Wade, and KD to pay better defensively. They went back to NBA and show improvements in their game, but Melo stay the same. To him, he was Kobe's equal and so didn't need to learn anything. He got big headed due to early NBA success and never bother to improve his game. || Melo didn't give any signs of developing as a passer or on defense. Allen Iverson played for 135 games on Denver in 2 years. Thats not a lot. Sure, having both of them on the floor was not a good thing but Carmelo was always a scorer and a little bit of a rebounder, nothing more. Its not on Iverson or anyone other than Carmelo. || Honestly, this reads as a someone who didn’t watch that in the moment. Unfortunately, Melo hit his ceiling regardless of others. He was an incredible bucket getter and a big body who could shuffle his feat on D, allowing him to guard 2-4. 

But he was a bucket-getter first and foremost. That’s why he and AI didnt work. || Since you bring up the ‘09 playoffs let’s not forget when Chauncey melo and the nugs beat cp3 and NO by 60 in a playoff game || On the Knicks Melo had a chance to grow but he chose to stay the same Melo. Melo stunted his own growth Look at Harden who was forced to play differently with CP3. 

He grew into a true pg on the Nets and Sixers. Now we’re seeing a different Harden on the Clippers. || In what was one of his best seasons, that 12-13 knicks season, he averaged 28.7 ppg and 2.6 assists. A big time offensive engine type of player should be getting at 5-6 assists at the least with those kinds of points, gotta generate more team offense than that if you want to be one of the best offensive players in the league. || Melo's leadership growth?  You're talking about potential that wasn't there.  Melo is a follower.

LeBron is a natural born leader, so it wasn't a matter of LeBron having room to grow into it.  It was already there.

Melo even felt the reality of that dynamic because he became a follower of LeBron himself very early in their relationship when they were still teenagers.  Next thing you know Melo is on the banana boat.

Recall when LeBron saved Melo's life in the Bahamas:

>*I look up and the current is taking me into the middle of the ocean, opposite from the boat.  Then I look up at the boat and I see Bron, Bron jumps off the boat like he's MacGyver. He jumps off the boat into the water. He was bringing me back with one arm. He's swimming with the other arm, and he's carrying in one arm. That was special. He saved my life.*

LeBron has a charisma, presence and natural leadership qualities that Melo doesn't have and would never be able to cultivate. || Imagine if AI got traded to the Cavs - him and Lebron would’ve been electric. 

I think people are who they are and knowing melo for 20 years of public spotlight - he’s more in line with Kobe mentality (minus the killer mindset.)",0.0,0.755,0.245,0.3818,0.028,0.85,0.122,0.9923,0.081,0.775,0.144,0.9992

Ants on court ORTG is a 114.9

Gobert’s was 112.5 || Because when he isnt on the court the numbers are better and vice versa.

Individual off rating and defensive rating dont really tell us anything because its still highly dependent on roster and lineups. 

So while Rudy has a higher offensive and defensive rating than Ant, that offensive rating might increase when hes off the court because the Wolves ran a KAT + Naz lineup which is better offensively and thus reduced the impact. Since Rudy wasnt as good on defense in 2022-23, the better offense made up for it. 

In the case of Ant, while his numbers arent insane it just shows that without him the Wolves posted up worse numbers than 106 and 113. Which despite the fact that those numbers are actually really not good, the rest of the team was unable to keep it together in the moments Ant sat. || I think it’s because ORtg and Drtg are mostly calculated based on possessions in which the individual is used. My guess is the correlation between ortg/drtg and plus/minus is moderated by usage such that the correlation is stronger in high usage players and weaker in low usage players. 

Does anyone know where you can find on-court/off-court numbers that are broken down for defense and offense? The drtg rating in particular seems like a bad metric. || Thanks, that clears it up.

In fact, when compared to other scoring champs, he’s about average","SGA is shooting 8.9 FTA per game so far this season, good for 2nd this year (Giannis, 10.2). Since he’s probably going to end up being the scoring champion, I wanted to see how this stacks up against other scoring champions, and see if there’s really any truth to the free throw merchant allegations. 

TLDR; Since 86-87 there has been 13 seasons (out of 38) where the scoring leader shot less free throws than SGA this season. Carmelo Anthony and Steph Curry are the only scoring champions who have never had a season with more FTA than SGA this season. 7 of those 13 seasons are Michael Jordan. Elite scorers get fouled because they’re impossible to guard

Because I have organic chemistry homework and I don’t want to do this all night, I started in 86-87 (Jordan’s first scoring title), and looked at FTA for all players that led the league in scoring. Here’s what I found:

Last years scoring champion, Luka Doncic, averaged 8.7 FTA per game. In 2022-23 he shot 10.5 FTA per game and in 2019-20 he shot 9.2 FTA per game, giving him 2 seasons where he averaged more FTA than SGA this year. 

In the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons, Joel Embiid was the leading scorer. He averaged 11.8 FTA in 21-22 and 11.7 in 22-23. He also averaged 9.2 in 20-21 and 10.2 in 23-24, giving him 4 seasons with more FTA than SGA this season. 

Steph Curry was the scoring champion in 15-16 and 20-21. He averaged 5.1 in 15-16 and 6.3 in 20-21. He has never had a season above 6.3 FTA per game. 

James Harden was the scoring champ in 17-18, 18-19, and 19-20. In 17-18 he averaged 10.1 FTA, in 18-19 he averaged 11.0 FTA, and in 19-20 he averaged 11.8 FTA. He also averaged 10.9 in 16-17, 10.2 in 15-16, 10.2 in 14-15, 10.2 in 12-13, and 9.1 in 13-14, giving him 8 seasons with more FTA than SGA this year. 

Russell Westbrook was the scoring champ in 14-15 and 16-17. He averaged 9.8 FTA in 14-15 and 10.4 in 16-17. Those are his only 2 seasons with more FTA than SGA this year. 

Kevin Durant was the scoring champ in 09-10, 10-11, 11-12, and 13-14. In 09-10 he averaged 10.2 FTA, 8.7 in 10-11, 7.6 in 11-12, and 9.9 in 13-14. He also averaged 9.3 in 12-13, giving him 3 seasons with more FTA than SGA this season. 

Carmelo Anthony was the scoring champion in 12-13, averaging 7.6 FTA per game  In 09-10 and 05-06 he averaged 8.9 FTA per game, giving him 2 seasons where he was tied with SGA. 

In 08-09 Dwayne Wade was the scoring champion, averaging 9.8 FTA per game. He averaged 10.7 in 05-06, 10.5 in 06-07, 9.9 in 04-05, 9.2 in 07-08, and 9.1 in 09-10, giving him 6 seasons with more FTA than SGA this year. 

In 07-08 Lebron James was the scoring champion, averaging 10.3 FTA per game. He also averaged 10.3 in 05-06, 10.2 in 09-10, 9.4 in 08-09, and 9.0 in 06-07, giving him 5 seasons with more FTA than SGA this year. 

In 05-06 and 06-07, Kobe Bryant was the scoring champion, averaging 10.2 FTA in 05-06 and 10.0 in 06-07. He also averaged 10.1 in 04-05 and 9.0 in 07-08, giving him 4 seasons with more FTA than SGA this season. 

Tracy McGrady was scoring champion in 02-03 and 03-04. He averaged 9.7 FTA in 02-03 and 7.5 in 03-04. He has one season with more FTA than SGA this season. 

Allen Iverson was scoring champion in 04-05, 01-02, 00-01, and 98-99. He averaged 10.5 FTA in 04-05, 9.8 in 01-02, 10.1 in 00-01, 9.9 in 98-99. He also averaged 11.5 in 05-06, 9.7 in 07-08, 9.5 in 03-04, 9.4 in 06-07, 9.0 in 02-03, and 8.9 in 99-00, giving him 10 seasons with more FTA than SGA this season. 

(This one is formatted differently because MJ led the league in scoring way too many times). Michael Jordan was scoring champion in 86-87 (11.9), 87-88 (10.5), 88-89 (9.8), 89-90 (8.5), 90-91 (8.2), 91-92 (7.4), 92-93 (7.3), 95-96 (8.0), 96-97 (7.0), and 97-98 (8.8). He also averaged 9.1 FTA in 84-85, giving him 4 seasons with more FTA than SGA this season. 

Shaquille O’Neal was the scoring champion in 99-00 and 94-95. He averaged 10.8 FTA in 94-95 and 10.4 in 99-00. He also averaged 13.1 in 00-01, 11.4 in 97-98, 10.8 in 02-03, 10.7 in 01-02, 10.5 in 93-94, 10.5 in 04-05, 10.2 in 98-99, 10.1 in 03-04, 9.5 in 95-96, 9.4 in 96-97, and 8.9 in 92-93, giving him 12 seasons where he shot more FTA than SGA this season and 1 where he was tied. 

David Robinson was scoring champion in 93-94 with 11.6 FTA per game. He also averaged 10.5 in 94-95, 10.2 in 89-90, 10.0 in 95-96, 9.5 in 90-91, 9.3 in 92-93, and 9.0 in 97-98, giving him 7 seasons with more FTA than SGA this season.

**Gary Payton** (in his last season in Seattle) and **Brent Barry** had VORPs of **5.9** and **5.8** respectively with **Rashard Lewis** contributing a **3.2** VORP. Everyone else on the team had a VORP **below 1.0**.

By comparison, the championship Lakers that year, which were extremely top heavy as well, had **Shaq** (**6.1**), **Kobe** (**5.2**), **Horry** (**3.0**). Top heavy, but actually slightly less so than those Sonics. They had players with VORPs above 1.0. The LeBron Heat teams which are another obvious candidate had other contributors with VORPs above 1.0 as well outside their Big 3.

By comparison, this season, only 3 players in the entire league have VORPs above 5.0 - **Jokic** (**9.1**), **Shai** (**8.6**), and **Giannis** (**6.0**). The next closest is **Tatum** at **4.6**.

I looked for teams this year with at least 2 players with a VORP at 3.2 or above and saw these 5:

* Thunder: Shai (8.6), Jalen Williams (3.2)
* Cavaliers: Jarrett Allen (3.5), Evan Mobley (3.3)
* Celtics: Jayson Tatum (4.6), Derrick White (3.3)
* Knicks: Josh Hart (3.4), Karl-Anthony Towns (3.3)
* Bucks: Giannis (6.0), Damian Lillard (3.2)

By the end of the year, the Rockets may have 2 players qualify (Amen Thompson is at 3.1 and Sengun is already at 3.8) and the Cavaliers may have 3 (Mitchell is at 3.1).

Not a single team this year has 3 players with a 3.2 VORP or better though. And every playoff team has contributions with VORPs over 1.0.

  
Does anyone remember this Sonics team? Statistically, they had a better Big 3 than the championship Lakers and the #2 contender Spurs. In fact, Payton and Barry seemed to be a better big 2 than both Shaq and Kobe and Duncan and Robinson. But they got little contribution elsewhere outside Rashard Lewis.",53,14,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jrea75/200102_seattle_supersonics_most_top_heavy_playoff/,2025-04-04 11:12:30,"Man, I loved that team.

the reigning champs had the problem that they took too long to transition between the inefficient duncan led offense to a efficient ginobili led offense, parker won the fmvp and wants a larger role but he is simply not good enough. duncan is out of his prime, ginobili has 2 years left, parker has not entered it yet. the team is not constructed for the necessary change, instead they stick with the old players and to stagger the parker minutes they keep bringing ginobili from the bench.

the team looks like this, only 6 regular players average at least 20min

Duncan (31) 34mpg **VORP 4.8** BPM 5.2 **TS% 54**

Parker (25) 33mpg **VORP 2.6** BPM 2.4 **TS% 54**

Ginobili (30) 31mpg **VORP 6.0** BPM 8.0 **TS% 61**

Bowen (36) 30mpg **VORP 0.4** BPM -1.4 TS% 52

Finley (34) 26mpg **VORP 0.8** BPM -0.6 TS% 51

Oberto (32) 20mpg **VORP 1.0** BPM 0.4 TS% 61

they finish 56-26 only 1 game behind the 1st seeded Lakers. in the playoffs they reach the WCF but fall to the Lakers 1-4. Ginobili was dealing with an injury that made him lose his speed and elevation the entire run and the old guys could not rise to the level.

this is a good example of a typical playoff-build team, and why they fail. playoff teams need a sixth man kind of player to shake things up when things like injuries happen.

this season to me that team is the warriors. they look good for the last 20 or so games but in the playoffs it is very likely that if they can advance they will start dealing with minor injuries and it doesn't look like they have that Poole type of player like the last time they won. || Was it Vlad Radmanovic with the braids or was it the year after? || I think the '76 Lakers might edge them out with Kareem posting a 9.1 and the entire team going for just 10.2 ('22 Nuggets at 12.4 total).

Anthony Edwards,"""Anthony Edwards"" OR ""Anthony"" OR ""Edwards""",2025-04-03,nbadiscussion,1jrdwn9,2024-25 All-NBA Teams Based on Average Ranking Across 8 Popular Advanced Metrics,"I was curious as to find a way to compile multiple advanced metrics to see if any consensus could be derived about the All-NBA teams this season. I am no mathematician and I do not know much about statistics, so I just decided to take some time and find the answer to the easiest question:

*What is the average rank for each All-NBA eligible player across multiple popular advanced metrics this season?*

This was more for my personal curiosity. I do not claim that this method actually has any validity or importance, but I did the work so I thought I would share.

**METHOD:**

*stats collected on 4/3*

To do this I referenced the 8 following advanced metrics that I see commonly used:

EPM, EW, LEBRON WAR(LW), RAPTOR WAR(RW), DARKO DPM(DPM), PER, WS, and VORP

I decided to include both EPM and EW because I think EPM is the best advanced metric so I wanted to give it some extra weight.

In order to compile the list of players best deserving of All-NBA recognition, I first went through each advanced metric for this season and gave each player a tally for an appearance in the top 20 in each of the stats.

I ended up with a list of 23 players who appeared in the top 20 in >3 out of the 8 stats, who are also likely to meet the 65 games played requirement. I had a few players that surprised me, but generally speaking it aligned with my preconceived idea of who was in contention for All-NBA recognition so I decided to roll with it. The only notable omission was Cade Cunningham who appeared in the top 20 in only 2 out of the 8 advanced metrics. Due to his narrative and likelihood of achieving All-NBA recognition, I included him.

Here are the 24 players:

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

Nikola Jokic

Giannis Antetokounmpo (Likely)

Jayson Tatum

Evan Mobley

Donovan Mitchell

Tyrese Haliburton

Ivica Zubac

Stephen Curry (Likely)

Darius Garland

Derrick White

Jarret Allen

Anthony Edwards

Karl-Anthony Towns

Domantas Sabonis (Likely)

Alperen Sengun

James Harden

Jalen Williams

Josh Hart

LeBron James

Tyler Herro

Jaren Jackson Jr.

Jalen Brunson (Likely)

Cade Cunningham

In the following table, I list each player with each of their respective RANKS in each advanced metric. This is not the metric itself, it is just the RANK in which their metric lies in comparison to their peers. 14 in the table means the 14th best number in the league for that respective stat.

At the end of the table, I include two averages. The first average is their average rank across all 8 advanced metrics. The second average (AVG(IMP)) is their average rank across the 5 all around impact metrics (EPM, EW, RAPTOR WAR, LEBRON WAR, and DARKO DPM). I believe these metrics to be different in kind to the others, so I wanted to see their averages separately.

**NOTES**

\-Haliburton being so loved by advanced metrics definitely surprised me given the narrative about him earlier this season. I would be curious to see his metrics if he can put together a full season of consistent play. Advanced metrics understandably love you if you push pace, generate great looks, and rarely turn the ball over.

\-Derrick White being so beloved by advanced metrics was not necessarily surprising, but the fact that it was enough to rank top 15 in this group of players is impressive. He is the epitome of a winning player.

\-While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated. I believe he deserves a lot more love for his performance this season(DPOY anyone?).

\-LeBron, JJJ, Brunson, and Cade not ranking well is definitely not what I expected going into this. Most of the conversation around these players land them in Second Team at worst and I have even heard arguments around these players to claim the 5th First Team spot.

This likely means nothing to most people, but there may be a few sickos who find this interesting.",294,44,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jrdwn9/202425_allnba_teams_based_on_average_ranking/,2025-04-04 10:56:58,"I have long thought Zubac criminally underrated but this HAS to be the most surprising result.  (Looking to see how EW calculated…) || Man Zubac is awesome, eye test tells me he's a great center -- but I still think there is some black box of these stats where they are giving what a center does more weight than other positions.

**Edited** to mention their extremely great health this season has a lot to do with it as they're all eligible for these honors. || I did that a while back and was really surprised how each metrics have their clear bias baked in yet top 4, r guys seem to be all unanimous. Like EPM favors offensive usage, LEBRON favors players that fit well into winning teams, DARKO really favors establish stats, etc. but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context. These metrics are really helpful to find out underrated role players, but for stars, they can be extremely misleading. || It’s crazy that the Cavs best player isn’t even one of the 4 in this analysis  || Very interesting perspective, thank you for sharing!

Zubac is a beast || Interesting stuff. Thanks for gathering this data and breaking it all down. Unfortunately, I think you're right that due to media narrative, there is no chance Brunson and LeBron get left off, and it's likely that Cade and JJJ will make it. Although those guys have all had very good seasons so it's not like it will be a travesty for any one of them to get the nod.

Zubac has almost no chance, as deserving as he is (I've been very impressed with him in the few clippers games I've watched this year) and White and Allen will likely miss the cut. I'd love to see Allen make it. The guy is such a great two way player and he's so unselfish on offense. He really makes the Cavs a much better team. || Jarrett Allen and Ivica Zubac ranking #3 and #4 in win shares is an indictment of that statistic.

> While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated.

I agree with the first part of your statement. But given that reality, why are you then trying to use these insignificant statistics to draw conclusions?

Zubac and Allen have roles to play and they play them well, but role players don't deserve to be ranked ahead of guys like Brunson or Cunningham who have far more difficult burdens to carry. || Why would you base it off metrics nobody uses?

Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil.  They’re useless.  

Obviously this isn’t how the teams are selected.  

Harden hasn’t made an all nba team in 5 years and he’s not going to make one over LeBron, who was the February player of the month and 5th on mvp ladder. || [removed] || Ultimately, the players are very close in a lot of these metrics so one good game or bad game down the stretch could vastly change the calculus for this analysis. 

  
For example, Ant had a good game last night and EW updated so now Ant is up from #10 all the way to #5. This alone would likely push Ant firmly into second team if I were to re run the analysis. But as of 4/3, these were the rankings. || Before Kawhi started playing like Kawhi, I thought Zubac was easily the most important Clipper. And for a team that was projected to be a lottery team to have a shot at 50-wins, that's Hella impressive || PER notoriously overweighs rebounding, so bigs pretty much always have higher PER than guards of similar quality. TBH it's a very flawed advanced stat that shouldnt be included in any analysis including this one imo. || The hate towards him was crazy. The people that were saying that haven't actually watched him play in a meaningful amount. He is the best pure creator in the league, hands down. His three point shooting, while streaky at times, is upper echelon. His defense is improving significantly as he gets more experience. He has moved to being a solidly average defender, when he was often a genuine liability in the past.

He still catches hate from people who like to make similar arguments against him that people do for John Stockton. It's baffling to me that people attempt to make straight faced arguments against these players because they make a high volume of ""easy assists"". You are seriously going to hold it against a player because they are capable of coordinating an offense so effectively, that they are able to very consistently get good shooters open shots, in spots that they shoot particularly well from? That is a testament to their ability as a creator, not a detrimental attribute. || The irony about the ""one good month"" thing is that it's really one bad month that tricked people. He was All-NBA last year and will likely be again this year. He had a bad start to the year but is putting up historically efficient numbers. It's basically him and prime CP3 in terms of this combination of scoring and assist volume + efficiency. Nobody else in NBA history has done this. || It’s the same story around the current MVP debate. For a huge amount of NBA fans, box score is the only value you bring to a team. Offensive output, advanced metrics, film, team success, none of it matters compared to that box score that you can glance at for five seconds and determine how valuable a player is. || The reality is that Allen not being worthy of an all-star this year is mostly a numbers thing, getting four players in is pretty ridiculous given how much talent there is around the league. But having watched most of our games this year, I think it's debatable that he's even our fourth-best player, especially if you consider his defensive impact. He's also the type of player to be underrated by casual/occasional viewers, because he does a lot that doesn't show up on the scoreboard. || >but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context.

Do these metrics underrate these players or are you just over rating them? 

Harden, Herro, and Cade all have good advanced stats. They all carry fairly poor offences || Yes, the biggest reason for this is that none of these stats measure on-ball defensive attention drawn and the benefits that it leads to for other players on the team at the risk of deflating counting stats of the player drawing the attention.

Making open looks as the 3rd/4th option on your team and ending up with a high TS% does not make a player better than say a Cade Cunningham or Donovan Mitchell.

It’s similar to how Ayton had distinctly better advanced numbers than Luka in their rookie seasons along with strong box score numbers at incredible efficiency yet anyone watching knew he was Ayton was a play finisher role player on a fully firing suns team and Luka was the entire Mavs offence. || 2025 is certainly the year of our Lord Tyrone Jerome. || What makes Zubac a role player? He's averaging 17 and 13 playing 33 MPG while anchoring the Clippers' defense. He's contending for the most important player on the team right next to Harden and Kawhi. || > Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil. They’re useless.
> 
> 

Publicly available defensive metrics, absolutely. There's basically zero value in those.

Publicly available overall metrics are solid. The vast majority of basketball value comes from offense and we can measure most of that. It's imperfect, but it's a very good way to determine who's in the ballpark. || My understanding is a lot of these stats weigh a bunch of counting stats heavier for centers than other roles -- which is OK up to a point because maybe a center getting an assist is more valuable than a PG doing the same, but it's hard to know. PER people who know seem to generally perceive as antiquated, right? || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || As someone who doesn't watch much Indiana or Charlotte basketball,  I'm really curious how Haliburton and Ball compare now. And to a lesser extent, Ant.  
Thinking back, man, that was a really fun draft class. || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || It's so weird, he was an all-star and top-tier playmaker an entire year on the Pacers in 22-23 season. His second half of the season in 21-22, when he was traded to the Pacers, was also really really good. His shooting averages have been good his entire career. ""One good month"" people are trolls or need to have their eyes checked because all you need to do is watch 48 minutes of the Pacers and you'll see him constantly trapped and doubled _at the logo_ and instead of playing hero ball he swings it because someone will be open, whether it counts in his box score or not.

But it's no surprise, average basketball fans are really really stupid when it comes to elite playmakers. Jokic was clowned for years and now pretty much everyone recognize how incredible he is. I wonder, what is the difference between now and years before? Ring finger, that's it. || Wouldn't models that include plus/minus stats account for this? Even if you don't necessarily generate an assist or made shot, if your ""gravity"" is actually opening things for teammates and contributing to winning it will show up in the plus/minus.",0.0,0.652,0.348,0.5859,0.032,0.837,0.132,0.9987,0.097,0.711,0.192,0.9997

I decided to throw in Tyrese to see how he compares, even though he isn't really a favorite, because it's felt like he and the Pacers have made a weird amount of clutch plays recently. 

The Categories I'll be using:

**Clutch Time:** Just the basic NBA definition of clutch time, includes stats recorded with less than 5 minutes left in the 4th quarter or overtime with less than a 5 point differential between the two teams.

**End Game:** Similar to clutch time, but stats must be recorded with less than 1 minute on the clock with 5 point or less differential.

**Game on the line:** Stats recorded in final 30 seconds of the 4th quarter or overtime of 1 score games.

  
\* For this analysis I will mostly be using totals because per game metrics for seem a bit silly given the strict stipulations on the ""Final Minute"" and ""Game on the Line"" stats.

# Jalen Brunson:

**Clutch Time:** 

\- 145 total clutch points, on 52/31/84 shooting splits.

\- The Knicks haven't been in many ""clutch"" situations, but they have a very impressive 16-8 record in those games when Brunson plays

\- He has amassed 23 clutch assists the 3rd most of any award eligible player, while only turning the ball over in the clutch 7 times.

\- Played 117 clutch minutes.

**End Game:**

\- Tied with Trae for the most End Game points in the league with 54 with incredible 58/44/83 shooting splits making him by far the most efficient of the 20 highest scores in these scenarios

\- Only 2 assists and 3 turnovers

\- The Knicks are 14-7 with Brunson in End game scenarios

**Game On the Line:**

**-** Brunson leads all award eligible players in Game on the Line scoring with 32 points on 9/13 (63%) from the field and 3/5 (60%) from 3. He is also a perfect 11/11 from the free throw line in these high pressure moments

\- He is a ridiculous +20, tied for the highest of any non Pacer in these moments.

\- Brunson has turned the ball over twice with the game on the line

\- The Knicks have a 17-13 record in these situation with Brunson



# Nikola Jokic:

**Clutch Time:** 

\- 131 clutch points on an absurdly efficient 64% TS.

\- 2nd in clutch assists with 32, but he does have 13 clutch turnovers

\- The Nuggets are 17-13 in clutch games that Jokic appeared in

\- Has played 130 minutes of clutch time

**End Game:**

\- Jokic has 43 end game points, and his efficiency drops to only 46.4% from the field and 28.6% from 3.

\- He has 14 recorded end game rebounds, second most in the league and 8 end game assists, which is also the 2nd most in the league.

\- +12 +/- in end game scenarios

\- The Nuggets with Jokic are 15-10 in these End Game scenarios

**Game on the Line**

**-** Jokic has scored 25 Game on the line points, 3rd most of any award eligible player, shooting 7/15 (46%) from the field and 1 of 4 from 3.

\- Jokic has amassed 5 game on the line assists, 2nd most in the league

\- He leads the league in game on the line rebounding with 8

\- He is +12 leading the Nuggets to a 13-8 record in these scenarios and the 

# Trae Young:

**Clutch**

\- 152 total clutch points, the most of any player, but he has only shot 36% from the field and 33% from 3 during clutch time

\- 37 clutch assists, the most of any player

\- The Hawks are only 18-20 in clutch games with Trae

\- His totals are a bit padded compared to the others because he played 151 minutes of clutch basketball

**End Game:**

\- Tied with Brunson for the most end game points with 54, but he has actually shot very inefficiently making only 21.2% of his shots from the field and 15.8% from 3 in the end game. 

\- He has scored 37 out of his 47 end game free throw attempts so the vast majority of his end game points come from the line

\- He has a reasonably impressive 5 end game assist and 4 rebounds as well as 2 steals and a block

\- The Hawks are 16-17 in end game scenarios with Trae

**Game on the Line:**

\- Young has scored 28 game on the line points, the second most of any award eligible player

\- He has shot 5/16 (31%) from the field and 2/9 (22%) from 3 with the game on the line. However he is a very solid 16/18 (89%) from the line in the situations

\- Despite his Hawks being just 11-13 in Game on the Line scenarios, he individually is +8

 

# Anthony Edwards:

**Clutch**

\- He has 148 points, the 2nd most of any player 41/31/82 shooting split.

\- The Timberwolves are only 18-22 in clutch games he has appeared in

\- He has a 42 clutch rebounds, the 4th most in the NBA, and by far the most of any guard

\- He has more clutch time turnovers (14) than clutch assists (13)

\- Like Trae, his clutch time totals are a bit padded because he has played 154 clutch minutes

**End Game:**

\- He has amassed 39 end game points on 36/25/81 shooting splits

\- He has a shocking 1 end game assist to 6 end game turnovers

\- Anthony Edwards brought in 9 rebounds the most of any guard not named Josh Hart of Dyson Daniels

\- Anthony Edwards has a -16 +/- in end game scenarios, among of the worst in the league

\- The Timberwolves are 14-17 in end games that Anthony Edwards appears in

**Game On the Line**

\- Anthony Edwards has only amassed 16 points with the game on the line, shooting a terrible 4/15 (26%) from the field and 1/9 (11%) from 3 during those situations

\- It is worth noting that this season Anthony Edwards is perfect from the line shooting 7/7 in game on the line scenarios

\- He has yet to record a game on the line assist and has turned the ball over 3 times in those situations

\- Ant does have 2 game on the line blocks including a game winning block on SGA to complete a massive comeback on the road

# Tyrese Haliburton:

**Clutch**

\- Only 85 clutch points, on 48/41/78 splits

\- The Pacers are 17-12 in clutch games that Tyrese has appeared

\- Tyrese has only recorded 21 clutch assists, the 7th most in the league, but he has also only turned the ball over 5 times in the clutch

\- He has only recorded 107 minutes of Clutch Time, which definitely hampers his clutch totals

**End Game**

\- 38 end game points on a ridiculous a ridiculous 81.4% TS. His end game shooting splits are 62.5/60/80.

\- 6 end game assists, the 4th most in the league

\- He has a +15 +/- in the end game

\- The Pacers are 15-11 in end game scenarios with Haliburton

**Game on the Line:**

\- Haliburton has only scored 16 game on the line points, but he has done so only 5 felid goal attempts shooting a ridiculous 94% TS. He has as many ""And 1"" game winning three pointers as missed game on the line field goals.

\- Haliburton has missed a few free throws with the game on the line only going 5 of 8 from the strip.

\- The Pacers are 10-6 with Haliburton in Game on the Line Scenarios, and Haliburton himself is a very impressive +20



  
Conclusion:

Looking at the data for all three levels of clutch time, it seems pretty clear to me that Brunson is deserving of the award. Despite being in less clutch situations than many of the other candidates, he has amassed similar total stats on incredible efficiency in the biggest moments. Pretty much ever ""clutch"" game he has played in he has taken over down the stretch, and the Knicks have been highly successful in close games, largely due to Brunson. I would say that after Brunson, Jokic and Haliburton should be next in line. As he always is, Jokic has been incredibly well rounded doing a little bit of everything and being a great decision maker in the big moments. While partially due to missed time and partially due to the Pacers simply not having a lot of close games early in the season, Haliburton hasn't racked up quite as many points or assists in the big moments as some of the other guys have, but he has still been incredibly clutch scoring at a freakish rate and pulling off a few special moments. Honestly, it doesn't really seem to me that Trae or Anthony Edwards have been particularly ""clutch"" this season. While technically they have scored the most clutch time points, they have been very inefficient, and their inefficiencies have only increased in the highest stake moments. In particular, it seems Anthony Edwards has also been shockingly turnover prone and has played a bit to much hero ball in clutch moments, which has really hurt the Timberwolves and caused them to lose a few more games than they otherwise would. Perhaps with both Trae and Anthony Edwards that inefficiency in clutch time, can at least partially be explained by a lack of teammates who are capable of taking over in clutch time which would prevent defenses from focusing on stopping them so much. I would love to here y'alls thoughts on the matter 

  
**Random Fun or Interesting Notes I learned while making this:**

\- Although Maxey isn't eligible for the award because he has missed to many games he actually leads the league in Game on the Lin scoring with 35 points

\- The 3 players with the highest +/- in Game on the line moments are Siakam, Nesmith, and Nembhard all of whom are Indiana Pacers players

\- James Harden has by far the most clutch turnovers with 24, and has shot just 30% from the the field and 11% from 3 in the clutch.

\- Cade Cunningham has the most end game blocks of any player in the league ",93,23,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jr2sqp/breaking_down_clutch_player_of_the_year_candidates/,2025-04-03 23:52:00,"Knicks have one of the best OT records in the league at 6-1 and a large part of that is due to Brunson. Obviously this isn't counting non OT matches but he's really been elite in these moments, he has my vote. || Cade jumpscare at the end. While I can remember some highlight blocks at the end of games this season, I would have assumed a center would be leading in that stat. || It's definitely Darius Garland. He's top 10 in clutch pts for 1 of the best teams in the league. Or Brunson, he's got the most per game & total. || I believe the last 2 clutch player of the year had the most total clutch points. This makes me think Trae or Ant will end up winning considering Brunson is still out || My favorite part of award season is seeing the new and impressive reasons people come up with to explain why Hawks players actually don’t deserve the award they lead the stats in || [removed] || This + the fact brunson was also a candidate last year


hes proven it over two years now that hes insanely clutch giving it to someone else would just further the idea that these charity awards/in-season tournament are fucking useless garbage || [removed] || Garland is kind of in the same boat as Halliburton where he would probably be a serious contender if he was in more clutch situations. He’s scored really well and hardly turned the ball over, but since the Cavs haven’t had many truly close games he has only play 102 total clutch minutes and hasn’t really had any super memorable clutch plays this season

Edit: never mind Garland is him || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || Garland doesn’t have as much clutch opportunities, but when he has, he has absolutely shined.

Shooting splits: 56/56/87, 73 TS%

He’s doing it on 28% usage, with almost 20 assist rating and just 4 turnovers to 6 steals total. Over 30 net rating.

The only possible knock on Garland is that while he has absolutely been the most clutch player in the limited opportunities he gets, he also owns one of the most un-clutch moments of the season. After a flagrant foul at the end of the Rockets game, he missed free throws that would have won the game. Wild considering he was over 90% from the line at the time.

I would like to think that could be overlooked considering how otherworldly he has been in the rest of his minutes, but others may not. || He literally hit a game winning half court buzzer beater this season || Does that mean you would change your pick from Brunson to Garland or just that he should have been included in your post? || Love the edit. Lmao || I remember watching that game and thinking he might have lost his clutch poty contention with that one game. || Did he actually? What game was that? || In Detroit about 2 months ago. Cavs nearly blew a 10 point lead in the last minute and then Garland saved it with this shot

#Conclusion

Usually the 3-6 and 4-5 matchups are the best series to watch in the first round of the playoffs.

Each team has an all star(s) and talent throughout the roster.

Which series will be the most compelling?

Plus the 3-6 and 4-5 series in the east. This is the kind of parity people were clamoring for during the Cavs/Warriors era of the 2010s, I hope all my fellow NBA nerds are enjoying it as much as I am || Nuggets Clippers. The hottest team coming into the playoffs vs the team that reset itself middle of this week but has Jokic. Nuggets vibe is actually looking good, but Clippers are coming in very hot, and Zubac gives Jokic trouble. Jamal looked good the past two games. AG is on fire and looks healthy for once. Kawhi has ice running through his veins right now. Harden's gonna Harden, Russ is gonna Russ. || Honestly, Nuggets vs. Clippers looks promising. It will be a hard battle. However, I wouldn't count out the Pistons 👀 || I might be biased as a Bucks fan, but I think that Bucks/Pacers has the potential to be incredibly entertaining - the crowds will probably be nuts, and there’s a ton of bad blood between the teams and the players will likely get super heated during the games. And they’ve been pretty competitive with each other since last playoffs through now. || Nuggets Clippers is going to be fascinating to watch. Probably the most entertaining. The other 3 series will be entertaining as well though. Knicks Pistons is going to be interesting to watch. Thibs could be in trouble if the Knicks lose. || Since no one else is saying it, Lakers v Wolves.

A lot of people seem to be writing off the wolves offense but wolves 4th highest offense since the allstar break, 8th for the whole year (from cleaningtheglass). They've been really good and they've been moving the ball effectively. That's way better than last year, think they were around 15th. With the wolves size, I think they'll give LA a lot of issues. 

On the other end, the lakers small ball lineup will cook i'm sure but the wolves have a lot of good perimeter defenders to throw at them to slow them down. Finch has also been willing to bench Rudy for Naz even in crunch time, if things are going poorly.

Overall, think it will be a close matchup. || There's quite a few legitimate title contenders and a few dark horses that could have a shot if the cards fall right, as is with any pro sports you need a bit of luck to win a championship. 

I've been really looking forward to this post season as it is no longer a 2-4 horse race anymore. The NBA hasn't been this interesting in decades in terms of the amount of potential outcomes at the endgame. || Bucks-Pacers is probably the closest to a rivalry considering those matchups always get super salty for some reason. Hoping that one is as exciting as it seems || A lot of people think the pistons and knicks series will be competitive. But outside of cade who can u rely on for offense on the pistons? I think the knicks will blitz cade and force others to make shots || in my opinion i think the T-Wolves can really make that Lakers series interesting if Ant and Randle play well, either that or the Bucks/Pacers series are going to be the most competitive and best watches for round 1 || western conference is going to be so much fun to watch imo. That denver/clippers series might go to 7 games.

i’m a lebron fan but i also see the wolves giving them hell if they aren’t careful too. Can’t wait to watch || I think that Twolves-Lakers series is gonna be exciting. I would probably put my money on the Lakers if i was a betting man but i will not be surprised if the Twolves come with their A game and take it in 7 || I'm not too fussed by the eastern conference; it feels like a Cavs/Celtics ECF is inevitable with the Celtics most likely winning it. The 3-6/4-5 matchups are interesting for sure, but I feel like whoever wins them is just going to get stomped on in the next round either way. I'll probably tune in for the ECF but otherwise I'm gonna pass on most games I think. 

The western conference, on the other hand, looks to be super competitive. OKC is the only team that I'm fairly certain will make it out of the first round. For Nuggets vs Clippers I'd favor the nuggets generally, but they just fired their head coach so who knows how they'll play. Lakers/Timberwolves is a marquee matchup and will probably be the most entertaining 1st round series to watch. || I'm a little disappointed in the West, I was realllly hoping for Lakers v Warriors and Nuggets v T'Wolves || [deleted] || Easily nuggets/clippers.


Jokic could very plausibly be going out in the first round. Regardless, the Nuggets should be blown up. || Pacers Bucks to me is the one I have the most trouble picking which I think will win. The Pacers were the team I most wanted on the opposite side of the bracket (from the Celtics), but that was because of matchups, with both the Celtics and Cavs. But I think the matchup is more neutral against the Bucks, and the Bucks are probably the better team still, so I'm leaning Bucks in a good series. || If the Clippers win against the Nuggets I'm rooting for them the whole way. Would actualy be epic. || Knicks pistons because of how tough pistons defense and how awful some of thibs set. It will be competitive bcoz of the rough, grinding style of play. || Knicks pistons is going to be a slow paced slug fest and it’s going to be beautiful.

Bucks and Pacers is interesting. Pacers fast pace should theoretically dismantle the bucks since their system is very slow paced. However Giannis excels in fast paced systems but Brook will not be able to keep up.

IMO Timberwolves will get dismantled unless they can take advantage of the size advantage in the paint.

Clippers Nuggets imo will be a fun watch. A very slow paced game but with the opportunity to see great defensive schemes || This reads like someone went into ChatGPT and had it analyze each of these matchups. Low quality post - I expected better from this sub. || Knicks pistons is gonna great.


Jokic Probably leaving after this summer because clips might gentlemen sweep || The only one that’s NOT is Knicks/Pistons. The other 3 are going to be great series. || Last 5 years have had different champions. 2 had never won and the bucks had a very long drought. This is the most parity I ever remember in the last 25 years || OKC vs the 8 seed (assuming GSW wins the play-in for 7) is not going to be particularly interesting.  It will be a slaughter. Despite the win total, Memphis ""feels"" closer to a middling .500ish team in terms of the level of challenge they will present to any opponent in the playoffs.

In R2 either the Clippers or Nuggets will be too gassed to do much vs OKC as well.

I expect 3 good first-round series in the West, 1 good 2nd round, and a walkover in the WCF (OKC will be fresh and rested vs whoever comes out of the 2-3-6-7 side).

EC is the one that gets more interesting each round. || Same thing is said every year, yet last year neither conference finals and the finals were not competitive. That's not parity. || Thanks for talking about AG. He’s been amazing past few weeks and national media completely glosses him over and forget he’s on the team. Here way more about Westbrook than AG or Braun || Honestly I could see this being very competitive, or I could see the Clippers making short work of the Nuggets. I’m not sure I see the Nuggets making short work of the Clippers. || Nuggets defense is (still) just so bad, I struggle to see them being that competitive. Their offense could win them a few games, but Clippers are looking really good. || I don't see it. This relies on Murray being consistent for an entire playoff series and dude is coming of a minor injury not playing for 2 weeks. He then comes back and plays about 50 mins of basketball for 2 games with another 1 week layoff means he's going to be quite rusty for playoff basketball.",0.0,0.858,0.142,0.2484,0.062,0.806,0.132,0.9925,0.057,0.733,0.209,0.9998
