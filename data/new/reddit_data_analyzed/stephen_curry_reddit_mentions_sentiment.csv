Let’s compare a random year to last one.

Avg NBA player age in 1980 - 26.5.

Avg NBA player age in 2024 - 26.2

Age of the Top 5 MVP vote-getters?

33, 29, 27, 23, 31 in 1980.

28, 25, 24, 29, 27 in 2024.

The oldest player to ever win a finals MVP remains Kareem (at 38), who was a perennial Top 5 player in his 30’s. Incidentally he was 1980’s MVP, at 33 (his 6th).

The leading rebounder in the league was 30. Larry Bird was the only member of the first team All-NBA team younger than 28.

Triple-slash lines are better in part because of offensive inflation, which gives the illusion that the likes of KD are “aging more gracefully,” but impact metrics rightly point out he’s actually declined quite severely! 

 Basketball is still, by and large, a young man’s sport, but there will always be outliers. There’s just little evidence to suggest there are way more of them now. 

Durant is 36 as we speak — Karl Malone finished 1st, 4th and 7th in his Age 35-37 years in MVP voting. 

Curry is 36 going on 37….at 35, Michael Jordan retired as the best player in basketball. Stockton, part of the same generation, was all-NBA at 36, an all-star at 37. He missed 22 games in 19 seasons.

LeBron is 39. He’s an outlier, but at 39 Kareem was still a deserving all-star, the second best player on a title-winning team. He was Top 10 in MVP voting in his first 17 years; LeBron, meanwhile, has “only” been Top 10 14 times.

The sport is a little friendlier to aging now, at best. Not a lot.

The advancements in sports medicine are countered by the extra rigours of todays game (according to tracking data, players are running increasingly more now). On the whole, things about even out. 

Basketball is very very very clearly not much older now. That could change, but we’ve jumped the gun here. 


If I am wrong, please give me evidence to the contrary. Or, if you think I’m cherry-picking, provide me with a less cherry-picked range/reference point.

This feels quite cherry picked to prove a point. Without more data points, I don't think your conclusion is proved. || you have to look at Kareem and Malone who are also known to have elite longetivity to just compare guys this year. 

Id say go to 1980-2010 and look at the 35-39 yrs old ""per year"" (not consolidate everyone's elite for each year then compare it to just 2024 like this post) production and TS relative to competition. how many are still number 1 & 2 options. || I mean, I remember I saw [this a couple years ago](https://weaksideawareness.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/average-nba-career-length-for-players-details/) and I don't think much has changed.   
 
Also in regards to your ""average age"" comment, just a small tidbit, it helps to discuss it relative to usage. Example: By raw age, the Lakers are the 16th oldest team in the NBA. However, they're the 3rd oldest when sorted by average age among players who get usage.  
   
[There was also a study done from the Macalester Review](https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1032&context=macreview) which showed that players who won accolades often had far longer careers than those who didn't. Just some more things for people to look at. || I think people are just being appreciative. Reddit users' age is also a factor, as they witnessed the transition between eras. We won't be able to know which era will age well, but LeBron is showing us something never before done. || The idea that players last longer now is ridiculous.  Players play fewer minutes per career now than ever before in all major sports. || That's the wrong way to go about this analysis. Compare how many 30+ year olds are scoring in the 20s or have PERs above league average or something like that, then you'd have a better understanding || what's the average age of rookie players in recent years vs back then? I'm guessing that plays a part on the insignificant difference in average age || OP, I’d just like to commend you for a very interesting post that has clearly hit a button with posters here. I think it’s interesting that everyone seems to be piling on you and shooting you down from the get go, often engaging in the exact same fallacious reasoning that they’re accusing you of engaging in. 

For example, some people are accusing you of starting with your premise and then attempting to work backwards to prove it, even though almost everyone here seems to have a baseline assumption that you’re wrong. Others are demanding you perform quite a bit of extra work to prove your point, even though they themselves are doing no work whatsoever to arrive at their own points. And yet others are accusing you of setting up a straw-man that nobody actually believes, even though the vast majority of comments *in this very post* prove that most people do in fact believe it!

I do wish more people would respond a bit more productively with your admittedly casual and offhand observation and quickly gathered data point. I’m going to admit that I’ve had a hunch modern sports science has been overblown. At the end of the day rest is still the primary means of recuperation for most injuries, just like in the past. This isn’t the end all of the matter, but it’s a solid contribution. || Average age isn't the only factor in longevity.

It's also NBA mileage which is also lots of wear and tear. 

This means guys with full 4 year college degrees and years lost due to injury (or retirement) ends up prolonging the age in which players are dominant.

Kareem stopped being a top dominant superstar in 1982 at the age of 34 which is his 12th season. 

Michael Jordan took 2 years off, had one year injured, and when he retired the second time at age 34 he'd only played 11 full seasons. 

Karl Malone appears to be the actual exception of older players.

Steph Curry and KD have played the equivalent of 13 and 14/15 full seasons. Steph appears to have tailored off but KD is going strong. One who isn't talked about is Kobe. He was a top level player at age 34 but that was his 17th season before it was derailed by the Achilles injury. || You could make an argument that players play longer because nba players rarely have 4 years of college experience while 3-4 years were the norm back then. || I think it’s overblown solely by the fact we haven’t really seen it yet. I see a lot of comments about how some players will age gracefully but they aren’t even 30 yet. How do you figure that? LeBron, KD, Steph yea. Who else? This conversation only tookoff after they got older. Some guys may be better older than players of the past but can still be very different from their prime feats. All the talk about sports medicine yet we have discussions about players getting hurt more often. If Giannis, jokic, Tatum, ant, Wemby can become 37 year old all stars maybe we can be on to something. As it stands right now I see a bunch of outliers like we always get and some stars that may be older and productive, but def not as good as they once were. We’re already seeing a handful of injury prone young stars as it is. || i spend multiple hours a day every single day consuming basketball content. huge hobby / passion of mine. i don’t know if i’ve ever seen someone say this.

you sure you aren’t just making this narrative up in your head? i’m sure it’s been said before, but “vastly overblown” is hilarious. || I’m not gonna engage in this debate primarily because I don’t have the research to - that being said, you are looking at the data from a very limited and skewed place. 

What’s the average length of an nba career 1980 vs now? What’s the median? At what age do players retire on at average in the 80s vs 2020? To what degree does the nba having so many more players impact the numbers now? 


Like if I were to guess, I would guess that players retire when they’re older now on a longer nba career - but I don’t have the data for that nor does any of your data address that || Are actually trying to disregard the huge leapt that sports science has taken taken in the last 2 decades, bc thats what it looks like. 

You should maybe look into Criatiano Ronaldo, Messi, how much Lebron spends monthly on “his body”, CP3’s diet. Carvajal from RM is on a gluten diet too and suddenly became the best RB in the world last season. How any sport changes has very little to do in comparison with how prepared physicist, doctors, nutritionist are prepared nowadays.

Theres so much resources about it and you are hand picking stats lmfao

Edit: the latest news suggests they can fix some knee issues without surgery || No one thinks that players are lasting longer now. so youre going against a strawman who very few people agree with. the biggest issue is talent and athleticism threshold in the league is extremely high now than a generation ago. guys like robert parish and kevin willis can play well into their 40s not only because of the slower pace, but less competition to get into the league. no g league or international leagues that had players ready to take their spots, only the draft. guys like carmelo, dwight and boogie couldve played longer a generation ago but there is just way too much competition in roster spots that theres no room.   || But what’s the age of the average starter? Young guys go in and out of the league more often now || I think there was a point in the 2000s where a lot of great players flamed out or became washed early and young people just assumed that was always happening in the NBA. Many great players were asked to carry mid teams in the 2000s and the load was too much for them to make it to the 36-39 year range. Just off the top of my head

Tmac

Brandon Roy

Yao Ming

Shaq

AI

Amare stoudamire

Gilbert Arenas

Dwight

Elton Brand

Rasheed Wallace

Deron Williams

Ben Wallace

A huge portion of stars in the 2000s who were either out of the league or putting up triple singles by 36 years old. || Don’t forget Mike Conley, Al Horford, James Harden, Draymond Green, DeMar DeRozan, Jrue Holiday, Chris Paul, and more. The longevity rn is insane || The elite players are for sure playing at elite levels a lot longer. Duncan was pretty much finished being a MVP level player by the time he was in his mid 30s. Kobe was done in his mid 30s. AI was done in his mid 30s, etc. || There were 2 players who were younger than 22 in the NBA in 1980, which was .05% of the league. In 2024 there are 70, which is 13.5% of the league. Don’t you think your average age numbers are skewed by this a bit?

In 1980, 53 players were over 30, which was 14.8% of the league. 3 of them were over 34, none of them were over 36 and none of those players were starters. In 2024, there are 100 players over 30, which is 19.3% of the league. 23 of them are older than 34. 10 of them are over 36. Half of that 10 are still playing significant minutes. All of those 5 players are starters or have started a majority of their games.

I think you’re actually just dead wrong on this one. || Guys were also playing long college careers and entering the league a few years older whereas today they're coming out a lot earlier which will increase the average. || 
Fair enough. It’s not cherry-picked — believe it or not I copy-pasted the ‘80 data from a convo elsewhere where the person I was conversing with brought up 1980 as the converse to today’s “older sport.” 

Which years would you like me to compare? Pick some at random so that you know I’m not cherry-picking (indeed, *you* can even cherry-pick and I’ll be none-the-wiser) then give me your parameters and I’ll follow them.

Edit: what is downvotable about this comment? I’m literally asking the person to give me a range of years that they think are fairer, and I will dutifully compare them. || And also, yes, Kareem was a total freak. As is Lebron. But that doesn't suggest anything about *trends*. 


Has there ever been a time where so many older players were still so good? Because that's what meant by ""players lasting longer now"" - not just a comparison of the handful of freakiest of freaks. || Actually the average rookie was way older in 1980, so it actually does show that more vets hold on for longer careers. Always funny when an innumerate person butchers a stat that ends up demonstrating the opposite of what they were trying to prove. || Thank you, excellent resources. I’ll take a closer look at the study tonight. || Nah, Not only were Malone and KAJ playing at all star levels they averaged 75+ games played per season in their 35-40 seasons vs Lebron’s 55+ games played || Good point. A mix of sentimentality and recency bias might be one of the drivers here. || I think the truth is somewhere in the middle, and depends on the sport we’re discussing.  

For basketball, the data I’ve seen suggests that:

a) players do indeed play less minutes, like you point out. 

b) the game is probably a little more taxing on a per-minute basis, according to tracking data which reveals players run more.

c) the top-performers and age of the average player has remained stable. 


In a sport like, say, tennis, both the top performers AND average player is a little older now than the last couple of generations preceding today. I go into some detail as to why I think that is, elsewhere:

*I think consistency at the top will follow from the conditions of the tour becoming more consistent. This is why I believe the 70’s-90’s players are a little underrated historically.*

*A snapshot of the tour in the 90’s: all four majors played much differently, carpet was a big part of the season, GS tournies had only 16 seeds (and no retractable roofs + Super Saturday at the US Open). If one were to go out of their way to engineer conditions that would make the tour maximally difficult for any one style of play to master, would it look much different than that? Even the two MOST similar majors (AO and USO) were plenty different. Incidentally, it was Hewitt that endlessly moaned about the stickiness of Rebound Ace, and he wasn’t alone there.*

*Ffw’d to today: carpet has been abolished, replaced by indoor HC (the presence of which has shrunk following Madrid getting moved to clay and replaced by an outdoor HC) and top players (understandably, from a commercial perspective) are constantly catered to. The blue clay experiment lasted all of one tournament and promptly switched back to the red stuff after Nadal and Djokovic threatened to boycott, the ex-tourney director of the Paris Masters admits the courts were slowed down to attract Federer, RA was replaced by the more sterile Plexi, and so on.*

*But all of this, heterodox as it is for someone on my side of the aisle to say, is still a little overblown. It wasn’t JUST the variety of the tour that prevented someone like, say, Sampras from performing better on clay or slower HC. Would playing with poly give his serve a big boost today? Hell yes. But he’d also have challenges competing in a more physical tour given his thalassemia, he had difficulty sliding on clay, and the backhand would have to be re-tooled.*


*No, forget for a moment surfaces, balls and tournament directors. To me what hurts the 70’s-90’s guys more, from a longevity/consistency perspective, is just how often the meta changed following the two main inflection points of the last 40 years: the emergence of graphite, and the emergence of poly. Try imagining playing your entire life with woodies and then basically having to risk uprooting your swing mechanics on a dime to stay competitive. That led to some turnover at the top. McEnroe, while undoubtedly hurt by his personal goings-on, found himself getting consistently overpowered and unable to keep up by the time he reached his mid-to-late 20’s. Was it on him to adapt? Ostensibly, yes, but that’s a pretty big mountain to climb, no? Just as it would be if graphite were banned in the mid-2010’s and Nadal’s results consequently nosedived. Picture the uproar here lol.*

*Borg, while he quit the game early, also would’ve had to adapt, as his hybrid backhand was suboptimal even for the early power-baselining days.*

*Even Lendl, whose skillset suited graphite and was a model of consistency, ran into a wall in his late 20’s and went through his own “late-20’s McEnroe” phase of getting overpowered by the two early forerunners of the power S+V game: Becker and, to a lesser extent, Sampras. Becker being the first player of that mould really benefitted him on the come-up (hard to see him winning Wimby at 17 otherwise), but even he wasn’t spared as Sampras eventually came along and did the same things, only much better. This extreme aggression, willed into existence by conditions which incentivized them, brought them glory on fast courts but appropriately did not work one iota on clay.*

*Then, as the paradigm was finally starting to stabilize in the mid-to-late-90’s, poly comes in and throws a wrench into things, enabling a level of spin production and shot tolerance (particularly defensive shot tolerance) that was theretofore impossible and reducing the viability of almost every style of play except for strict offensive baselining. That hurt Sampras and the late-70’s born players (I don’t think it’s entirely coincidental that the ‘75-‘80 era is one of the more useless in tennis history), Hewitt and others.*


**Importantly, the second-most longevous period in tennis history—the one that had their own versoin of The Big 3, that played amazing tennis up to their late 30’s and early 40’s—doubled as the most condition-stable one!! Yes, that’s right: aging distributions from the ‘50’s to the mid 70’s pretty much mirror the one’s today!**

*This all might sound like the tennis equivalent of a just-so story (and I admit I am condensing the full story into bite-sized narratives, because frankly there aren’t enough hours in a day) but they sum up why I think longevity was hard to come by from the late 70’s to the early 2000’s. Fans assume that today’s age distributions are abnormal (and sure, at the VERY top they might be)...but the expectation that we had in the aughts for tennis players to start carrying canes in their late 20’s is distinctly ahistorical. It’s one of the driving forces for why many intelligent people assumed Fed and Nadal (spesh the latter) wouldn’t hack it once they reached 30.*


TL;DR - depends on the sport, depends on what we’re looking at. 

 Nonetheless, we probably have a big overlap in opinion here. || Definitely not in world football  || Yes but basketball is also played at a pace much faster than it was in the 90s and early 2000s. We’ve gone from 90 possessions per game to 100. Players today have to cover more ground and fight through more off ball actions than in years past. To me it’s pretty damn impressive to see guys in their late 30s running around at the pace the game is played today",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.042,0.85,0.108,0.9775,0.054,0.824,0.122,0.9997
Stephen Curry,"""Stephen Curry"" OR ""Chef Curry"" OR ""Steph"" OR ""Curry"" OR ""Stephen""",2024-12-28,nbadiscussion,1hogf1q,Mock Early All-Star Rosters,"I was thinking today about how stacked the league is in terms of individual talent, and how there will be quite a few guys getting snubbed from the all-star rosters this year.

I tried to put together some early rosters based on my opinions and my estimates of how voting will go. I'll also include some notable snubs.

East:

G: **Jalen Brunson** - Bonafide superstar after last year with the New York market to back him up.

G: **Donovan Mitchell**- Best offensive player/most marketable player on a team on pace for 70+ wins.

F: **Jayson Tatum** - Known commodity having an excellent season

F: **Giannis Antetokounmpo** - Superstar arguably having his best individual season, likely best player in the east, leads the league in scoring and Bucks are hot.

C: **Karl Anthony-Towns** - With Embiid being in and out of the lineup KAT is likely the best center in the east, and he's been playing amazing as he meshes into new surroundings. Also has the New York Market.

B1: **Damian Lillard** - Popular vet having a great season.

B2: **Jaylen Brown** - Last year's Finals MVP who will lose his shit if he gets snubbed again after the Olympics.

B3: **Trae Young** - Trae is back to proper All-Star form after a few down years missing the weekend.

B4: **Evan Mobley** - Young big who has made the leap into a versatile legit weapon on both ends.

B5: **LaMelo Ball** - Honestly I'm not too sure about this one, he's averaging thirty but he is typically made out of glass so I think it will depend on how many games he plays in the coming weeks.

B6: **Cade Cunningham** - Young budding star with great counting stats and who's impressive maturity has helped turn Detroit around immensely.

B7: **Darius Garland** Great player on a team that I think deserves to get three guys into the game.

**EASTERN SNUBS** (in no particular order)

Mikal Bridges, 
OG Anunoby,
Jarrett Allen,
Scottie Barnes,
Derrick White,
RJ Barrett,
Scottie Barnes,
Tyrese Maxey,
Josh Hart,
Jalen Johnson,
Bam Adebayo,
Tyler Herro,
Tyrese Haliburton,
Pascal Siakam,
Jimmy Butler,
Brandon Miller,
Joel Embiid (Injured)
Paolo Banchero (Injured)
Franz Wagner (Injured)

I'd probably put Tyrese Maxey, Derrick White, RJ Barrett, Jarrett Allen, Jalen Johnson and Tyler Herro first up for injury reserves.

**WEST:**

G: **Shai-Gilgeous Alexander** - On here for obvious reasons

G: **Luka Doncic** - See above

F: **LeBron James** - Ah, this is a tricky one. Obviously fucking LeBron James will be an all-star game starter. And is he an all-star caliber player? Yes. Does every all-star caliber player get to be in the all-star game in the year 2024? No. Does LeBron objectively deserve to be an all-star starter this year? Probably not.

F: **Victor Wembanyama** - Everyone knew it was only a matter of time before this guy was at the very top of the league in terms of production, and here we are.

F: **Nikola Jokic** - An absurd basketball player

B1: **Anthony Davis** - The Lakers have a lot of problems, and Anthony Davis is only one of them sometimes. One of the biggest names in the league, he will be in the All-Star game.

B2: **Anthony Edwards** - Edwards has had a... weird season thus far. He has all but abandoned his athletic interior game to chick up threes on ridiculous efficiency. But is that what the Wolves need from him? Probably not. He will also be in the All-Star game.

B3: **Jaren Jackson Jr** - The Memphis Grizzlies are second in the West, so naturally I hear nothing about them ever. I was surprised to see that Jackson Jr. is their leading scorer. Maybe a Memphis fan can explain their success despite Ja and Bane having down years statistically. (Especially Bane, wtf is happening there?)

B4: **Kevin Durant** - Kevin Durant will be in the NBA All-Star game

B5: **Stephen Curry** - I honestly don't believe Curry deserves a spot this year, but see my entries for KD and Bron for an explanation.

B6: **Alperen Sengun** - Sengun is probably having a worse individual year than last year when at time she was heralded as the second coming of Jokic, but the Rockets have shot right to the top of the West this year and need a guy in the big game. I figure it should be Sengun, but again I literally never hear anything about the Rockets outside of Reddit and am not totally sure who their main guy is considering it seems that they have pretty consistent production across the roster and their top scorer Jalen Green is still the proto-type of AAU ball.

B7: **Kyrie Irving** - The last spot in the West was a tough decision. I gave it to Kyrie because he is having a great year, the Mavs are near the top of the West, he's coming off of a high publicity playoff run, and he is a known commodity in the league.

**WESTERN SNUBS** (in no particular order)

Norman Powell,
James Harden,
Jalen Williams,
Devin Booker,
Ja Morant,
De'Aaron Fox,
Domantas Sabonis,
Jalen Green,
Trey Murphy III,
Dejounte Murray,
Rudy Gobert,
Julius Randle,
Brandon Ingram,
Chet Holmgren (Injured)
Zion Williamson (Injured)

I'd probably put Jalen Williams, James Harden, Devin Booker, Ja Morant and De'Aaron Fox up first for injury reserves. Frankly I would put any of these guys in over Curry but I know that's not going to happen.

If you read this far congratulations. This has been a nice way to spend an hour. Let me know what your thoughts are.",95,60,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hogf1q/mock_early_allstar_rosters/,2024-12-28 16:57:33,"I'm really nibbling at the edges here, but snubs implies that they're having a great season and maybe only barely miss out on a spot. It doesn't mean a known good player who's scoring 20 a game or some prior All-Star. Maybe they're honorable mentions or sub All-Stars (a concept from Thinking Basketball), but they're not snubs.


For instance, I find it difficult to believe that the Pelicans get 4 players in the snub category with the worst record in the West. Green, Randle, and Gobert (as much as I liked his contributions with us) are not snubs either. 


Similar for the East. || Anthony Edwards is shooting 3s this season because the starting line up has Gobert, McDaniels, and Randle who all do not give him spacing to play an interior game. || I really agree with these. It's hard to get new blood in the game with all the legacy/ large market picks but that's just part of it for now. 

As a Grizzlies fan, Bane had an oblique injury early in the season and he just now seems to be shaking the rust off. Combine that with playing fewer minutes by design with a deep bench and his numbers are down. I'm not concerned. || I can explain the Memphis situation. JJJ massively improved when he was the only one healthy last season playing with literal G league players as his starting teammates. Ja keeps getting hurt every three games so he has missed a lot and is trying to focus on assisting more. Bane got an injury early season and is just now getting back to form. He was pretty bad for a while though. The Grizzlies are doing so well because during the offseason they fired almost all of the assistant coaches and brought in a ton of new ones. The new offense is all about sharing the ball and playing with the fastest pace in the NBA. Most games even the starters play under 30min because the philosophy is to always have fresh guys in the game. So far the Grizzlies have the best bench in the league and that’s why they keep winning even though Ja and Bane haven’t been at their best. Also drafting two rookies who are top 5 helps. Oh yeah and GG and Vince still haven’t even played yet. (Vince played two games but I’m not counting that.) || If you think Curry doesn’t deserve an Allstar nod this year, I will agree on that. But Allstar game is in San Francisco, his home turf. Plus, he is like top 2 in terms of popularity so I think he will still be an Allstar even though he is regressing. || Jalen Williams has to be in there, OKC are miles ahead in the West and deserve at least 2 All-Stars (and if Chet wasn't injured you could even make a case for 3 All-stars) || I think your East is probably close to what it will be (some of it is easy to predict – the East starters are already pretty much locked up). However, I think it will Herro instead of LaMelo. Coaches reward winning with the reserves. Heat are sixth right now, Hornets thirteenth. Heat will have someone. Bam is having a down year and there’s no way coaches reward Jimmy for whatever is going on with him. And Herro has been great. He’s having a crazy efficient year and has been good enough to deserve it. || I think your east lineup is great. I think Herro might sneak in, but that’s it. 

In the west, I think Harden should be an absolute lock, but because of politics he might miss it. He’s better than Sengun and Kai. Imo Sabonis, Fox, and maybe Book and JDub have also been better than those two. || Harden deserves it. I don’t think Dallas should have 2 all stars. Luka might miss it depending on the severity of his injury. 

As for the East, I don’t think Cleveland will get 3 all stars. I think Hali or Maxey gets in instead of Garland. || Sengun inclusion by a non biased Rockets fan is great to see. His game isn’t as flashy because of the Udokas system, but he’s way more effective overall which has contributed to team success. || Nice breakdown…pretty darn accurate…definitely hope Melo plays the rest of the games till ASG…he’s a joy to watch, makes me chuckle how much fun he’s having 🕊 || Agree with all except for Kyrie, I think JDub and Harden deserve it more than he does rn given that the league normally awards the top teams two all stars like last year with KAT and Ant and that a surprising team like the Clips would normally have an all star especially one thats a house hold name. 

Though I do not hate the selection and understand your reasoning for that || Focused mostly on your East lineup as I’m a Sixers homer. 

Lamelo entertaining AF and has played 22 games, def would keep him in.

I take the all star as popularity / the current season. So don’t care that Brown was finals MVP or would be upset, he’s on outside of the fence for me 

Josh hart as a snub what? 

I’d get Maxey in the mix - otherwise generally like the work (once again, am homer) || LaMelo is not an All-Star!! His team is 7-24. This is the Bradley Beal 2020 situation. 30 PPG on a bottom feeder on bad efficiency is not All-Star worthy. Also noteworthy that Beal shot 45% from the field and LaMelo is shooting 42%. Empty stats. || I agree on all of the above. My heart tells me that Lebron and Durant should be swapped, but I know that is unlikely.

Frankly, I'm more inclined to agree with Bill Simmons and Kirk Goldsberry who posit that the game is in a good place right now and that a lot of the discourse about the state of the game relies on a lot of bias that views the Jordan-era style through rose-colored lenses. To summarize, they agree that Bulls vs. Knicks/Magic/Sonics at the time were awesome games, games like Warriors/Nuggets, Mavericks/Wizards, etc. were exceptionally bad, and that the overall baseline of game quality is much higher now than it was back then. This is an argument I overall agree with, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement. 

Here's a list of my suggestions, many of which I think would be unrealistic for pragmatic reasons:

1) **Less timeouts.** You should expect an average game to last about 2x the amount of game time (5 timeouts in total). In FIBA, 40 minutes (4 10-min quarters) and games typically last about 80-90 minutes. Following that rule, NBA games should last close to 100 minutes. Instead, the average NBA game runs about 135 minutes ([source](https://thebruinsblog.net/average-nba-game-length/)). Part of what I love about the FIBA/Olympic games is there was a better flow because there were less momentum-stopping timeouts. I guess they already reduced the number of timeouts from 18 to 14 about 8 years ago, but the mandatory TV timeouts still suck the life out of the game. However, since less timeouts means less commercials which means less ad revenue, I doubt they will ever go much lower.

2) **Allow more perimeter defense.** Creating a 4-point arc isn't going to fix the root of the problem. Instead, we need to allow more contact on the perimeter. While I'm not advocating for a return to the grind-out years of the early-aughts between the likes of the Pistons and Spurs, I think part of the root of the too-many-3s criticism is the fact that we've discouraged players from defending the ball farther out from the hoop. We generally agree that picking up a foul 25 feet from the hoop is kind of a bad idea, but that means, as a result, the defender doesn't pick up their man until their 22 feet from the hoop, so it's hard to fault a player from shooting with that kind of space, especially if you're a guy like Curry, Young, Lillard, etc. 

3) **Stop bailing out bump finishes.** This one is particularly hard to administer because it's a hard differentiation for the refs. But, with the bump finish now being a coached and drilled move, refs can't bail out the ball handler who veers into the defender regardless of whether they extend an arm or not. It results in free-throws, which slows the game down dramatically. It should, at best, be a no-call on average.

4) **No back-to-back timeouts.** In late-game situations, nothing is more obnoxious to me than offensive team calling a timeout, drawing up a play, executing poorly/defended well, then calling another timeout to avoid a 5-sec call.

5) **No inbounding into backcourt.** On that note, if an inbound play gets defended well, the inbounding team shouldn't be allowed to lob the ball into the backcourt. Neither is allowed in FIBA and it makes the players execute better whilst allowing the possibility of a turnover and maybe making it a little more exciting.",48,46,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hvaja2/rule_changes_i_would_like_to_see/,2025-01-06 16:33:13,"Before we change any rules I would like to see some real enforcement of the rules they actually have, especially stuff like the illegal screen and flopping rules. 

Once we see that and figure out how it changes the game then adding would be cool, and I don’t dislike any of your changes. I would actually change the timeout thing immediately but then like you said they won’t sacrifice the ad revenue even though the timeouts make the ends of games unwatchable. || The No back to back timeouts should be a given. The NBA has a last two minute problem, and this adds to it. People watch the game for the last 2 minutes. When the last 2 minutes takes 20 minutes real time, with constant stoppages. It kills momentum and concentration on the game. It’s needs to be fixed. The game can’t just come to a stop during the most important part. || This is just the eye test based opinion of mine, really more how I feel than what the league might need to improve... I might be wrong, don't take it against me, it is just how I feel.

1. Stop using Defensive 3 seconds
2. Allow more physical contact, especially in paint
3. Let the game flow in the clutch, no need to whistle every small foul, travel etc.
4. Every time a player tries to slide the elbow under the perimeter defender to bait a foul (what Harden did) shouldn't always be automatic foul
5. A slightly shorter game time? Euroleague has 40 minute system and it is honestly great, makes the games more competitive || 1 I’ve only head one other person with that take and you basically said the exact thing that they said.

2 There’s plenty of perimeter defense and there is plenty of contact as well.  The thing is offenses no how to get players open and create mismatches that’s why offenses run systems to get good defenders off their offensive players.  What changes could be made that is going to help a Center who got caught on a switch guard a guard 22+ feet from the basket?

3 once a defender is beat they need to be aware of their positioning and if they should risk a contest or not.  Defenders know offensive players look for contact and play around that fact and cause turnovers.  This will also tie into 2 because if you allow more contact from defenders this is going to cause more of these types of fouls.

4 maybe

5  as long as you haven’t crossed half you’re permitted to use that space for 8 seconds.  Once you pass the half court you can’t inbound into the backcourt. || My biggest question to many people is when they bring up physical Spotify on the perimeter is that do you know how hard it is to guard elite ball handlers today.  Like I don’t get the call for physicality on the perimeter because these players know how to deal with hand checking and they still do it today.  You just can’t rough someone up or block their path like in the past.  I don’t understand the call for it because frankly I just think it would lead to more injuries than anything. || The back to back timeouts in tight games makes the nba product literally the worst it ever is as the time it should be the most exciting. Basketball is best as a free flowing sport, and yet when a game is in the balance and tension is at its highest, we repeatedly take breaks on the action through timeouts and fouls. I think changing the end game product of the nba would do a lot to help casual viewers actually stick around (though the main issue there is the inaccessibility of games in the first place). 

To solve the end game problem, I’d make two changes. Firstly, timeouts cannot be used in the last 4 minutes of a game. Secondly, and most importantly, non-shooting fouls in the last 4 minutes of the game always result in the fouled team receiving the ball back. That way, there is no advantage to late game fouling. The fact it has become so normalised in the nba is astounding, given that every other sport takes huge steps to prevent those kind of deliberate gamesmanship in close games. It has a huge detrimental impact on the viewing product when the game should be at its most exciting || [removed] || I agree with everything, though I think #2 needs more detail/thinking.  Are we talking hand checking or other forms of physicality?  I would bet if you enacted the remaining four changes the game would improve significantly.  Hell, if you reduced time outs and fixed those bump fouls or any kind of play where the offensive player is initiating the contact not to score, but to draw the foul, you'd get better basketball.  It would allow the defences to sell out a bit more against perimeter shooters and have an honest contest between offensive and defensive players in the paint.  Right now, they kinda have to stay home because if the ball is in the paint it's basically a basket or a foul.

I do agree that the overall baseline of play is not nearly as bad as the current narrative would have one believe.  Some games are boring!  It happened in the 90s too.  My team is in the basement and they've still been mostly fun to watch and cheer for. || I like all of these, I'll add one more. Stop allowing the gather step for threes. I would also listen to arguments about just removing the gather step altogether, I always hear people that are more a fan of college basketball complain about the gather step in the NBA.  Gather step doesn't bother me on drives but honestly these players are plenty talented enough that they don't need it to still score lots of points. || I’ve had the same thoughts about timeouts. There definitely needs to be less of them, especially in crunch time. I think the use-it-or-lose-it timeouts should be allowed up until the 5 minute mark (maybe 4-minute), after which each team only has two timeouts for the rest of the game: one full timeout and one 20-second timeout.

This would lead to less stoppage for subbing offensive and defensive players, bad free throw shooters, etc. I respect that strategy, but it makes the most intense part of the game so slow. || Here are mine:
1. Target score for overtimes. It’s a variant of the Elam ending - it’s first team to score 7 points. The GLeague has been doing this for a few years and it’s great fun. 
2. Timeouts can only be called at a stoppage of play. It’s not fair that a team can bail out of a tricky situation by calling one. 
3. 1 free throw for two (or 3) points as is also done in the GLeague. The game flows better and the team in better shape is rewarded as the players have less time to rest during play. || I would add:  you no longer control your draft pick, it now belongs to a random team.  That team changes every year.  There are still the same lotto rules etc.  This would have to start in 2032 or something because teams have already traded out a ways. || I think the clock should start when the ball touches a player or the court. No more ball rolling. || I'd like it very much if they banned the gather step. Guys like giannis can do a triple euro which simply Isn't guard able.  Nba players are already among some of the best athletes in the entire world, why make it easier for them || I love 1, 3, and 5. Especially #3 and I don't think it  goes far enough. Verticality and sliding in one's own space to stay between the man and the rim need to be better understood. A defender doing that should never get called for something when the guy with the ball chooses to cause the contact. Never really thought of #5 before but it really doesn't make sense that the defender deflecting a ball out of bounds resets backcourt unless they deflect it into the backcourt first of course.

Ambivalent on #4, I could take or leave it. I don't like #2, defenders shouldn't be able to get away with cheap bumping and hand-checking any more than ballhandlers should. I think #2 is unnecessary if #3 is done plus the refs start calling moving screens and blatant travels/carries. || Hear me out, I'm sure others have advocated for removing the 3pt line. Players are better shooters and the 4 & 5 positions can also shoot high percentages from 3. The math obviously says the 3pt makes more sense than a 2 even if the rate of making it is higher.

The 3 wasn't even introduced until 1979 so there should be no issue going back to no 3pt. I'm sure the NBA wouldn't be in favor of that even if it makes more sense. 

Instead they could remove the line and put in 3pt circles. One at the top then one on each wing, each 5ft in diameter. It would reduce the number of 3s while increasing your edge because there are less being taken and made. It would be interesting strategy wise to see how teams approach this change. Defenders can't stand in the circle gate keeping unless an offensive player enters the circle. New plays would be to be developed in order to get players open in a circle. I think it'd be worth testing in the g league imo. All I know is chucking up 3s is not fun to watch. || I’d like them to allow taunting and shit talking again. There are no more meta world peace’s and bad boy pistons, those days are long gone. I’d love to see some more passion in the game || They also need to start calling more offensive fouls. The amount of extended arms guys are allowed to get away with is insane. Watching the Cavs OKC game last night, SGA got away with pushing the defender off probably almost 10 times. Then you have to endure the pain of listening to the announcers obsess over how good SGA supposedly is at creating space. || there's enough rules as it is, too bad the refs are crooked and only enforce them when it's going to win them the bet. Allen Iverson was the prime example of a carry every 2nd dribble but wasn't called his entire career until he pissed off the refs/nba.

enforce the disgusting moving screens that allow players to be entirely free on the 3pt and the amount of threes won't take a big dive but will lessen || Totally agree. They could add a million new rules but it's all moot until the refs actually enforce them. I'll add carries and traveling along with flopping and illegal screens for rules that exist but are probably called 1 outta 3 times they happen. || They can’t even enforce a 10-count on a free throw attempt. || To me it's not necessarily the late game timeouts that are excruciating, it's the late-game fouls and freethrows. The timeouts are good in close games cuz they usually don't cut to commercials and it builds anticipation for what's coming next.

The free throws though....OMG they're the worst.

I agree with Bill Simmons' idea that in final 2 minutes, any fouls that lead to 2 FTs should grant the shooting team both shots/points if they hit the 1st FT, just to speed things along. It'd also make teams reconsider the hacking strategy. || Yeah, what the hell ever happened to the flopping techs? They called a bunch in that season opener between the Knicks and Celtics last year and you never saw it again. That's still a big problem that needs more serious attention from the league. || it’s so exhausting. playoff baseball gets so exciting and the tension only ramps up with every pitch at the end of a close game in the ninth or OT when a team has to score to win or tie. those moments are what keep me a fan of the sport and basketball has somehow taken the extreme excitement and tension of the last moments of regulation (that should be the best moments in the sport) and made it into an unwatchable soulless dead product. || No more than 4 (5 maybe) TO per team ! Each team can adjust its strategy each quarter, and each team have 8 (or 10) pauses to rest. No more is needed. And on a side note, stop giving so much fouls to the offensives players. A brush on the arm before the shoot is not a foul, an offensive player literally ramming into a defender standing is not a foul. Nobody want to watch a free throws contest. || The problem with 1 and 2 is they will further slide the offensive meta in favor of 3s, which seems to be the opposite of what most people want. || The issue I'm trying to address with 2 is to allow more body contact (like more lenient on blocking fouls) on the perimeter and also don't bail out offenses with rip-through shooting fouls (which they've tried to crackdown on).

3 happens when players are running parallel. What I want addressed there are instances where the offense lowers the shoulder and creates the contact that ultimately draws a foul ([Example](https://youtu.be/ra0AOjbMb-w?si=-3W3c3BYE3mTE466)). Butler, Tatum and Lebron are especially good at it. 

As for 5, unless they've changed the rules recently, you're allowed to inbound the ball into the backcourt from the front. || >on the perimeter is that do you know how hard it is to guard elite ball handlers today. 

This, the offensive player already has a huge advantage and they can travel and palm the ball.

I would like it if they removed the 3pt line and have 3pt circles 5ft in diameter instead. One on each wing and one in the middle. This would allow players to sit back further on perimeter defense then move up if they see the player is moving back towards the circle. No more fake drive step back 3s. Also no more side step 3s which is my guy Haliburton's go to move. || I don't agree with the non-shooting foul suggestion, but I think that FIBA has it right in this regard. Intentional fouls are deemed unsportsmanlike fouls that reward a foul shot and possession, where ""intentional"" means not making an attempt at the ball.

I hated it when they first implemented the rule because I thought it would lead to a lot of late-game dustups where I'd rather just grab the guy's jersey rather than risk hurting them. BUT, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it forces me to make a play for the ball, which is what we actually want. The tricky part is making sure the refs know that you're going for the trap and steal, rather than the foul or else they're going to call the slightest contact in order to give you more clock (I'd rather the chance at a turnover and foul than a quick foul, 2 shots, and .5 more seconds). || Double-techs are just ways for refs to act like they're doing something without actually doing anything.",0.0,0.667,0.333,0.3612,0.079,0.8,0.12,0.9726,0.098,0.754,0.148,0.9993

**I hope you enjoy it!**

The New York Knicks always [come packaged with guarded optimism](https://neilpaine.substack.com/p/its-ok-to-be-excited-about-the-knicks?utm_source=publication-search). The franchise hasn’t won an NBA title in more than a half-century, [finding ways](https://neilpaine.substack.com/p/nobody-has-the-knicks-number-like?utm_source=publication-search) to [mess it all up](https://www.si.com/nba/2022/01/13/john-starks-pat-riley-1994-nba-finals-game-7-daily-cover) whenever they get especially close, but there’s also a palpable sense of excitement in New York City whenever the Knicks are on the upswing.

However, as promising as this season seems, the factors fueling New York’s success could also be what makes the team vulnerable during playoff time.

**Is Too Much Continuity Bad?**

Let’s explain that a bit more. We mentioned that the Knicks have [one of the most effective starting lineups](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?StarterBench=Starters&dir=A&sort=NET_RATING) in the league, with a net rating that trails only those of the Thunder, Cavaliers, and Celtics. (Good company to be in!) However, New York relies on its starters more than other teams. According to [data from PBPStats.com](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/team?Season=2024-25,2023-24,2022-23,2021-22,2020-21,2019-20,2018-19,2017-18,2016-17,2015-16,2014-15,2013-14,2012-13,2011-12,2010-11,2009-10,2008-09,2007-08,2006-07,2005-06,2004-05,2003-04,2002-03,2001-02,2000-01&SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&StartType=All&GroupBy=Season&StarterState=5v5,5v4,5v3,5v2,5v1,5v0), coach Tom Thibodeau is using his starters — a group that [almost always includes](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2025_start.html) OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Towns — for 18.9 minutes per night. Not only does that lead all teams this season (Denver is second at 18.0), but it’s tracking to make New York the 22nd-most heavily reliant NBA team on starters since 2000-01: 

Even putting aside [Thibs’ long-running tendency](https://www.nba.com/news/minnesota-timberwovles-tom-thibodeau-not-fretting-over-starters-minutes-load) to max out minutes for his veteran starters, it makes sense for these Knicks to be so focused on keeping their best players on the court. New York’s core group of starters from above also happens to be synonymous with its Top 5 players by [Estimated RAPTOR Wins Above Replacement](https://neilpaine.substack.com/i/150270605/nba-estimated-raptor-leaderboard) this year, generating a combined total of 19.6 WAR — the most of any team’s Top 5 in the entire league, so far. (Boston is No. 2 with 19.1 WAR from its Top 5 players.) The Knicks’ core is playing a lot, and it’s paying a lot of dividends in the standings.

Furthermore, this Knicks starting lineup has a lot of depth to it in terms of contributions. While Brunson and KAT [are far and away the team leaders](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2025.html#advanced::18) in Usage Rate — carrying nearly 60 percent of team possessions together while on the court — the overall value provided by the Knicks’ Top 5 is quite balanced in a historical sense. Here’s a plot of every pre-2025 team since 2000-01 (plus the ‘25 Knicks) whose 5 best players produced at a pace of at least 40.0 WAR per 82 games, along with the WAR per 82 of their No. 1 player: 

With the lowest team-leading figure of any team in the sample, this year’s Knicks are tracking for the most spread-out value from Nos. 1-5 on their roster of any team with a dominant five-player core since 2000-01. It’s a testament to how suited each player is to their role, plus how well they’ve been able to execute them early this season.

And the power of a strong Top 5 for a title contender is undeniable. [One of the biggest differences](https://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/post/nba_postseason_change) between regular season and playoff basketball is that rotations shorten in the postseason, [downplaying the value of a deep bench](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1492103-debating-nba-depth-vs-star-power-for-playoff-success) and emphasizing the importance of a team’s star players. (How many times have we seen a team that accrues regular-season wins on superior depth — but little star power — [flame out in the postseason](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-raptors-bench-is-destroying-the-nba/)?) In that sense, the Knicks are playing playoff-style basketball earlier than anybody else, and proving that they can win with it.

But there are downsides to taking such an approach, too.

As part of their tendency to [roll with the same 5-man unit far more than any other team](https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/traditional?PerMode=Totals&dir=D&slug=traditional&sort=MIN) in the league, the Knicks have been spamming the NBA with one action above anything else: The Brunson and Towns Pick-and-Roll (PnR).

It’s a play they’re built for. New York is a slow-paced team who loves to grind things out in the halfcourt — they [rank 26th](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2025.html#advanced-team::13) in possessions per 48 minutes (96.9) and [second-slowest](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/team?Season=2024-25&SeasonType=Regular+Season&StartType=All&Type=Team&StatType=Totals&Table=Misc) in average seconds per possession (15.4). Brunson and KAT are the team’s best offensive players by far, and they’re two of the league’s foremost experts in the art of the PnR. So it should be no surprise that, according to Second Spectrum, the duo has run 545 PnR actions this season, the most of any combination in the NBA. They are running a whopping 31.9 PnRs per 100 possessions.

How effective has it been? The duo is producing at a clip of 1.081 points per direct action, which ranks eighth among the top 20 most-used PnR combos this year and in the 62th percentile of the NBA overall. The 62th percentile is nothing to scoff at; it’s a solid night out with the boys having [Maine Lunch IPA](https://mainebeercompany.com/beer/lunch)s and wings; it’s not a night you’ll never forget, but it’s quality.

However, dig deeper, and those sweet Maine Lunch IPAs start to look slightly more like PBRs. For one thing, the Brunson and Towns PnR has seen its points per direct action decrease in every month of the season:

With the benefit of more film and data, opposing teams have learned to run coverage schemes that force Towns into a spot where he is asked to be a playmaker rather than a play finisher, where he is best. 

Two solutions have emerged to slow down the Brunson/Towns PnR:

1. **Primary Matchups:**

At the beginning of the year, teams were guarding Towns with their five-man. This matchup put the two defenders guarding the PnR action in hell: Do you switch and leave your five on an island with Brunson? No thanks. Play drop coverage and hope you can get a late contest on a Towns pick-and-pop 3-pointer after stopping the ball? Pass.

Now, teams are putting their five-man on someone other than Towns and using a more switchable defender instead, someone they wouldn't mind switching onto Brunson. The move allows for a simple switch each time the screening action happens.

After these switches, Towns and New York aren’t hunting the subsequent matchups as post-ups for him, even though he’s been pretty efficient this season in the post, scoring at 1.208 points per direct action. Indeed, he’s only attempting about five post-ups per 100 possessions.

**2. Early Rotations from First Tag Man:**

Another change has been early rotations from the backside to Towns when teams blitz the ball out of Brunson’s hands.

This coverage turns Towns into a playmaker — not his forte — rather than a finisher. Towns averages about 0.77 dribbles per touch (40th percentile), even while scoring 1.210 points per direct touch (94th). He’s a natural-born scorer, but teams are forcing him to become a passer.

The predictability of the Knicks’ scheme has allowed teams to funnel the basketball to lower-yield actions such as Towns’ playmaking opportunities or Bridges/Hart threes, none of which are considered strengths for this offense.

# Can Anyone Help Brunson Initiate?

The problem is, there aren’t other options to initiate offense that allow the NYK to play from an advantage with their starting 5 (which, again, has played *seven times* as much [as any other lineup](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2025/lineups/#all_lineups_5-man_)) aside from Brunson. 

Getting the offense playing from an advantage is all about cracking the defensive shell, aka getting them in rotation. The best players in the world at this have a combination of two strengths that they use in tandem to create fear:

* **Shooting + Ballhandling:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving, Trae Young and James Harden.
* **Strength + Ballhandling:** Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Isaiah Hartenstein, and Domantas Sabonis.
* **Speed + Ballhandling:** Ja Morant and De’Aaron Fox.

The NYK have one player in the starting five that can fit this description: Brunson, and that’s it. This makes it incredibly difficult to take the load off of JB. Just look at how few of the other Knicks’ starters can even *attempt* off-the-dribble 3-pointers — a critical ability for initiators, whose job is to instill fear in defenses, forcing them to bring two players to the ball and get other defenders in rotation — much less turn them into efficient plays: 

The predictability of the Knicks’ scheme has allowed teams to funnel the basketball to lower-yield actions such as Towns’ playmaking opportunities or Bridges/Hart threes, none of which are considered strengths for this offense.

Thus, the Knicks have a [$200 million roster](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cash/_/year/2024/sort/cash_total) with no depth that plays its starters more than anyone else but only has one consistently dangerous initiator within that group. (Every other contender has two such players.)

So what should the Knicks do with their problem of overreliance on certain plays and players? Spread the wealth — but maybe not in the way you think.

The idea of letting someone on the New York roster other than Brunson initiate the offense seems silly, so suggesting anyone else as an offensive hub is like throwing sand through a screen door. 

*(Whispers… wouldn’t it be nice if they still had a* [*7-foot playmaking hub*](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harteis01.html) *for who could quickly transition the ball from one side to the other and run efficient dribble handoff, split, or PnR actions?)*

Anyway, Brunson currently leads the league in a plethora of categories related to “touches”: 

If you don’t get the point, it’s Brunson’s show; he’s the center of the wheel, and everyone else is just a spoke.

One idea to diversify New York’s offense might be for Bridges to run more PnR as the ballhandler. He’s currently running 6.9 PnR’s per 100 (40th percentile) and scores 1.008 points per direct action (68th percentile). 

Those numbers are acceptable, albeit on low volume. But these plays are rare enough that they probably don’t make it to the top of the scouting report. Teams play whatever their base coverages are for PnR defense. If the volume ticked up and this action became a more central focus on the scouting report, you would see a lot of “under” actions, daring Bridges to shoot behind the screen.

While Bridges has had a much higher Usage Rate at times than his current 19.4 percent mark — [he was, remarkably, a 30 percent Usage guy](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-mikal-bridges-went-from-supporting-player-to-star/) after being shipped to the Nets in 2022-23 — he didn’t exactly shine when he ran a higher volume as a PnR ballhandler. Over the past two seasons in Brooklyn, Bridges executed 1,950 PnR actions, ranking 59th in efficiency out of the top 79 PnR ballhandlers by volume during that period.

These aren’t exactly impressive numbers. As a primary ballhandler in the PnR, Bridges isn’t efficient; he’s limited as a playmaker and doesn’t score at a high or efficient enough clip.

# Does New York Have A Counter Punch?

However, switching up the PnR combination might still be on the right track. The key is to insert new screeners as two-man partners for Brunson, not take the ball out of JB’s hands. 

Hart and Bridges are naturally more creative and comfortable being playmakers in an advantageous situation than Towns. At the same time, Towns creates more gravity off the ball as a shooter than either Hart or Bridges. As a result, both the Brunson/Hart (No. 7 at 1.240 points/direct action) and Brunson/Bridges (No. 3 at 1.254) pick-and-roll combos rank among the league’s Top 10 most efficient PnR pairings this season, with a minimum of 100 total PnR plays.

Unlike Towns, Hart and Bridges are both natural-born playmakers. And once they set the screen, they are both creative cutters who see the open space within the defense and consistently exploit it to create a shot for themselves or a teammate.

The potency of these combinations lies in the matchups: Opposing teams have been using their five-man as the primary defender on Hart, not Towns, while the worst perimeter defender usually defends Bridges. Deploying Hart and/or Bridges as the screener takes away the opposing team’s option to switch the action: Leaving either a five-man or your worst perimeter defender on an island with JB is, as the kids would say, [BBQ Chicken](https://www.tiktok.com/@espn/video/7338931241259093294?lang=en).

This means extra communication is needed on defense, and any time players need to communicate, it opens the opportunity for panicked thinking. These slight miscommunications can put the defense a half-step behind — and in the NBA, a half-step behind versus a smart veteran team like New York will almost always result in a quality shot.

These aren’t exactly impressive numbers. As a primary ballhandler in the PnR, Bridges isn’t efficient; he’s limited as a playmaker and doesn’t score at a high or efficient enough clip.

Another side benefit would be to make the Knicks less dependent on just two players to handle the majority of the scoring and playmaking load. Because right now, the Brunson/KAT workload is historic: New York is tracking to be just the ninth team since 1977-78 with two players boasting a Usage Rate over 27 percent and no one else on the roster at 20 percent. 

This, in turn, might make the Knicks a more unpredictable team that is harder to scheme up in a seven-game playoff series — and can more readily beat good opponents. Currently, the Knicks rank third-to-last in the quality of their victories in terms of the average [Elo rating](https://neilpaine.substack.com/p/2024-25-nba-forecast?open=false#%C2%A7nba-elo-ratings-and-form-report) of the teams they’ve beaten; only the Sixers (1428) and Wizards (1437) have won against teams with a lower quality than the Knicks’ 1438 mark.

# Contender or Pretender?

All of this might sound like we’re down on the Knicks, or being unnecessarily harsh on a team that [has a legitimate chance](https://neilpaine.substack.com/i/150270605/nba-forecast) to win the title. But in many ways, New York’s problems would be the envy of other teams. They have a core with two high-scoring stars and a supporting cast of starters that can fit into multiple roles. Perhaps recognizing this, Thibodeau and the Knicks have leaned heavily on what came most naturally for that group right away. 

But winning in the NBA is about more than talent or even money plays; it’s also about who can adapt and then counter-adapt from there. The rest of the league is beginning to figure out what New York does best, and the regular season isn’t even halfway over yet. It’s what the Knicks do from here that will determine whether they have the adaptability to finally cash in on their championship potential — or if this will be just another season of promise that goes unfulfilled in the Big Apple.",449,54,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hyc7jr/the_knicks_are_riding_brunson_and_towns_but_are/,2025-01-10 14:10:14,"It's terrifying for Knicks fans, but I really think the season hinges largely on the health of Miles McBride and Mitchell Robinson just to alleviate the minutes load on Brunson and Towns. There is not an easy solution on the team with the over-reliance on Brunson and Towns. 

Certainly, changing up the PnR partners would help, but Brunson and Towns are still on the floor. They have no choice but to live with that two man game. Other champions have ridden two stars to titles. 

When it comes to contenders, you're always searching for a tiny margin to improve. A tiny silver lining to this season is that both Bridges and OG are capable of shooting better from 3 than they have so far this season. All things equal, if both were shooting their career average, Knicks would bump up 7th to 5th in ppg and 17th to 14th in 3PM. 

Where the Knicks have to improve to catch up to the Thunder, Cavs, and Celtics is on the defensive end specifically the turnover differential. The Knicks are the 7th worst team in the league in forcing turnovers. They're just not generating enough points off turnovers which would alleviate some of the usage off Towns and Brunson. Deuce is their best defender navigating over screens, and he's been injured. 

But I also believe the defensive cohesion between Bridges, OG, and Hart will come. All three of them have had far better defensive rating seasons in their career. It's hard to catch up to the lineup stability other contenders have had when Bridges and Towns are new to the team, and OG missed large portions of last season.

The minutes load remains the biggest problem. All five starters are playing over 34.6 mpg. SGA is averaging 34.7. On the Celtics, only Tatum and Brown are playing that many minutes. No one on the Cavs are playing more than 31.4. Closing out teams, getting easy wins, getting easy buckets... is the only path forward for the Knicks to catch up to the other contenders. || A substantial amount of charts, graphs, and film edits go into the deep dive.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || A lot of their issues lately have come from a general team cool-off from behind the arc. For a team that’s built around getting players like Bridges & OG open for spot up 3s, they have not been falling the same way they were early in the season. When they’re playing a bad team, the offense is still potent enough to win despite this, because they still have a very strong presence inside the arc as well (They won a game hitting only 3 3s a couple weeks ago). However vs good teams that they can’t simply overpower offensively, they need their 3 point shooters to be hitting.

I’m not sure if it’s due to the heavy minutes played, other team figuring them out, or just a random coldness from multiple players at once, but something is definitely off offensively right now. Historically, Thibs has made the right team decisions when it comes to figuring out how to get the best out of his guys, but he always takes his time making those decisions; nothing reactionary. I trust that he will figure out what’s best for the team by playoff time, but there will be lots of bumps on the way. || Brunson-Towns Spanish P&R with either OG or Mikal (depending on who brings the worse defender into the action) could also be worth looking at || Bridges is capable of being a second on ball option and definitely needs more on ball reps. Towns isnt a “facilitator” but the dude can pass and has pretty good vision. They definitely should be giving him more post ups as well. As for the league figuring out the Brunson/Towns PnR, really not a concern. At the end of the day you put two of the best offensive players in the league in an action together and they have to make plays. Thats how any NBA team works especially in the playoffs. || [removed] || As usual with Thibs, his teams will get more regular seasons wins than another coach with same team. And then in playoffs when rest of teams play starters more minutes one sees that that weren’t as good as their record. || Bridges is gonna want to be paid and that is gonna add to the Knicks salary cap woes but their bigger issue is that they have so few picks through 2031 because of the Six-Pick-Mik trade they’ll not be able to have the young talent on rookie cost controlled contracts that big spending teams need.

I can understand wanting to trade for a popular player who is friends with others on the team but that is a “vibes” trade. You don’t give up that amount of draft equity for a player that has never been an All-Star. At least Rudy Gobert is a defensive monster in the regular season.

KAT is gonna be a $60m per season player soon and he’s already had some injuries.

I think the Nets are gonna feast on those late Knicks picks in 2029 and 2031 (but 2027 and the swap in 2028 might be good too). || [removed] || I’m ride or die the whole way with my Knicks but I have to keep it real and admit my gut says we need another piece and if it’s this year it’ll need to come via trade. Don’t get me wrong I like the team but they need reliable defense with enough offense added to our bench in the form of idk who? Johnny Isaac + Goga or 1 of them feels like a good target. Jusuf Nurkic is perfect imo for what we need and he’s priced well and riding the bench because he’s in the dog house w FO for some in game scuffle the other day. Perfect for MsG bring that dog to us we can use some guys that wanna win ugly. We kind of went from all dawgs to all pretty boys over night so Leon needs to get to work and call in those chits || I think there will be more clarity as they face some tougher opponents in the coming weeks starting with Thunder matchup today. Until I see Mitchell Robinson return and play with this squad a little, I don't want to pin down their key issues just yet, there should be much more offensive and defensive options open up with him back.

That said, I do also wish to see Mikal and Mcbride get more ball handling duties even when Brunson is sharing the floor with him to create more options on offense || [removed] || The key with other teams riding two stars is that BOTH stars can be the center of the offense that initiates advantage opportunities for others; towns, for all his talent, can not do this side of the coin.

Towns average 0.7 dribbles per touch; this is a clear sign of a play finisher, not a guy you run the offense through.

\^\^ Which is okay! He's fantastic at what he does!

The problem is they blew the big trade package on a guy who also can't do this.. that's the bigger problem. If you deal five first-round picks, you've got to get something better than a role-player. || Good post for an outsider to read. Thank you! || As usual with Thibs, his teams will get more regular seasons wins than another coach with same team. And then in playoffs when rest of teams play starter more minutes one sees that that weren’t as good as their record. || OG is a good shooter. For him, open shots are a good thing and something that teams do not want to give up.

Bridges is not a good shooter; open shots for him are the shots that teams are trying to give up; they are willing to funnel the ball to him instead of giving looks to other NYK players.

Thibs is good at this, but his teams do not make much noise come PO time. They are historically run down and injured. Consider that NYK has such a limited number of serviceable players due to poor drafting/developing and selling the farm for Bridges, and it's not exactly a combo that gets you excited about the future. || It's possible - they've run this one quite a bit with Hart. I think it's because teams are okay with Bridges taking as many 3's as he wants. || https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NqHAC/1/

^^ Numbers on Bridges as a PnR ball handler during his time in BKN. It isn't good. 

Many people say they should use him as an on-ball player like BKN. However, he’s not good at it; otherwise, they would be running him that way. 

He can't run on ball actions because you can go under every time and dare him to shoot. Teams are 100% willing to live with that every time. 

Towns: he can pass, he’s capable. Just not his strength, and that's no knock-on him. He's one of the best-scoring Bigs in the game. || I know you're trolling, but that's okay.

It refers to the Brunson and Towns two-man game (singular).

We dig deep into how they've run this one action (545 times) more than any other combination in the league and how it has had diminishing returns each month of the season as teams have accumulated more film and data on how to guard it.

Anyway, I hope you read it if you're into this NBA stuff and bring something to the discussion. If not, no worries. || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || Lots of wins vs. under .500 teams and losses vs. over .500 teams.

The tape is getting worse and worse in terms of process. They are getting stale on offense. That is what my rut comment is about, not just the wins and losses. || We removed your comment for being low effort. || What assets are left that would bring back a difference-maker without unloading one of their starting 5?

I've seen a lot of Robinson talk on here. He's not bringing back a big-time asset on his own. Sorry. || I do not consider them a serious contender for the title, but that is what makes NBA basketball fun. People can have different opinions, and we get to see them play out on the court. 

I'm excited to see what they do tonight vs. OKC. 

OKC was one of the teams that went without having their five-guard Towns and a more switchable player.

I'm interested in seeing if they post Towns on switches or avoid the action altogether and use Hart as Brunson's main PnR partner with Towns' spacing. || Please do not attack the person, their post history, or your perceived notion of their existence as a proxy for disagreeing with their opinions. || Live by Brunson, die by Brunson. Knicks fans wouldn't have it any other way.

The downside of OG and Bridges being so duplicative is that they could have gotten another creator, but with Brunson and Towns on the roster, you need defenders.

No team wins the exact same way. Perhaps, the Knicks aren't real contenders, but I think a suffocating Thibs defensive team exist in them if Robinson and McBride are healthy... and if OG and Bridges remember why they got the contracts they did.

The current Knicks team needs to mimic 2003-04 Pistons if they want to find their own way to contending. In the regular season, they need a bench lineup that can finish off games. Mike James, Lindsey Hunter, Corliss Williamson, Mehmet Okur, Elden Campbell, and Darvin Ham could finish off games in the regular season. It led to the starting lineup being able to play 40+ mpg in the playoffs.

Rasheed had the finishing but not playmaking second star issue that is currently present in Towns. Chauncey was by far the primary ball handler and shot creator. Tayshaun and Ben Wallace were in their defensive roles. And while Rip was a midrange sniper off screens, he wasn't a volume shooter who stretch the floor. Their spacing was entirely from Chauncey and Rasheed.

The question ultimately is whether the Knicks can elevate their defense to an elite level to make up for their lack of offensive versatility. || They need the reps to build the chemistry needed to take down the Celtics. But the situation still screams 4-6 minutes less per game for all 5 starters. || What makes you say that OG is a good shooter and Bridges is not? They’ve both been pretty inconsistent week to week, and right now they are separated by just 1.5% from behind the arc. Just a week ago, Bridges’ season 3p% was higher than OG’s. Also, Bridges’ midrange scoring is far superior to OG’s in terms of volume, efficiency & self creation. || I haven't really seen people clamoring for a bunch of Bridges on ball stuff at all. That isn't his game. He's not Klay level bad with the ball in his hands but he's a movement shooter. Still, I don't think you can index that much on Bridges PnR ball handling numbers on a terrible team with poor PnR partners to argue against it. 

Teams have not been going under screens for Bridges for almost the entirety of his career. He's a guy who you would much rather play tight and force him to have to drive or play-make than give him open shots, which though he has struggled from three this year, that is assuredly just a blip. Very good shooters don't just lose that ability all of a sudden and it has been creeping back up as is.

I mean he's currently shooting 42% on wide open threes this season and was at 38% on open threes last year. That isn't someone you go under a screen on. 

Also passing is one of Towns' strengths as a big - notably so. While he's not Jokic or even a Sabonis, he is quite a good playmaker for his size who has good vision and a willingness to make some pretty challenging attempts and convert on them. His *decision making* isn't great, but his touch and ability as a passer has been a career-long strength. || Even as someone who liked this article and found it insightful, my first reaction to the headline was the same. I think I would have preferred something like ""The Knicks are riding Brunson and Towns, but opposing teams are starting to figure them out""

To me that gets at the best part of the piece, which is combining the statistical observation that the two man action is becoming less effective and it's due to the tape of how opponents are guarding them differently. 

That said, I know there's a certain degree to which it doesn't matter what the headline is and people will not read the article in good faith. There's also the alternative angle in which sometimes having something easily ""correctable"" will make people engage with it more. So who knows.

In terms of the basketball philosophy questions getting posed about whether it makes sense to do the same thing over and over, I think it's an interesting question without a clear answer. On the one hand, there's the Bruce Lee quote about 1 punch practiced a thousand times is better than 1 thousand punches practiced 1 time which has some truth to it. I think employing it and seeing teams counter it throughout the regular season will also benefit the Knicks in a certain way so they can work through counters and not get surprised by that in the post season. 

On the other hand I do feel like the Warriors for example always saved the Steph-Draymond pick and roll spamming for high leverage situations. That way there wasn't as much tape for opponents to watch on something they knew would be effective and that there was more variety in their attack throughout a game and season. So there are trade-offs in both directions. The Knicks have chosen a direction though and I appreciate that there's a clarity and alignment in their approach despite the inflexibility that I think helps maximize what they get out of this group.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.062,0.786,0.152,0.9997,0.07,0.76,0.17,0.9999

They started the season 2nd in defence. But over the course of the season, Buddy Hield cooled off and the offence has cooled off. The defence has also dropped to 9th. 

While lots of people point to the Hield drop off, my instinct was that Melton was incredibly important to the Warriors. He was hitting threes at a good clip and was a really good guard defender, the true 3 and D archetype. The Warriors don't have that look next to Curry anymore in the backcourt anymore.

Injury did not help at all but what was going on was not sustainable and was largely contingent on buddy hield shooting like peak Klay on one of his monthlong heaters. Kerr also did a very good job planning for the season with limited/flawed players. Problem is that when teams started to adjust there is not much he can do because we aren’t very good from a talent perspective outside of 30 and 23 it’s mostly just a bunch of role players who are one dimensional with serious flaws in their games. 

I will say that a healthy gp2 and melton with a focused/motivated Draymond behind them was nasty defensively. || Not especially, with one exception.

As noted, the Warriors had an easy schedule to start, the only exception being the games against the Rockets and Clippers in their first seven games.

After that, they managed to beat Boston, OKC, Dallas, and Memphis, with Melton getting hurt during that Dallas game.

The one exception I would say is that the one game that made me (and maybe other Warriors fans) believe in the start the team had was that OKC game, which is nearly the *only* real game the Warriors got where Melton played as the backcourt partner to Steph and it all clicked.

Melton, in that game, went for 19/10/2 with 3 steals and shot 5/8 from 3. He was connective, took the lead defensive assignment, disrupted on defense, and just *fit*.

So, I do think the Warriors fall-off (especially defensively) would have been very much helped by Melton still playing for them, but it's not like he was the *reason* they were winning early on. || Not at all important. Buddy Hield was playing like an All Star during that stretch, it wasn’t sustainable. But that’s just imo || He missed a few games from that hot stretch, but I agree with you. He was the backup point guard and could play with or without Steph with solid defense. The collapse isn't all because of his injury, but I feel like it was a big part of it. || Well he definitely competed lineups

But ultimately the real issue is we stopped running the offence we had at the start of the year when Melton got hurt and I don't know why. || Dude the warriors were always going to taper off that hot stretch. Buddy was shooting st a crazy clip for a sec. It wasn’t sustainable.

The whole team (except Podz) was shooting exceptionally well. The defense was also really good over that time.

Then, predictably, players started to get hurt. GP2 was in and out of the lineup. Draymond missed games. Melton was done for the season. The shooting came back down to earth. Steph had a few terrible games. It just kind of all fell apart.

This is who the Warriors were always going to be this season. They don't have the personnel to generate offense without Steph. Steph is incredible, but he's 37, and he will have his ups and downs as well as missing games here and there. The team is undersized. Draymond by himself can make any defense decent. When he's off the floor though, the defense isn't nearly as good.

It seems like all anybody wants to talk about right now is how many threes NBA teams are taking, and how it’s ruining the game they once loved. I’ve been a “threes are good, actually” guy for a long time now, so I decided to go into the data and see where all these threes have been coming from. 

So why are teams gunning from deep at a historic rate? Is it because they’ve stopped abandoning the basket and are just launching from deep, taking wild gambles with the hope hitting it big and scoring that extra point will save them from having to do the hard work necessary to find a nice, reliable shot closer to the basket? Well, not exactly. This isn’t ground-breaking, but almost all of the increase in three-point volume is because NBA teams have abandoned the long two-point jumper. 

The mid-range jumper has been a reliable weapon for players like Michael Jordan (who was the undisputed GOAT of midrange jumpers and an absolute outlier from that range) and Kobe Bryant, but the writing has been on the wall for the long two ever since teams started charting the actual accuracy of those shots. (Basketball-reference has data on two-point jumpers going back to the 1996-97 season.) 

The short version of this story is that the league has never shot 50%, or all that close to it, on jumpers from 10-16 or 16-23 feet, and the NBA has shot 33% or better from three point range from 1992-93 onwards. In fact, before you say “well, it depends on the player, some guys are just better suited to having a midrange game,” it’s important to note that it’s extremely rare for ANY player to shoot better than 50% from midrange over the course of a season. Steph Curry, who is Steph Curry, has only cracked 50% from 10 to 15 feet in 5 of his 16 seasons, and the only full season he managed to shoot 50% or better from 16 to 23 feet was in 17-18. (He is currently shooting 51.5% from 16-23 feet this season, to be fair.) 

 You don’t have to be a math expert to know that 33% from three is the equivalent of shooting 50% on a two-point jumper, so it naturally follows that, on average, the three-point shot is better than a two-point jumper. 

[Here’s a visualization of how well the NBA has shot on 10-15 footers, 16-23 footers, and 3 point shots since the 97-98 season.](https://imgur.com/a/8E2zfBk) (For the purposes of this piece, I took out the data from the 96-97 season, when the three-point line was shorter.) 

(This data, and all data in this piece, was provided by basketball-reference.com)

As you can see there, you’re getting a few more percentage points from the midrange than three-point range on average, but nowhere near enough to cover the 50% benefit that comes with getting three points for your shot going in instead of two. 

It’s not a ground-breaking discovery that 3-pointers are better than two-point jumpers. However, it is still somewhat surprising to see the degree to which the NBA, as a whole, has abandoned the long two-point jumper for threes over the years. (Or, depending on your point of view, it may be surprising just how long NBA teams were taking a significant portion of their shots from the efficiency desert that is the midrange.) 

[Here's a chart showing the proportion of shots the NBA, as a league, has taken from 0-10 feet, 10-23 feet (the midrange), and 3-point range over the years, as well as the league's offensive efficiency during that time.](https://imgur.com/a/OfBRYpc) [Here's the same graph, with 10-15 and 15-23 foot shots separated](https://imgur.com/a/i7yDxwx) \-- in this one, you can clearly see that it's the 16-23 foot shot teams have specifically gone away from. (Please take a look at them, they're kind of the crux of the whole piece.)

Just take a look at that. Teams have gone from taking nearly 40% of their field goal attempts from midrange to under 15%. Consequently, the amount of shots teams take from 3-point range has gone from 15.9% in 97-98 all the way up to 42.3% this season, which would be an all-time high. As you can see at the top, the rate of shots teams have taken within 10 feet from the hoop has stayed more or less the same – the only real change in shot selection we’ve seen at the league-wide level has been the replacement of midrange shots with threes. It really is remarkable how offenses responded to ditching long twos in favor of threes – it’s like teams were trying to win Le Mans with a refrigerator in the passenger seat. 

The other thing to notice is how closely offensive efficiency, which is that purple line, has mirrored the rate of threes being shot. For the mathematically inclined, that’s a positive correlation of .912 out of a possible one. I charted the league’s FG% from every zone as well as the rate of shot attempts over the years, and 3-point rate had the strongest correlation with offensive efficiency by far – the positive correlation between overall FG% and offensive efficiency was only .700. 

Put simply, teams have replaced mid-range jumpers with threes, and that’s been by far the single biggest statistical reason offenses have gotten better. They do it because it works. 

**PART 2: THE FILM**

Admittedly, that’s a bit dry. I have a hard time believing anyone who says they “don’t like watching players shoot threes” is going to have their mind changed by a graph. (Even though it’s quite a compelling graph.) 

However, it is interesting to me how seldom people who say “the NBA used to be better” actually come have visual evidence that backs up their point. The other day, I felt like getting a quick “watching John Stockton play basketball” fix, because it had been a while. So I went to YouTube and got this clip of his 28-assist game: 

[The Game John Stockton Delivered 28 Assists in 1 Game! Highlights vs Spurs | January 15, 1991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI0CoBWRjxo)

The video’s about Stockton, but my eyes were immediately drawn to Malone. Not Karl Malone – he’s doing pretty standard Karl Malone stuff. The player I couldn’t stop watching was Jeff Malone. Malone, who went 12-22 in this game, is just hanging out and spotting up…from 18 feet away instead of at the three-point line. He’s moving off the ball and coming off a nice pin-down…but it’s 10 feet closer to the basket than it would be now. 

There are a few nice “hey, you don’t see that much anymore” shots thrown in there, like the shot he gets as the high man in a high-low post action with Malone and a quick duck-in that gets him a shot from the dotted line, but mostly it just looks like Jeff Malone is doing what all shooters do now, he’s just doing it “for free” instead of being rewarded with an extra point. Watching these highlights today is like watching Jeff Malone compete in the Tour De France on a Penny Farthing. 

Jeff Malone shot 50.8% from the field in 90-91, one of the best marks of his career. That’s really good! That’s better than any NBA team this year! (The Cavs are currently leading the league at 50.5%.) Unfortunately, the fact Jeff Malone only made one three in 90-91 means his eFG%, which takes the extra value of threes into account, was also 50.8%. This season, the only teams with an eFG% lower than that are the Rockets, Pelicans, and Hornets. The Cavs, who make both a lot of shots and a lot of threes, have an eFG% of 59.6%. 

The three-point line is there so that smaller guys, like Jeff Malone, can be almost as efficient as the big guys even though they can’t be as effective at the rim – without it, even mid-range deadeyes like Jeff Malone don’t have much chance. 

Anyways, the point is to say this: is this what the NBA has lost? Players like Jeff Malone getting the same kind of looks players today get – catch-and-shoots off penetration, moving into open space off a screen – but only getting two points when his shots go in instead of three? There’s no one clip that can definitively show the shots the league has replaced with threes, and if there was it wouldn't be a few Jeff Malone possessions, but a lot of the shots that have been eliminated from the game aren't really worth remembering fondly.

We often think of the midrange shot romantically. Players assess the defense, see the rim is defended but determine a three-pointer would be too low-percentage, and find a happy answer in the midrange, right in the seams of the defense. It’s the goldilocks shot, that perfect balance between using athleticism to pressure the rim and skill to hit an outside shot. That did happen sometimes, and still does, and always should! As compelling as the math for the three-pointer is, totally ceding the defense 13 feet of territory inside the arc isn’t a recipe for success. In fact, I think one reason 10-15 foot FG% has gone up dramatically over the last decade is that defenses have to pay so much attention to both the rim and the three-point line now, which leaves more space in the actual midrange than there ever has been. That’s good!

The point I’m trying to make here is that there were a whole lot of shots being taken that were essentially just the same shots we see now, except they were taken closer to the basket and didn’t count for extra points. I’m not sad to see that those are gone, and I really don’t think you should be either. 

I’ll also say this: go back to the first graph, the one with FG% on midrange and three-point jumpers. Up until the 11-12 season, players shot better on 16-23 feet than they did from 10-15 feet. I can’t prove it, but I have a feeling that’s because of catch-and-shoot 16-23 footers being excised from the league. Teams were already passing up jumpers close to the basket for longer ones, they just weren’t being rewarded with bonus points for it. 

**PART 3: CAVEATS**

There is some other stuff from the data I should talk about. First, eagle-eyed viewers will notice that while the three-point rate is at an all-time high this season, offensive efficiency has actually gone down from the all-time high mark of last year. Offensive efficiency is still better than it was any year before 2022, but it’s possible that we’ve squeezed midrange shots so tightly that there’s no juice left to be found. 

Also, I combined shots from 0-3 feet and shots from 3-10 feet into one category, but they’re really not created equal. Teams historically shoot at least 60% on shots at the rim, and in the last few years that’s been at 70%, but the 3-10 foot range isn’t much better than midrange – percentages there have ranged from a low of 36.5 to just over 45% for the past 3 seasons. And shots at the rim have actually been down – they peaked at 32% of all attempts in 9-10, and are actually at an all-time low of 23.4% this season. 

However, the reasons I’m still relatively comfortable combining 0-10 feet shots into one category is that the fluctuation isn’t nearly as significant in what we’ve seen out of midrange and 3-point rates, and that [the rates of 0-3 foot shots and 3-10 foot shots mirror each other almost perfectly](https://imgur.com/a/hSb3VTy).

There’s a negative correlation of -.944. Essentially, when a shot gets taken away from the rim, it goes to the 3-10 foot range, and for whatever reason teams are shooting less shots at the rim and more shots from 3-10 foot range now. There might be a floater renaissance going on that I’m unaware of, but my bet would be that this is more due to judgement calls from people tracking games than anything else, especially since FG% on shots at the rim and from 3-10 feet have been at all-time highs the last three years. I’m genuinely not sure, though, so I wanted to put this in here. 

However, to be painstakingly clear, the data shows the increased volume of 3-point shots has been caused by the drastic decrease of two-point jump shots, not the slight decrease in shots at the rim – that’s explained by the corresponding rise in shots from 3-10 foot range. 

Alright, hopefully we had fun somewhere in here. The vast majority of midrange jumpers have been replaced by three-point jumpers. It’s almost impossible to argue that it’s been bad for offenses, and I think the argument it’s bad for fans holds less water than people think, but we can get more into that another time. ",180,43,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i2a8bo/we_killed_the_long_two_should_we_feel_bad_oc/,2025-01-15 17:52:39,"Even watching Jeff Malone in the tape linked, or if alternatively you watched exclusively Rip Hamilton highlights, the aesthetics of the mid range shot and the three point shot are not the same. On a mid range spot up, the ratio of time you spend watching a player shoot and watching the ball go through the air is about 1:1. On a three pointer, it's closer to 1:2 from a combination of faster release and more time in the air on threes, and players more often releasing the ball on the way up compared to a mid ranger which is more often shot at the apex of the jump.

A second aesthetic difference that doesn't show up on any highlight tape is what happens when the shot is missed. The rebounds on threes are way longer and way more random than on mid range shots. As a result you see way more rebounds that bounce on the floor before any player touches it and in general reduces the value of big men being good at rebounding and takes away another battleground on the floor.

Now, nobody is measuring these things with a timer, and aesthetics are always somewhat a matter of taste, but these things tend to add up in such a way that in the older game, I felt like I was spending more time watching the athletes and the moves they make, even if they ended in long twos or relatively inefficient post ups, and in the modern game there's a lot more time proportionally spent watching in the ball in the air and bouncing around, especially on bad shooting nights.

One last thing I'd point out is that corner threes, even compared to baseline long twos, happen in the part of the screen that's hardest to see compared to action that happen at the top of the key or at the elbows or at the rim and if the game were a movie it's not where you'd want the action be in the frame.

Players like Curry and Caitlin Clark prove that the new aesthetic can be just as popular or engaging. But I've seen repeatedly now that people try to use statistics to argue there isn't a significant aesthetic difference and even as a long time hater of the eye test, I find this use of data unconvincing. That said, even if we somehow brought back the mid range or other aesthetics people have nostalgia for, the knowledge of how suboptimal a shot it is in a hyper competitive environment means it likely won't hit the same either without some kind of rule change or rule enforcement change. || Just here to say, thank you for the time and effort you put into this. It's great. || Are you able to break it down by the shooting range used by BBref for mid range?   10-16,   16 - 3pt?  

I was watching a greatest season of (Kevin Garnett 03-04)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUaXbXD_F80]  He has 24% of his shots in the the 10-16 ft range,   32% of them in the 16- 3p territory.  His most accurate shooting range was 10- 16 ft at 46% for the 03-04 range. 16ft + was at 44.8%

I would expect it today's era,  his shots in the 16 ft + range would be moved out to the 3 pt line. I do wonder how much his 10 -16 ft shots would be reduced. || 
I think the thing about long-2 is that it opened up other shots since you could step back for a 3 or blow by them for a middy or lay. 

It’s one of those “doesn’t show up in the stats” type things, but it explains why some players are able to get a bucket whenever the team needs, they are able to make sure the defender is always at a disadvantage. || Great post. I don't know that there is a way to quantify it, but I think when people say ""too many 3s"" it is less a reflection of the absolute quantity and more that (1) player skill has made 3 point opportunities too valuable and (2) decent 3-point shots are simply too easy to generate.   
  
Further, it seems clear that this is the most efficient way to play under the current rules and is only going to become more and more prevalent (as opposed to say the NFL, where there are clear tactical trends from year to year but defenses are typically able to find counters to new strategies more readily). 

Philosophically I don't know that there is an objectively right answer for the league. Clearly it is more skilled than it ever has been and will only continue to improve over time - that seems like a good thing. But it does seem that the incentive to shoot 3's has become too strong in a way that doesn't seem beneficial to the product and health of the sport. || I had this line of thinking relatively recently.  I think the change in NBA defenses is as responsible for the rise in 3s as much as anything.  

Open corner 3s aren't occurring because the defense can't guard a man standing in the corner.  They're not running an action designed to prevent a defender from getting to him open in that spot. Players are open in the corner because that man's defender chooses to be available as a help defender at the rim instead. 

Going back decades, zone defenses used to be illegal.  You had to either be guarding your man or double-teaming another player, not guarding an area of the floor.  Now you have hybrid schemes where you're effectively playing man on the strong side but something that looks like zone on the weak side, hanging out with one foot in the paint on the weak side guarding no one in particular unless someone drives to the paint or the ball swings around the perimeter.  

Defenses give up the corner 3 on purpose.  Defenses snuff out post-ups in the paint on purpose.  The rule changes which allowed zone defenses in the NBA also led to the Thibodeau-style hybrid defenses that take defenders away from their man at the  3-point line to clog the paint and help at the rim, because shots at the rim are still typically better for the offense than a shot at the 3-point line. 

The Cavs beat the Pacers the other night by adjusting into heavy doses of a full zone defense after getting beaten by Siakam post-ups and Nembhard drives too many times in their previous game and the first half.  It was an extreme case of taking away 2s, and it does leave the 3-point line open (as well as breaking down with too much ball movement and different offensive sets). || Honestly I think this is an issue in the playoffs, seems like teams bad from midrange suffer in the playoffs when good defenses take the other options away and you have to take what you get.


The reduction in mid range practice during the season may be hampering some teams when they hit the playoffs. Defensive intensity and close outs are on another level and finals teams always seem like they have a few guys who can hit middys at a decent rate.


3s > everything else during regular season.


Whole bag is needed for the playoffs. || Very cool analysis, and thanks for the Stockton 28 assists link, that was fun. Forgot that Rod Strickland was on the Spurs back then.

I mentioned this in the fairly recent similar thread about the long 2 disappearing but my comment got buried- where do fast breaks/transition offense fit into the conversation and data? They don't seem accounted for at all, and maybe the drop in shots from 0-3 feet is small enough that it's not worth talking about. But it used to be that fast breaks would get finished at the rim, occasionally with a pull-up around the FT line or a short baseline jumper, and nowadays a lot more transition offense ends in a 3.

Again, good analysis, curious about how transition offense is accounted for or if you think it matters. || There's more to it than just percentages. It's easier to produce trips to the line from the mid range. 

It's also strategic in keeping the defense guessing

But the biggest benefit to midrange, is it reduces long rebounds. || [removed] || Today's game is very difficult for the defenders so offenses can get almost any shot they want and the best shots are uncontested dunks (rules do not allow hard fouls) and wide open 3's (because players today spend a disproportionate amount of practice time on 3s from an early age).

In the 80s, there were no uncontested dunks (in the half court) because every team had 3 goons to give hard fouls. 3 point shooting off the dribble was much tougher because hand-checking was allowed.  You had to run players around screens to get them open like Reggie Miller or have a guy like MJ force a double team.  But most importantly coaches hated 3 pointers for a long time like they hated going one on one too much.  They wanted to draw up a play for layup. || This absolutely rocked.  You make good use of data and then use anecdotes to tell your story very effectively.   || This is the best post I've ever read here, and that's saying something. I've been waiting to see this exact breakdown - if total jumpshot % is any higher, etc. 


Great stuff, and thank you so much! || I'm old enough to remember when video killed the radio star.  It was a painful transition, but I think we are better off for it.

Ultimately, this comes down to what is being taught at the youth level. Increased focus on skill and shooting over height and athleticism is bringing all sorts of new athletes in. Our local youth bball leagues are looking more like soccer youth leagues.

Basketball will always be mainly a big person's game, but I'm okay with the little guys being invited to the party. That is... until the big guys master long-range shooting, too. || I mean, no accounting for taste. I personally was never able to enjoy early-clock mid-range jumpers after I saw the data for the first time back around 05 or 06 (back on [82games.com](http://82games.com) they used to separate out eFG% on jumpers from shots at the rim, and almost everyone had an eFG% on jumpers under 50%, so it was pretty easy to put the pieces together from there), but that's my experience. Some people miss Vlad Guerrero trying to smack a ball into the stands after it bounced, but I just cringe too hard whenever a potential 3-1 count becomes a 2-2 count, ya know? If your tastes are that attuned to mid-range ball I'm not gonna try and throw more graphs at you about it. 

Personally, I find my Rip Hamilton itch scratched by JJ Redick, Kyle Korver, Curry, or whomever else dancing around screens on the perimeter, but if you're a pin-down or floppy guy to the core I get it, you're not gonna see that as much any more. The extra second is legit -- I think it adds some drama to the ""Curry...BANG!"" moments, but it really goes the other way on those ""why did you shoot that, Josh Smith?"" moments. || Some seriously good analysis here, really interesting to see how much effort people put into compiling all this data and presenting it in an easy to read post || Done, a second graph has been added that separates the two categories. Great idea, it is specifically the 16-23 foot shot teams have really been ruthless about cutting. 

KG is 100% a guy who I think came along too late in a lot of ways, those catch-and-shoot 20-footers he loved (especially on the Celtics) would 100% be threes now. He was also a guy who loved his midpost shots though, and that was the staple of his game in Minnesota, so in some ways it's possible the old meta benefitted him, even though it was ""objectively"" a lower-efficiency shot diet. || It's also something that (anecdotally) seems to make more of a difference in the playoffs as well as defenses tighten up.  The truly great scorers (like KD) are *still* absolutely money on long 2s and can punish defenses that overindex on taking away the ""analytics"" shots in favor of giving wide-open long 2s. (which then also leads to what you were saying-- it makes the defense uncomfortable and potentially gives easier looks elsewhere too if they have to start guarding the long 2)

I might be completely off base and incorrect in this assertion though, as I'm bringing literally no data to the table || Yeah.

I feel like stars in the league who don't have a mid-range game find it probably harder to get a bucket in the playoffs than not. Defense is significantly better in the playoffs,  opposition is always trying to find ways to cut down on stars getting to their 'spots'.

Adding a completely different dimension to your shooting just makes players harder to guard and there are so many times where you'll see midranges closing out games in the playoffs in tight games opposed to really attacking the rim or a big triple. || Contested long-2’s are the last resort, end of the clock shots after the defense has taken away multiple of your options. Every team can use a player or 2 who can take and make these shots, but if your team’s offense is built on the threat of the long 2’s, your team is just not going to score enough points to compete || DLo in his first nets stint did this a lot and that’s when he was an allstar so I think there’s something to your point || Not a mistake! I'm talking about Jeff Malone, a totally different person! And if the ""hidden"" benefit of long twos was as strong as you say, I don't think offensive efficiency would correlate nearly 1-to-1 with the increase in 3-point rate, since the increase in 3-point rate is due almost entirely to the elimination of the long two. || My reflexive answer would be that there were a lot more long twos happening on fast breaks that we just don't really remember. A few players, most notably Russell Westbrook, loved a pull-up from around the free throw line that Kevin Arnovitz of TrueHoop named the PUJIT. (Pull-Up Jumper In Transition.) 

Link to an article about Russ' PUJIT: [Modern Moves: Russell Westbrook's PUJITs](https://fansided.com/2018/01/24/modern-moves-russell-westbrook-pujit/) (note: Russ shot 38.2% on 10-15 shots that year.) 

I can't get data specifically on fast breaks from PBPStats (I think I'd need to fork over the 10 bucks a month to get there), but from 2000-2012 (which is before the three really started spiking), 17.67% of possessions that started with a steal and 26.61% of possessions that started off a missed shot ended in a long mid-range jumper. 

52.84% of possessions that started with a steal ended with a shot at the rim, and 34.08% of possessions that started off a missed FG ended at the rim. 

Over the last 3 years, which is when the three-point rate hit the max, 4.01% of possessions that started with a steal and 7.21% of possessions that stated off a missed shot ended in a long mid-range jumper. 

There has indeed been a slight dip in rim frequency in those situations -- 48.85% of possessions that started with a steal have ended in a shot at the rim, and 31.51% of possessions that started off a missed shot have ended in a shot at the rim. So it's there, but very slight compared to the reduction in long twos.  

Personally, I'm a fan of the corner 3 in transition if there's a defender under the rim, and the pull-up 3 is tolerable from players who have the footwork and touch, although some players probably take it too far. The real difference, just like everything, is when players get too ambitious from 3 in transition, that ""mistake"" lives in its own special little corner of the box score while the ill-advised PUJIT from 15 gets to hide with all the layups. || 7.2% of his shots are from 16-23 feet, where he shoots 44%. 19.3% of his shots are from 10-16 feet, where he shoots a mind-boggling 57% -- KD (57.5% from 16-23 in 21-22 and 57.1% from 16-23 this season) is the only other player I've seen do that from either midrange area. (Off the top of my head, but I've looked through this stuff a bunch.)

That is better than Steph's ever done from midrange, that I can tell you. Shai is a deadeye midrange shooter and he finds those ""goldilocks"" shots I talked about in the post -- he's not doing catch-and-shoot long twos, he uses his drive and just a bit of extra contact to get that nice look. Nobody's here to say Shai isn't awesome -- the thing about truly great players is they're more unique than they are similar.

Even Shai does shoot just slightly more 3s than midrange (27.5% of his shots come from 3, 26.8% from midrange); at 35.6%, that's 53.4% eFG%, so he'd actually be better-served trading some of his 3s for shots from 10-15. 51.6% of his shots come from inside 10 feet, so calling midrange jumpers his ""whole bag"" might be a bit reductive, but he certainly shows there still is, and always will be, a place for midrange jumpers in the NBA. || I recall basketball blogs in that era specifically really hated the shot and even gave it an acronym. The PUJIT or pull up jumper in transition. The mid range version of that shot is completely gone in a way nobody misses as traditionalists hate any kind of jump shot in transition so they didn't like it either. 

There are some ""bad"" shots that I do miss, like the pump fake then step into long two that is largely replaced with the pump fake then side step into a three. 

That said, I don't think anybody really gets a Rip Hamilton itch. And the closest analogue I can think of in terms of both style and caliber of player is Klay Thompson, a significantly more popular player that could turn regular season games into must watch events in a way mid range twos through off ball movement have never done for any player. 

I know my first comment comes off as strongly in defense of the older aesthetic, but I'm less disputing whether we should be glad they're gone, which can be a matter of taste, and moreso disagree with the idea that these shots are ""essentially just the same shots"", which in theory can be established or disproven more objectively. To me they look and feel quite different both individually and across a game. Though at this point I've seen the sentiment that it's the same shot often enough that it might be more subjective than I thought. || Thanks.  

It would be very interesting nowawdays to see how many shots in the 16ft+ range are actually within 6 inches of the 3 pt line in the current era. But I doubt that type of data exists publically for free.

The old meta definitely helped KG.  With greater spacing and less help around in a low block post up would have likely greatly improved his 0-3 attempt numbers.  Lots of time he went into his dream shake b/c help would come if he attacked the rim. || Yea this tracks. Kg has always seemed like the most likley benefit from the era switch.  His jumper was both solid fundamentally and had room to expand distance wise and wasn't dependent on fundamental accuracy from close.   Its hard to describe but just watching you could tell which bigs were capable of stretching out form 16 ft and which were more likely to succeed from sticking close to the basket.  Kg was always one where it looked like he could just shoot, period. || That’s what I’m getting at, guys like Kobe wore down their defender by making them constantly work, both physically and mentally, having to watch his every movement not sure when or where he would pull up. 

When a superstar does this, it tires out the opponent’s best defender, which breaks down the team’s defense, and team’s morale in general.

It simply makes you more predictable when you ignore 20%~ish of the space to shoot. || Thinking basketball has a podcast about this: [Why Kobe improved in the playoffs | Enhanced podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5i3UexwTYg) || You are comparing the entire league. 

I’m talking about a select few players, who have the ability to make them with regularity, and would be beneficial.

My stats were taken from StatMuse, NBA.com and Basketball Reference.

I took some of the best scorers of our time, clearly the most prolific ones such as MJ, Kobe Harden ( a well known free throw marchant), Doncic and LeBron averaged just the same free throw attempts as SGA yet they're not called free-throw marchants although when watching games James and Doncic tend to flop.

 Considering that most of SGA scoring attempts are either the ISO or Drive especially with his weird playing style a lot of defenders tend to lean their bodies more into SGA and he also initiates a lot of contact in order to get some space in his shot creation but it seems a lot of his critics do not actually watch his games and also don't bring up actual stats like I have. This is r/NBA discussion so I'm down to have people refute my stats and facts by having a debate like thoughtful individuals. Peace to you all.

His midrange jumpers (and now 3s) are so consistent, defenders cannot give space and he uses that to his advantage. But I think SGA also plays up to his somewhat lean frame in creating contact and selling fouls more than tanks like LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard || SGA critics will always make it about how he gets his FTA's, not how many he gets. Much easier to do mental gymnastics that way. If you cite averages, they'll say he foul baits more against good teams. If you say he dropped 40 with 5 FTA against the Cavs, they'll ignore you and link a clip of him exaggerating contact that you could find if you search for any great player's name + ""flop"". || [removed] || [removed] || Anyone who calls anyone a free-throw merchant is just not a serious fan of basketball. Drawing fouls is an intelligent thing to do, and it’s as valuable a skill as there is. You put your opponent on the back foot, make it so that they have to play worse defense to stay out of foul trouble, and you get easy shots. || Someone like Shai who’s learned to play the Canadian brand of basketball was never taught to have the same kind of dawg that Americans have. Hence why the top floppers/free throw merchants are all foreign born players. || He does lean head first into defenders a lot then snaps his head back. I don’t like to watch it because it’s so obvious but you can’t even blame sga for doing it if the officials keep rewarding it. || Exactly, at this point there's no reason to respond to them. He dropped 37points out of 54 points last night yet they bring up the free throws all the time. || We removed your comment for being low effort.

If they want to change the foul system, then change it. The reduction of shooting fouls has been better. || Foul baiting is putting the game in the hands of the referee, not playing basketball. I would love to see a sharp increase in offensive fouls called when an offensive player blatantly baits the defender. This is like in the NFL if an offensive lineman was able to do a false start at will but the defender gets called for offsides the moment they take the bait. Yes, there is a fine line between this and the early 2000's 95 point slugfests. Neither are good.

How can you talk about the Canadian hoop scene without having watched it?

Not hating on the guy, lots of other players do it.  But now I can't *not* hear it. || He certainly exaggerates contact, just like every good NBA scorer. People have just fixated on clips of the egregious head snaps he's done in the past because it looks especially dumb, and confirmation bias does rest. I'm a biased homer, so I find the FT merchant accusations hilarious because I'd say the more legit critique of SGA is offensive fouling with his arm clears and shoulder bumps. Even then, it's debatable, and not anything that MJ or Kobe didn't use to the same degree. Only thing he can do at this point is win a title tbh. Without the hardware, it's a lot easier to disregard how legit his game is. || I’m not against a slight change in the rules to allow more physicality, but it’s a real fine line. The last time they allowed more physicality (ie hand checking) it helped deflate overall scoring, which absolutely is more boring than watching a dozen or so extra free throws per game. || Foul baiting isn’t real. It’s called “the defender put themselves in a bad/aggressive defensive position and the offensive player took advantage.” For example, the Embiid rip through. If you are going to extend your hands into the offensive player’s space, and they then move a body part within their space to where it makes contact, the refs are rightfully going to call a reach in foul. Another one I see people complain about is when Trae Young drives and then stops on a dime to get the trailing defender to run into him. The defender is in the wrong 100% of the time. Young is in his own space, if he stops, the defender also has to stop before he makes contact. If players don’t want to get called for a foul, they have to play less aggressive defense. However, that has its own risks. || I'll go long on this someday, but do we really think that if ""you don't get cheap fouls, but you can grab people and elbow them in the chest really hard and you won't get called for it"" that Joel Embiid, who is 7'1 and weighs 280, is all of a sudden going to be completely helpless? Sure, he gets injured a lot, but that's from all that weight moving very fast on ligaments that aren't built to do that, not an elbow going into his chest. For 98% of NBA players, I'm betting ""you can elbow him, but he gets to elbow you back"" ends badly for the other guy when Joel Embiid is involved. 

At the end of the day, I feel like Joel Embiid would be able to learn how to elbow people and get elbowed a lot faster than Bill Wennington would be able to learn how to hit threes and hit a crossover into a fadeaway from the high post, ya know? || Embiid is a big man and has a PPG dropoff so bad in the playoffs that it actually [broke records](https://fadeawayworld.net/joel-embiid-had-the-largest-ppg-drop-in-the-playoffs-for-an-mvp-in-nba-history) for an MVP calibre player. A good amount of that dropoff is from his foulbaiting habits in the regular season. 

Shai is a smaller player and yet doesn’t seem as reliant on baiting fouls to generate points. || And that’s also ridiculous. Again, I personally will never give a player crap for trying to get to the line. I did it when I played because it was the right move to make from a basic strategic level. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || It’s not a cheap way of playing the game. It’s an intelligent way to play the game. If you don’t foul them, you don’t send them to the line, but that requires playing straight up defense. Players like Luka, Embiid, Trae Young, and SGA are good enough to where you can’t do that. None of these guys are talentless bums who can only shoot free throws. If they aren’t drawing fouls from overly exuberant defending, they’ll find another way to score. They just take advantage of the fact that they can’t be played straight up, and that’s just smart basketball. || Adam Silver has allowed foreigners to turn the NBA to a soap opera, please || Agreed. Totally.  And I love that they got rid of the leg kick and such. But overall my problem is the refs have too much to do with the game. It’s too front and center. But it is what it is unless they change it. || If foul baiting isn't real, then why do we have some of these quotes? To be clear, some are sour grapes, but still...

>""The way we're teaching the officials, we're just enabling players to BS their way to the foul line.""

>""We have enabled the players, and they are taking full advantage. It's a parade to the free-throw line, and it's disgusting to watch.""

\-Steve Kerr. It was after a loss, but still...another quote from him, after a loss as well, where he even mentions this in regard to his own star player:

>""I love what I'm seeing. I think the officials are doing a great job. The game has more of an authentic feel. You are seeing some players draw fouls that maybe they would have gotten the last few years, and they are not being rewarded for that.""

>""I think there's a purity to it that I'm seeing. We even saw Steph, a couple of times pump fake, start to jump into his guy and then realize, ""Oh I'm not going to get that,"" and he moves the ball on.""



>“Last year, there was an adjustment,” Silver began. “Part of it was a response to the basketball community that they felt we were allowing players to hunt for fouls, particularly in certain offensive plays were not traditional basketball plays.

So yeah, I'm calling nonsense on the idea that foul baiting isn't real. It's just another way to flop without hitting the floor.

As far as the rip move: The defender is not initiating the contact on the rip through move, though. And replays often show the offensive player making the move to initiate contact, not to make a basketball play. And some videos will show Embiid actually locking the opponent's arm so they can't get away thus drawing the foul. As for Trae letting a defender run into him: is he trying to make a basketball play, or get the refs to call the whistle? The way you word it you even admit he does it to get the defender to run into him. || Gilbert Arenas brain rot effects are very visible on you. Rodman was one of the biggest floppers I've ever seen. He flopped just as much as Divac but you probably view him as a tough American and symbol of physical 90s-early 00s game. Get a reality check. || That’s just the nature of basketball. It’s a fast moving, physical game that paradoxically does not allow contact, so the rules have to draw the line somewhere and the refs are given the extremely difficult task of deciding what is and isn’t a foul.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.018,0.879,0.104,0.9925,0.088,0.761,0.151,0.999
Stephen Curry,"""Stephen Curry"" OR ""Chef Curry"" OR ""Steph"" OR ""Curry"" OR ""Stephen""",2025-01-20,nbadiscussion,1i70obp,Team Standing vs. Individual Performance in Regards to MVP,"So there's a lot of discussion about whether Shai or Jokić should be leading for MVP right now and I was thinking about how much winning vs. individual performance not only should matter, but also has mattered for the MVP race.

Jokić is having an all time season, averaging close to a 30 point triple-double which has only been achieved twice before by MVP winners Oscar Robertson and Russel Westbrook. 

Shai is currently leading the Thunder to be on pace for a 70 win season, which has also only been done twice before by teams which were led by MVPs in Micheal Jordan and Stephen Curry. 

The Cavaliers are also on pace for a 70+ win record, but it seems to be pretty much agreed upon that Shai's individual performance outweighs anything anyone on Cleveland is doing right now, so long as their records stay similar. 

So an argument I've been hearing in regards to Jokić is that the Nuggets aren't performing well enough for him to win a real MVP, apparently regardless of his insane performance. This does obviously also have to do with SGA and the Thunder's success this season, but for reference: 

Jokić is currently averaging 30.1-13.2-9.9, and the Nuggets are 4th in the west with a .619 record.

MVP Westbrook averaged 31.6-10.7-10.4, and the Thunder were the 6th seed with a .573 record.

MVP Oscar Robertson averaged 31.4-9.9-11.0, and the Royals were the 2nd seed with a .688 record. There were like 9 teams back then but they still went 55-25 if you're interested.



Now, if Shai does lead the Thunder to 70+ wins and keeps up his performance, it will be pretty hard to argue against his MVP case. Lets say they do wind up falling to 65 wins though, something that has still only been done 21 times. Of those 21 teams to win 65+ games, 15 were lead by MVP winners. The 6 who didn't are as follows:

The 1972 Lakers went 69-13, MVP went to Kareem who averaged 34.8-16.6-4.6 on the 63-19 Bucks 

The 1997 Bulls went 69-13, MVP went to Karl Malone who averaged 27.4-9.9-4.5 on the 64-18 Jazz

The 2008 Celtics went 66-16, MVP went to Kobe who averaged 28.3-6.3-5.4 on the 57-25 Lakers

The 2009 Lakers went 65-17. MVP went to Lebron who averaged  28.4-7.6-7.2 on the 66-16 Cavaliers 

The 2016 Spurs went 67-15, MVP went to Stephen Curry who averaged 30.1-5.4-6.7 on the 73-9 Warriors

The 2017 Warriors went 67-15, MVP went to Russ who averaged 31.6-10.7-10.4 on the 47-35 Thunder



With the 09 Lakers and 16 Spurs, the MVP went to the best player on a team that had an even better record. With the 72 Lakers and 97 Bulls. the MVP went to the best player on a team with a worse record, but that team still had 60+ wins and the player put up an arguably better performance.

The 08 Celtics and 17 Warriors are outliers however because the MVP went to a player on a team that was under 60 wins, despite having 66 and 67 wins respectively. With both of these teams, part of the ""problem"" was that there was no clear best player on their rosters. It was easier to attribute their success to 3 or more players on the team rather than any one players performance, where Kobe and Westbrook during those years were clearly the best players on their team. 

08 is also interesting however because LeBron was statistically a better player than Kobe that year putting up 30.0-7.9-7.2, but his 45-37 record was used against him, meaning that year the award went to neither a player on a historically good team nor the best player stat wise.

  
So depending on how the rest of the season goes it could be one of the most divisive MVPs of all time. There have obviously been other questionable years in the past, but if everything pans out how it has been going (Jokić averages a 30pt triple-double, Thunder AND Cavaliers get 70+ wins,) they could give it to SGA or Jokić and not be wrong, so they'll probably give it to Shai due to ""voter fatigue.""

However there are still a few interesting scenarios: What if the Thunder drop to \~65 wins but the Cavs hit 70+? Would Donovan Mitchell get it for the historic record? What if the Nuggets get the 2nd seed? What if Jokić leads the league in 3+ categories by the end of the season? There are so many ways this award could go depending on if these players/teams can stay the course, I'm interested to hear some other people's input at this point in the season.",22,33,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i70obp/team_standing_vs_individual_performance_in/,2025-01-21 21:38:02,"I think this conversation hit a fever pitch like 10-ish years ago when you had Curry and the Warriors crushing everybody, while Harden was putting up near-nightly triple-doubles every night and almost singlehandedly dragging the Rockets into the 8th-seed.

My view is that, if you're top 5 in at least 2 major categories, you deserve to be in the discussion. Then you factor in team performance. IMO, it's way harder to be the top guy on a stacked team that wins, than the top guy on a team that barely makes the playoffs (even if they would be a basement team without them).

Beyond that, I rarely ever have a problem with who wins MVP because it can be so subjective and they're all deserving at that point. || The difference between this year and previous years, to me, is that it's actually close now. Advanced stats *don't* have Jokic as easily the best player. (BPM does but I think that's because it favors big man assists a lot.) EPM has SGA ahead and bball-index LEBRON has them neck-and-neck. Neil Paine's estimated RAPTOR has them neck-and-neck as well. As far as other comparison points, Jokic's averages are crazy, but so is OKC's team performance, currently on pace for the all-time net rating record. Obviously supporting cast plays a huge role, but without Shai (and assuming Chet is still hurt) it's not a crazy talented lineup? Deep for sure, but would definitely struggle offensively. A Jokic-less Nuggets would struggle way worse but tbf the Nuggets *with* Jokic are well behind OKC too. And his backup is Deandre Jordan which makes the with-or-without-him argument make him look a lot rosier than it is. Anyhow I think either player would deserve it if they keep this up. We can just sit back and enjoy. || It was the same for Luka last season. He did have an all time great season. The team was injured a lot. Once everyone was available, the team also performed very well. And then they made it to the finals.
 
But no MVP for this ridiculous season, because of missing team success. He was third actually. I would be a bit mad if now for Jokic „rules“ were different.  || You are pretty much ignoring the fact fhat SGA is also having an alltime season. || It really depends on if we are debating who we think deserves MVP. Or if we are debating who we think the voters will select.

Shai is leading because voters historically skew towards narrative over contribution. The narrative is that OKC is having an all-time great season, and Shai is the driver of that success. 

The narrative isn't how Jokic is single handedly carrying a weak Nuggets roster with historic performance. Not because he isn't doing that. It's because he's done that for 4 straight seasons, so it's not new or noteworthy. 

It's why the Bball reference tracker, which is based on stats has Jokic at 66% to Shai's 24%. But the betting odds have Shai as a 3-1 favorite to win it. || I think the easy answer for why team success is so heavily valued in NBA Awards voting is that players have a lot more flexibility in their roles that you see in other team sports. 

In baseball, the batter is trying to get hits, the pitcher and defensive players are trying to get outs. It's pretty straightforward. Likewise for football, the offensive players are trying to get yards, first downs, and touchdowns, the defense is trying to stop them. Most of the real ""decisions"" are made on the sidelines.

In basketball, the goal is to accumulate possessions and efficiently turn possessions into points. Rebounding and turnovers get the team X many possessions, which is the currency the offense has to win the game. Every time you take a shot or turn the ball over, you're ""spending"" a possession. Every shot a player takes ""robs"" a teammate of an opportunity to take that shot. Let's say a player scores 50 on 40 shots, making 20 of them. What would have happened if those 20 missed shots were taken by his teammates? It can be pretty hard to know. If a player takes just 10 shots but makes 8 of them, was he passing up opportunities by not shooting and hurting his team that way? 

TL;DR it's very hard to know if players are making the ""right"" choices on a macro level to help their team, and ""well, if the team won, it was probably a good choice"" can be a very helpful thing to fall back on. 

Narrative can play a role too. For example, in 2016-17, KD led the Warriors in most advanced statistical categories, but the team's record went from 73-9 to ""just"" 67-15 after they added him in the offseason. So it felt weird to give the MVP to KD, and he kinda cancelled out 2016 MVP Steph. || I've always thought that while I don't always agree with who wins the MVP, it always goes to someone who deserves it. It was always gonna be a subjective award, so while I think some players on some years deserve it over the eventual winner, you can't really argue that the one who won didn't deserve it that year

Yes, stats matter. Yes, team success matters. Yes, even storyline matters. And criteria for voting is allowed to change every year. That's really just the nature of the award. || I mean some advanced stats have Jokic leading all time for a single season rn, and by a pretty large margin. Idk how you can say advanced stats don't support his MVP case when they are some of the best supporting evidence for it lol there's really only a couple Shai has over Jokic.

Like sure 30.1-13.2-9.9 is impressive, but doing it while also leading all of NBA history in PER and BPM is insane. For reference MVP Westbrook who had a similar stat line is ranked 27th in PER and and 19th in BPM all time. || Luka had a great season last year, I thought he deserved MVP too, but Jokic is just on another level this year. Like I mentioned before the 2017 Warriors won 67 games, but the MVP went to Westbrook who couldn't even hit 50 with the Thunder that year.

Basically the NBA and the voters have set themselves up to contradict themselves no matter who wins this year, and honestly that's probably better for media attention. || 1. Everyone in the MVP race every year is having an all-time great season.

2. Playoff performance has literally zero to do with a regular season award, mentioning it at all is just trying to prop up a weaker argument.

3. Why are you assuming that 'missing team success' was the sole reason for Luka not receiving the award? Perhaps some voters thought that Jokic simply had the more valuable season? ||  It  was more than lack of team success. He missed 12 games compared to 3 for Jokic and per game stats for Jokic at least matched him. Jokic had fewer points but with more rebounds, better shooting efficiency, and fewer turnovers. || I don't agree with this statement, can you make your case for it to me?  A great season?  An MVP season?  Sure.  But all-time? || Yeah it's not really the same. All time for Shai maybe lol, but in regards to whats been done before it's just really good. If SGA and Jokic were putting up the same numbers they are today but the Thunder wasn't doing as well it'd be way less of a debate. SGAs 31-5-6 is great, but it doesnt hold a candle to Jokic putting up 30-13-10 on incredible efficiency. When I say all time I mean this season by Jokic is potentially a top 10 season by any player ever. SGA is not doing that this year, he's only in the conversation with Jokic because he's leading his TEAM to a historic all time season. || Well Luka had great stats and was dragging a bad Mavs team last year but winning less than the Nuggets was the main factor in losing it. 

I would say the gap this year in winning is even further than that. Thunder on pace to win 70 games is insane. It's too much winning. Too much! || PER is a pretty rudimentary advanced stat, and as i said, BPM weights big man assists higher than guard assists which is why i think it's misleading in Jokic's case. Also Shai right now is 9th all-time for BPM (22nd in PER) so he's not even trailing by that much anyway. EPM, LEBRON, and estimated RAPTOR are some of the most advanced all-in-one stats which is why i favor them over PER and BPM. || Those rebounds are pretty but he plays 35 mpg at center. How many rebounds does an avg C get in 35 minutes? It's really more superfluous than an actually impactful statistic - the points and assists are great but he's probably not far above average as a defender at his position. That's why you should look at all the advanced stats beyond just PER.

Meanwhile Shai is leading the league in points and is about 12th on the DPOY ladder while playing on a team with a likely unprecedented net rating in this era of basketball. I mean, maybe GSW did it in their hey day, but Shai is the man behind the madness like Curry was for GSW. || I guess then I just disagree with you. In my opinion, Luka did not just have a „great“ season. I know people don’t like counting stats. But his were the best ever, or in a really long time. 

Similar to how Jokic is perhaps in a different league, Luka was last year. But Jokic won. Jokic has gotten enough praise.  || You gotta admit generally when Luka was brought up in MVP discussions for last season it was always as third place because Jokic and Shai were tied for the first seed and the Mavs were a fifth seed so the easy differentiator was “Well Luka doesnt have enough team success” || 1. Jokic did not have an all time season last year, but Luka had.
2. I mentioned this to show that the Mavs were not as weak as the standings said and were injury ridden. It was not meant as an argument for MVP.
3. I am not assuming this, was literally all over the media last season in all ranking discussions for MVPs. I am not assuming anything  or making stuff up here. It was super clear Luka would be Nr.1, but all sites and voters argued the team record is too bad. Many have also discussed that Jokic got it because he was snubbed the year before for Embiid. Are you saying Jokic had a an individually better season than Luka? And SGA too?!? || The offensive load on him is incredible for a non-point guard player. They gave him one dimensional shooters + rim running center + JDub and asked him to get a top 10 offense. There's no real point guard on the roster. Cason Wallace is pretty much a 3-D guard closer to Keon Ellis than a real point guard who can make decisions with the ball in his hands. 

People also have to realize JDub is amazing because of the 2 way potential, but the offense is not amazing or anything. You can still very easily shut him down. He's not yet a great playmaker. He picks up his dribble too much in the paint. He's not athletic enough to just blow by guys. He's shooting 34% from 3 point range this season. There's plenty of games where he just can't perform when the defense focuses in on him. 

Basically SGA does everything for them on offense, while being a top 25 defender in the NBA this season. I can't stress how flawed the OKC roster is on offense. They have 2 guys in total on the roster who can attack a mismatch. They have only 3 guys in total who can pass and dribble with the ball in their hands (SGA, JDub, Caruso) and one of them (Caruso) can't attack a mismatch. || Defense exists.

Jokic is essentially disqualified from having top 10 all time overall seasons with his dreadful defense at his position. || [deleted] || Let me ask you this, to get away from SGA for a second because you brought up something really interesting - how do you feel about OKC's chances for a deep playoff run this year with a flawed offensive roster?  Do you think it will sink them?  Or do you feel this might be an '03 Pistons-type team? || People on this sub read stats not watch games.

Still top 10 in DRB% as well as TRB%, and Jokic is actually 2nd in DBPM behind Shai right now.

On top of that, Jokic literally has the highest single season box plus/minus AND player efficiency rating OF ALL TIME at the moment, to say his fairly decent defense disqualifies him from MVP given these other stats is crazy bias. 

I know you can't always depend on stats to be an accurate representation of what really happens on the court, but when he's in the top ranks of so many different defensive categories ""big man plays bad d, disqualified"" doesn't really hold up. || lmao seriously-- Jokic *obviously* had the best season last year

A strong case could be made that Luka had a better individual season than *Shai* last year but got 3rd because of the team success differential... but Jokic very clearly had the best year || Ugh, I really detest this style of commentary.

There's no argument presented or attempt to deconstruct the other commenter's argument.  It's just a short, thoughtless attack on the commenter with no real response to the content of the comment itself.  Even the (lame, pointless) claim that the other commenter is biased goes unsupported by evidence.

Having a discussion means being willing to engage with what others have to say.  That's not always easy, especially when we realize our original argument wasn't as strong as it might have initially felt.  But one of the values of discussion is that, via exposure to ideas that are unfamiliar or uncomfortable, we might learn something new or have our view changed.  Attacking the person not the argument prevents that.

My hope is that this subreddit can be preserved as a space for discussion, not shitposting. || The offensive flaws are mitigated when Chet comes back- you don't need to work as hard to break down defenses anymore because of the better spacing. 

But you can still see where this team can get shut down offensively- and JDub is the swing piece. Against teams like the Nuggets and Clippers in the playoffs there's gonna be games where JDub doesn't have the juice to get it going. As the 2nd option he's on 55.5TS% right now and it's getting close to chucking here. His length almost works against him because he's not super vertically athletic or explosive. His game is all about muscling and methodical craftiness to get his shot off. But guys like Aaron Gordon, PJ Washington, Kawhi, he's gonna have a lot of problems because they're all stronger and longer than him. In the playoffs he's gonna have to rely on his midrange/3 point shooting a lot more because the lanes are gonna close up on him. If he could actually draw fouls this would be less of a problem but he can't at this point. 

Anyways, even with JDubs weaknesses I still see them getting to the conference finals. Their defense is 4.5 points better than the 2nd place team which is crazy. But in the later rounds when they go up against better teams their ball handling and half court creation ability will get attacked. Like I mentioned the Clippers are a really bad matchup for them I think. 

They're neck and neck with Boston only because Boston is coasting a bit more than last year and Boston is underperforming from a 3 point shooting perspective.

Today, I'd like to know your opinion, what do you value more?

System-Creating Stars: Players who dominate the offense through high usage rates and playmaking (LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Jokic). These players essentially become the offensive system themselves, bending team strategies around their unique skillsets.

System-Dependent Stars: Players who excel within established systems, often through off-ball movement and efficient scoring (Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant). These stars can elevate existing systems to championship levels through their ability to maximize team concepts.

In my opinion, system-dependent stars provide more team-building flexibility and sustainable success. When examining team construction, system-creating stars often require specific roster builds - like how Westbrook needed shooters (OKC peaked with 47.6 TS% as a team when surrounded by athletes), Harden's Rockets required specific role players for his isolation style (Houston built entirely around 3&D players), and even LeBron's teams traditionally need particular archetypes of players to maximize his drive-and-kick game. In contrast, system-dependent stars like Curry (Warriors maintain a 58.2 TS% with various roster iterations), Durant (has excelled in three different systems: OKC, GSW, and Phoenix), and Jordan (thrived both pre and post-triangle) have shown remarkable adaptability to different teammates and schemes while maintaining elite efficiency. This adaptability often makes it easier for front offices to build and maintain competitive rosters around them, as they can succeed with a wider variety of teammate archetypes.

However if we would be talking to guys with the level of Curry and above i feel like the guy is so specialized and so good at what he's good at, that you can and should build a team and system around his skillset, and its going to work great.   
So i would say system dependant stars are generally better than players who create the system.  


I see the Bulls and Warriors as the same team on different eras.

In the Warriors you had Curry as the main offensive weapon, Klay as a backup, Draymond on D and rebounding.

In the bulls you had MJ as the main offensive guy, Pippen as a backup, and Rodman.

  
Sure, the offensive runs different, the players are different (i would say MJ can score in many more ways than Curry, Pippen is probably a worse scorer than Klay was in his prime, but a better defender, and Draymond is similar to Rodman), but the fundamentals are the same.   
You have 1 main guy, and build everything else to adapt to his skills. The main guy is the primary scorer, and has a secondary scorer to drop 15-25 points. A third man focused on defense and rebounding. || [removed] || this is a bad take imo. Stars are the system and not a single star player is system dependent. Harden was great in any system he was just at his best with the ball in his hand. Steph curry is great off ball sure but their best play was always the steph damond pick and roll with him running down the court at full speed handling the ball. Jordan averaged 30 ppg and carried his team to the playoffs long before the triangle offense. the “system dependent” is when a system is implemented around stars that allow the role players to better play with the stars. Stars don’t need systems role players need systems to adapt to the stars. || By your own admission guys like harden and Westbrook needed specific players to have success, I’d argue that’s actually being system dependent. As for Lebron he’s won championships with three different teams three different coaches, a non shooting star guard in Dwayne wade, with two non shooting bigs playing long stretches at the same time in 2020 and playing at the 4 more in Miami than he did in Cleveland. I don’t think that’s system dependent || You need a balance between the system revolving around the stars, for system creating stars injury to the star can completely turn the season upside down, take luka doncic and mavs currently. James harden is also an example, once he was shut down during the playoffs by the opposing defense the offense breaks down. the team needs a system that excels with the star and can function upto an extent without the star. golden state is an example, the systems efficiency of the system is highly dependent on the shooting presence. Better the shooting, better the system, with steph curry the system is at a peak but still can work with average shooters to an extent. Durant I would say is an exception due to his ability to play any systems, any position or any type of game. He would be the most complete player.  
So I would prefer a system which can function without its star (due to injury or when he is shut down by the opposing defense) and excels the best with its star. The best squad I would say consists of a rim protector that can at least shoot free throws, a point guard that can play off the ball if needed and other 3 and D wings among whom at least two can create their own shot and can switch 1 to 4 and at least hold their ground against big large centers until double comes || Jokic has played well with anyone including even Westbrook.

We often have a bias that athletes must look like bodybuilders to be optimal at their jobs. || Trae will always be undersized even compared to an undersized Curry: he is at least an inch shorter (probably 2) and has 2 inches less of wingspan. Getting more muscle wouldn’t solve this and Trae doesn’t seem to be the guy to enjoy physicality like Bane and Brunson, who are also undersized, but use their strength to bully taller and lankier defenders. If both Bane and Brunson wanted to play more finesse style of ball, maybe they could drop a bit of size, but they would need to become even more skilled than they already are.

Zion can’t lose A LOT of weight, that’s just his body type. That said, he could absolutely drop to heavy pre-Miami LBJ weight (250 or so pounds) and that would help his longevity tremendously while he would still maintain physical advantage over anybody in the league.

Simmons doesn’t have any Cs skills to play position full-time: he doesn’t provide much rim protection compared to players of his size and he has next to no footwork and barely any touch to score in the paint. He was at his best as a perimeter stopper capable of defending on switches 1-5 and has always been limited on offense, but if he was to gain weight, he would lose even more ability on defense (won’t keep up with guards at all) while still providing barely any value on offense.

Okongwu is almost the exact opposite: he basically has no skills outside the paint. Playing even PF without ability to drive (let alone without a decent shooting ability) is next to impossible in modern league, especially considering Okongwu is respectable defender on perimeter, but far from defensive stopper.

Trey and Jaden are probably better off as PG clones, but they could theoretically try to get to JJJ size. The thing is, size is not the only thing that matters: JJJ is an excellent inside defender and is a good inside scorer, so Trey and Jaden would need to develop those skills to be effective PFs. Considering where both players are (respectable 3-D players, Trey develops driving game) it’s just easier to catch up to PG in skills.

KD gaining muscle would have probably turned into Giannis: great inside scorer that would have most likely lost most of his outside shooting ability. Do we remember that Giannis shot career best 35% on 3s in his rookies season before starting to bulk up? KD probably wouldn’t be flirting with 40% career shooting on 3s with more muscle.

Luka is an interesting case: yes, he is not dunking or breaking down defenses with his speed like he did in his first 2-3 seasons, but he is overpowering any defender opponents throw at him with his sheer size. He is like a smaller but more skilled as a ball handler Jokic: there is no defender who can reliably stop either 1v1 due to combination of size, weight, vision and skill. I’m not sure shredded Luka would be a better player today: “fat” version can take on physicality and beating inside, though I’m sure less weight would have prolonged his career, similar to Zion. || Caleb Martin being a 6'5, 215 pound pf is suboptimal for sure. I don't think bane can afford to lose much weight if any, part of why he's such a good defender despite having a negative wingspan is that he's hard to bump off and create enough space to get a decent shot off. He loses weight and he'll end up like Tyler herro, able to stay in front of guys but can't contest very well when they bump him back || Looks like Jaylen got jacked this year and he looks stiffer and a little slower and his shooting not as good || Harden is in better shape this year, but he could still stand to be a little leaner I think.  Been that way a lot of his career.  Guess you can’t be that critical given how good he has been.  

Jonas Valanciunas.  His rookie year he was a lot skinnier and more mobile.  Raptors asked him to bulk and he lost a lot of that quickness.   He could probably stand to lose 40 or 50lbs and it would be night and day for him, IMO.  Maybe he loses a little bit of strength, but that wasn’t ever really a big problem even when he was thinner. || I love this question. KD would be very interesting to watch if he had developed into a PF/C instead by adding a tiny bit more muscle. Always wondered how he would play if he was an actual big instead. If he focused on skills near the rim in college, I think he would be an excellent rim protector combined with his shooting touch making him the first unicorn big. || Embiid. If Embiid played his entire career at 240-250 pounds, as the geat bigs of the 80's and 90's did, he'd of had a far more healthy career. Instead, despite putting up some historic scoring numbers, he's played his entire career 40+ lbs too heavy. As a result of that, his strength and conditioning have always been suboptimal. Embiid has never dedicated himself to getting in shape. || I don’t think Zion is operating an optimal body composition.

Bro is holding onto more McDonalds than I’ll eat in a lifetime. || Taking Draymond Green’s body on this one. Skillset doesn’t match his physical metrics. Backpack shot, he’s solid in the paint, but lacks height. Tweener height and a belly on him. He has a handle, while not great, is respectable enough to push the break. He had a better package of offensive go-to’s in college that dissipated when he started playing heavy minutes for the Warriors.

Then again, there are a bunch of pudgy boys who can ball. From the YMCA to the NBA. || [removed] || [removed] || I think about this with OG whenever I watch him play now. I’m sure he was hearing the “able to guard 1-5” conversations and wanted to bulk to be apart of them, but he’s lost a lot of agility and his game just seems way more laborious. They play different roles, but I’m a little worried Jaylen Brown is headed down a similar path || I think Zion Williamson shouldve been forced into more of an on ball role and forced to keep his weight under 270 (really 260).

Zion’s rebounding and rim protection are typically bad for a starting big, but he has really great playmaking, transition, and rim finishing. Let him loose in a transition based, one read, on ball role (think Russell Westbrook/Pre Injury Ben Simmons) and take advantage of teams need to collapse or get out the way when he has a full head of steam. I think Zion Williamson could be a superstar in this league, but from a team building perspective, a hyper athletic on ball player is much easier to build around than a 4 who doesnt have a great jumper or defensive fundamentals. || You also have to consider the immense mental differences in different positions. Of course the sport is moving very position-less but playing centre vs PG are two very different mindsets, let alone physical needs and skillsets || Luka needs to be much leaner- he would be talked about in the same breathe as prime Curry if he was in shape (not invterms of playstyle but impact) . Brunson's build actually suits his playstyle- him and Lowry have that shorter bulldog build that allows them to get to their spots. || I don’t know but I remember Curry bulking up a bit and temporarily losing some of his finishing touch and three point shooting in 2022. || AD is a 4 not a 5.... KD is a 3 not a 4 that's why he lies about his height.... Lakers are idiots for thinking AD can play the 5 still can't believe this is a thing || That’s true, but I’d imagine he’d gained some defensive upside, as well as maybe ability to just not get bullied running offball. 
Plus his role has kinda been a bit of a mess his whole career from playing behind Simmons/Toby, then Harden, Embiid, then 24/7 injuries in the team bounces him everywhere from sole creator to 3rd option to 1st option. 

But you’re right and I’m interested to see his growth. || De'Aaron Fox did something similar a few years ago, or at least that's what the reports said at the time. He put on a bunch of muscle for 21-22 and it hurt his speed. Came back lean and fast the next year and made all-nba. || It’s cause he gained fat, he probably dirty bulked. Once he cuts that fat off and gets shredded he’ll be back to prime Lebron || Hasn't exactly turned out badly for Giannis though.. || Davis is an interesting example I think you could argue either way. If he doesn’t put on the weight his outside shot is likely better, but still not what you want for a 4 in 2025. Conversely his size and position change has led to him developing his touch closer to the basket to a level he easily may not have gotten to

Based on younger ADs potential it’s hard not to assume he should’ve stayed thin, but I think it’s a bigger question mark than some might assume || I seemed to remember Giannis not being a shooting threat early in his career but I might be mistaken. I definitely don't remember a fluid jump shot... || I think Giannis's jump shot is mostly the result of bad coaching. Now that Doc is encouraging him to shoot he's shooting a lot better. || Completely agree, Keegan is in that Herb Jones, Trey Murphy kind of build when he is best suited as a pure wing instead of a 4. I honestly feel like he had to play 4 with arrival of Derozan, who is not a 2 anymore with his lack of burst, but honestly I’d rather Kings prioritised Murray’s development as his rookie season was extremely promising.",0.0,0.886,0.114,0.2023,0.014,0.764,0.222,0.9926,0.09,0.736,0.175,0.9997

# What's being tracked

**Paint-Defense:**

>. A lot of ink has been spilled arguing for it as the singularly most important component of an individual defender’s ability to help his team prevent the other guys from scoring. It’s also an aspect of the game that is poorly quantified, especially pre-data ball. Blocks are by and large the primary measure people use, but a look at usage (**rim-load**, measured by **PPs (Primary Protections))** reveals that even players who offer very little rim-protection can be made to look like centerpieces if one limits their evaluation to counting how often contact is made with the ball:

>**EPP - Effective primary protections -** This is when a PP is deemed effective  
**IPP - Ineffective Primary Protections -** This is when a PP is deemed ineffective

**Perimeter Defense:**

>**PPDs** \- Primary Perimeter defendings - This credits a player as the primary or co-primary perimeter defender for a possession  
  
**EPPD** \- Effective Primary Perimeter defendings - When a PPD is deemed effective  
**IPPD** \- Ineffective Primary Perimeter defendings - When a PPD is deemed ineffective

**General Deterrence**

>That said, I think rim-load has a glaring blind-spot. What if the reason a player is used as a paint-protector…because the opponent wants them to be used as one?  
  
Corzine and Oakley both were the primary or co-primary paint protectors on a boatload of possessions above. But is Corzine’s relativity to Oakley there the Bull’s doing, or their own? Jokic spends alot of time defending the paint, even compared to other bigs. Is he a great rim-protector? Or is he just being hunted by opposing offenses?  
  
To answer these queries, I present the latest product of Eye-Test, Inc:  
  
**Irrational Avoidances (IA).**  
  
The following conditions must be met to rack up an Irrational Avoidance…  
  
1) More of your team’s defenders are on the opposing side of the floor for a sequence (There can be multiple sequences per possession)  
2) Despite this the attacker/attacking team chooses to attack the side with more defenders  
3) This decision is made after a reset or in the half-court/semi-transition  
  
Note, “the floor” here really describes the area of space a set of defenders covers, not the literal floor. Additionally the sides are determined using the vantage point of the initial ball-handler. If you can imagine a symmetric line being drawn from the ball-handler’s POV to the basket…being to the left or right of said line determines what side you’re on. I will also exclusively look at how a sequence starts.  
  
A “sequence” ends whenever there is a pause in the ball-handlers movement or the possession finishes.

# Intro

Guards generally struggle to showcase significant defensive impact. Even the ones racking up blocks and steals and DPOYs:

>*Jordan*  
**88-98**  
\+1.1 drtg difference  
**90-99**  
\+0.2 drtg difference  
**85-98**  
\-1.1 drtg difference  
**84-99**  
\-.5 drtg difference

>*Wade*  
**2004-2014**  
\-.1 drtg difference  
**2006-2011**  
\-.3 drtg difference  
**2005-2016**  
\-.4 drtg difference

“Generally” because there’s at least one exception:

>*Jason Kidd*  
**1997-2001**  
\-3.6 drtg differrence  
**2002-2008**  
\-6.8 drtg difference  
**2008-2012**  
\-.1 drtg difference

Why is Kidd’s data so good? He barely collects blocks and he gets steals at a lower clip than the first two. Well, a hypothesis was presented in the ongoing retro player of the year project:

>Finally there’s Kidd. The best ever defensive guard? 204. 6’4, **He’s strong and stout which means when attackers are thinking of driving he spooks them alot more often than a jumpy shotblocker like Jordan or Wade.** He’s a mini-duncan in a way. On time, at the right place at the right time in the right way. He just knows where he needs to be and why he needs to be there. And he knos where the others need to be and makes sure they get there too.

Jason Kidd, 6’4, averaging 0.3 blocks a game is a better paint-protector than taller, if lankier, block accumulators? He weighs more so “strong and stout” makes sense but thus far no guard has even crossed 4 per 40-possession in any of the tracking with the most PPs for a tracked game coming to Jordan in 1988 vs the Knicks when he recorded 3 (the record is 5 by 6’8 Reid in the 86 finals if one considers him an SG)

Blocks don’t seem to [correlate that strongly with usage thus far](https://forums.realgm.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=2421706):  
  
But height does. Is Kidd’s stoutness and strength really enough here?  
  
To start to answer this we’ll look at the film. Specifically the first 40 possessions of game 6 of the 2003 Finals where Kidd anchored his team within 2 games of an inaugural nba championship. Fwiw, in the game tracked, Kidd recorded 1 steal, 2 defensive rebounds, and 0 blocks:

This can get subjective so any peer-review is welcomed (I've posted time-stamps)

**Possession 2** \- 2:09  
  
Pretty much the same as 1.  
  
**Possession 3** \- 2:28  
  
~~Kidd~~Slay is one of two defenders to start the possession in the paint and then holds off Duncan on an island with no one behind for several seconds. ~~Kidd~~ Slay then swipes at a driving Bowen without fouling or stripping, does the bulk of the work preventing Duncan from challenging for a rebound, challenges Robinson. He’s also the defender closest to the basket on the inbound.

Hangs at the elbow.  
  
**Possession 11** \- 8:20  
  
Deters an inside pass from manu, stays with manu a bit pressuring him to pass it off, seals a man to help with the rebound. He can get pro-primary perimeter credit here.

**Possession 12** \- 9:20  
  
Tracks Manu for a bit, spends a little time under the basket.

**Possession 14** \- 10:12  
  
Tracks a man off-ball.  
  
**Possession 15** \- 11:30  
  
Chases Stephen Jackson on the fastbreak and runs into Manu fouling him. Doesn’t seem like Manu was in great position to score regardless.  
  
(Kidd - 3 PPD, 1 IPPD)  
  
**Possession 16** \- 12:45  
  
Picks up Tony Parker, gets caught on a screen from Duncan, contests late.  
  
(Kidd - 4 PPD, 2 IPPD)  
  
**Possession 17** \- 13:10  
  
Kidd gets his first IA (1) with Parker using a screen to go on the more crowded side of the court. Kidd fights around it to stay attached and Parker passes it off. Kidd is about to catch the ball off a miss but his teammate tips it to Duncan who fires right as Kidd enters his vicinity.  
  
(Kidd - 5 PPD, 2 EPPD)  
  
**Possession 18** \- 14:35  
  
Kidd tracks a very active Parker off-ball, helps on Duncan who throws it to Manu who throws it to Jackson as Kidd moves towards him. Then Kidd contests Jackson well and Jackson misses.  
  
(Kidd - 6 PPD, 3 EPPD)  
  
**Possession 19** \- 15:20  
  
Kidd tracks his man.  
  
**Possession 20** \- 17:00  
  
Rockets turnover with Hakeem up the court. Waves his hands to try and stop a long lob but the ball finds its recipient and Houston loses the 2 v 1.

**Possession 25** \- 31:07  
  
Kidd hangs by the paint.  
  
**Possession 26** \- 31:14  
  
Kidd watches as San Antonio quickly squanders an extra possession.  
  
**Possession 27** \- 31:52  
  
Kidd rotates near the basket where he is –technically– the last line of defense for the most critical part of the possession. I say technically because he backs away on Duncan’s second go at the basket and Duncan gets both the bucket and free-throws.  
  
(Kidd - 3 PP, 1 IPP)  
  
**Possession 28** \- 33:50  
  
Kidd comes up to meet Jackson with the ball. Jackson passes off but there’s a foul. Kidd is closest to the inbounder and picks him up when he gets the ball back.

Kidd inches towards Robinson as he drives to “help” but Robinson just goes right by him and scores on two defenders.  
  
**Possession 31** \- 36:54  
  
Kidd starts the possession as the backline defender and then comes out to the perimeter to contain Manu then shuffles back near the basket for a potential rebound that never comes.

Kidd picks up Manu who passes it off.  
  
Possession **36** \- 42:05  
  
Kidd watches a man in the corner then comes inside to help intercept Parker who passes it off to Bowen. Kidd moves towards Bowen, who shot 40% from 3 all season, but is too late to do anything. Bowen misses.  
  
Possession **37** \- 43:26  
  
Kidd watches his man at the elbow.  
   
Possession **38** \- 43:50

\-> 1 IPPs  
\-> 2 IAs

**Perimeter Defense:**

>\-> 10 PPDs  
\-> 6 EPPDs  
\-> 3 IPPDs

During Kidd’s first 40 possessions, I gave him, **3** possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in **1** and ineffective in **1**. Kidd was also given **10** possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in **6** and ineffective in **3**. Additionally Kidd was given **2** Irrational Avoidances. This means per possession, Kidd averaged, **0.075 PPs, 0.025 EPPs, 0.025 IPPs, 0.25 PPDs, 0.15 EPPDs, 0.075 IPPDs, and 0.05 IAs.**  
  
The only big all these inputs have been tracked for is **97 Hakeem** (Game 6, WCF). During Hakeem’s first 40 possessions of the 6th game of the 97 WCF, I gave him **27** possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in **13** and ineffective in **7**. Hakeem also was given **4** possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in 3 and ineffective in **1**. Additionally Hakeem was given **4** Irrational Avoidances. This means per Possession, Hakeem averaged, **0.675 PPs, 0.325 EPPs, 0.175 IPPs, 0.1 PPDs, 0.075 EPPDs, 0.025 IPPDs, and 0.1 IAs.**

The only wing all these inputs have been tracked for is **2007 Lebron** (Game 1, Finals). During Lebron’s first 40 possessions, I gave him, **5** possessions as a primary or co-primary rim-protector of which he was deemed effective in **3** and ineffective in **1**. Lebron also was given **16** possessions as a primary or co–primary perimeter defender, of which he was deemed effective in **9** and ineffective in **3**. Additionally, Lebron was given **9** Irrational Avoidances. This means per Possession, Lebron averaged, **0.125 PPs, 0.075 EPPs, 0.025 IPPs, 0.4 PPDs, 0.225 EPPDs, 0.075 IPPDs, and 0.225 IAs.**

  
The only other guards to have their PPs counted are Micheal Jordan, Sam Vinceint, and BJ Armstrong. Jordan tallied **3** PPs in the first 40 possessions of game 3 of the 1988 ECSF between New York and Chicago. Sam Vincient tallied **2**. Jordan tallied **1** PP in the first 40 possessions of the 4th game of the 1991 ECF. Armstrong also tallied **1**.  
  
For a comparison to wings(over the first 40 defensive possessions for their respective teams), Oakley, Pippen, and Grant tallied **13, 8, and 6** PPs respectively in the aforementioned 88 game. In the aforementioned 91 game, Pippen and Grant had **14 PPs** each. In the final game of the 94 ECSF between New York and Chicago, Oakley and Pippen tallied **15 PPs** and Grant tallied **7**. In the 86 Finals, Reid tallied **5.**  
  
For Bigs, Over 37 possessions Duncan(99 finals, game 1) averaged **.57 PPs, 0.16 EPPs, 0.11 IPPs, and 0.03 IAs.** Over 31 possessions Robinson(99 finals, game 1) averaged **0.58 PPs, 0.26 EPPs, 0.13 IPPs. 0.032 IAs.** Over 22 Possessions in the final game of the 94 ECSF vs Chicago, **Ewing had 13 PPs and 3 IAs giving him, per possession, .59 PPs and 1.4 IAs.**

  
Kidd , perhaps unsurprisingly, has much more perimeter usage than Olajuwon. On the other hand, Lebron does better than Kidd across-the-board with more effective usage on both the perimeter and interior, more positive usage on both the perimeter, and the interior, and less ineffective usage on both the perimeter and usage. I noted there were 2 other possessions I’d credit Kidd as the secondary paint-protector but there are at least three additional ones I’d count that for Lebron. He and Lebron are dwarfed by Hakeem in terms of paint-tracking. Kidd in paticularly is dwarfed by pretty much all the bigs and wings with the exception of Reid whose usage was mostly a result of something going wrong for the Rockets. Presuming this sample is representative, I am doutful an outlier-y paint-presencer is explaining anything on it’s own. I would say he spends a bunch of possessions near where the action is happening and it’s possible their is an unusual effect that would be captured if i tracked tertiary usage, but even then, Kidd seems mostly a non-factor when called upon. He was a true backline defender once on a rotation and while he seemed to almost become one momentarily three other times, him just backing away repeatedly in a position to theoretically help makes me skeptical that over a larger sample he would be emulating wings there. I also think 2 of the PPs were borderline but given what I counted for Jordan in 88 (2 possessions where he happened to be under the basket with the possession almost immediately ending) I think it would be inconsistent not to see him as at least a co-primary in terms of paint usage,

I would hope this is not a surprise…

but a low steal count didn’t predict low or ineffective usage with Kidd more frequently guarding or helping than anyone else on the team and doing so effectively. This all-or-nothing system might undersell Kidd since he spent a few possessions splitting usage on the perimeter with usage as tertiary paint deterrent. Roamers in general may be a bit disadvantaged with my approach and Kidd looks like one.

Still being a mini-pippen doesn’t really explain having much better signals than Pippen. Maybe something easily observable will emerge as the sample is (hopefully) added to/vetted to, but if the unusually strong *and consistent* correlation Kidd has with team defense is not merely noise, it may be more a matter of brain than brawn. Unfortunately I, and seemingly no one, has come up with a system to “track” defensive quarterbacking. I would also expect Kidd to benefit if “secondary” usage inputs were added.  
  
I'll finish by copy and pasting some caveats with IAs (irrational avoidances):

>**Mobile defenders render avoidance pointless**  
  
For an IA to occur, a player must decide to face more defenders rather than a particular defender. If the defender being avoided is excellent at covering ground, going tgrough a more crowded route may be less likely to offer you the avoidance you seek.  
  
**Good defensive teammates hurt**

>  
If you are wary of defenders on the side opposite to the player as well, is it worth shifting?  
  
It’s possible the ideal scenario for IA accumulation is one where a player isn’t timely or capable of help and is surrounded by terrible rim-protectors.

I wish there were a less time consuming, manual method of this kind of tracking.

One clarification on EPP(D) and IPP(D) - what determines “effectiveness?” Does forcing a low percentage shot that happens to go in counted as effective or ineffective? || Not to derail or be dramatic, but defense is important enough to the bottom line that if you swapped Kidd and Trae Young the Hawks would be a much better team. 

That's not a knock on Trae or his talents, he's amazing. || Thanks for the kind words!

He not only continued to play at a high level, he also has looked better since the season started & with the All-Star reserves coming out tomorrow, I thought it'd be fun to go through his case for it & see where other fanbases also stand here(I'm a Heat fan).

Right now, he's averaging 25/5/6 per 75 possessions on 58% eFG & 62% TS. The only players that matched are Shai, Giannis, Jokic & Curry.

Starting with the impact metrics(EPM by Dunks and Threes; LEBRON by BBall-Index; DPM by Darko; eRAPTOR by Neil Paine), he ranks:  
\- 18th in expected O-EPM with +3.5  
\- 9th in actual O-EPM with +4.2  
\- 17th in O-LEBRON with +2.5  
\- 35th in O-DPM with +2.0  
\- 18th in O-eRAPTOR with +3.5

He ticks off the having good production, elite efficiency(especially given the volume, responsibility, role AND team context), and he also has the advanced metrics in his favour, too.

By all but 1 metric, he's ranked in the top 20 on offense.

Also, do note that I'm focusing on the offensive side. Defensive metrics haven't liked him at all this year(for some, it's the worst in his career). But that matters less to me for things like the All-Star game. This isn't about who's better or who would you rather have on a contending team, where more factors come into play.

What simply matters is what is the job/role for that player in their context & how well are they doing it. What does the team need from that said player & has that player done what they needed them to do?

For Herro, it's an easy yes & he's done it extremely well

He's been their engine offensively. You can see in the tracking/usage stats where he ranks on the team. He's been tasked with a lot of responsibility, both as on/off ball scorer, ball handler, passer & help with spacing/shooting. The offense also revolves around his skillset.

Here's a [link to his tracking & usage stats](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-60ewy0xz2yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1807%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De84c5022f0335573f1aeb2c24a8ab3f18a57a0e9) per BBall-Index compared to everyone on the Heat. Leads the team in touches per 75, ball dominance, offensive involvement rate, on-ball action are, true usage, and scoring possessions per 75. 

Even when looking at just the playtypes(PNR/ISO/Post ups/Handoffs), he ranks first by a good margin:

\- Herro: 10.4  
\- Butler: 6.2  
\- Rozier: 5.1  
\- Bam: 4.9

Herro has been doing it all for the Heat. That's a lot of offense going through him & actions directly involving him to score and yet, he's still putting up highly efficient numbers across the board.

The Heat's offensive rating with him on is 115.5 but take him off & it drops to 107.8 - that's the difference between 10th & 29th. Even in this stretch where the Heat's offense had significantly dropped for the year, he still drags it. In 2025, it's 114.1 with vs 106.8 without.

We also seen his production without Butler. In 20 games without Butler, Herro averages 25pts per 75 poss on 57% eFG & 61% TS with 28% usage. His stats & efficiency don't differ. & those points have been needed a lot. When games are in the mud(they have been a lot lately), you'll take any scoring you can get.

Per Cleaning the Glass, the offense is in the 71st percentile with him on and his on/off is in the 96th(!) percentile. Clear impact on the offensive end.

That's third box ticked for me.

Moving onto the ""eye test""(how he does it) and basketball.

Starting off with his shooting. That has been the biggest difference & it comes down to a change in shot diet & upping the 3pt rate. He's an *elite* shooter. He's 12th in 3pt attempts per 100 at 13.5 & shoots 40.5%. Out of 59 qualifying players with 10 3s, he's 13th in %.

Per BBall-Index shooting metrics, he ranks:

\- 7th in 3pt shooting talent  
\- 7th in 3pt pull up talent  
\- 9th in C&S 3pt talent  
\- 1st in deep 3pt talent

\- 2nd in 3pt shot making  
\- 6th in 3pt pull up shot making  
\- 5th in C&S 3pt shot making  
\- 1st in deep 3pt shot making

It's this change in his shot diet for more 3s that got him the 10th highest TS% increase over a single season since 2014, amongst on-ball guards. This year, it was the second highest behind Garland.

He went from a 45.3% 3pt rate to 55.0%. A 10% increase leaning on a skill that he's been *elite* at for the last few years.

He's the only player to rank top 10 in both 3pt pull up & C&S 3pt talent. Deadly on or off ball. There are also only 8 players to rank top 25 in 3pt shot making, pull up shot making & C&S shot making.

& it's that ability to do so in various ways. He can simply be a spot up shooter, helping with the spacing & making him a dangerous off-ball player. He shoots 48% on wide open 3s + 44% on corners. You CAN'T leave him open. His spacing & gravity helps & makes life easier.

[Here's a link to his C&S 3pt & off-ball video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580807857070146)

That off-ball ability & gravity also turns into this. There are multiple instances where he makes the defense panic if comes off a screen or even looks like he's about to go for a 3pt. That's the level of a shooter that he is. This helps with any off-ball movement run for him

[Here's a link to his gravity video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580809929089386)

But it's the handoff + off the dribble where the scoring has taken a jump - he does take 10 PNRs + handoffs combined. Being able to create space for 3s off dribble or off handoffs adds unpredictability. It makes defense have to over play him & he can still get a 3 off in other ways.

[Here's a link to his off dribble 3s video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580812005204320)

That's why his efficiency looks like this. Per BBall-index, his stable PPP:

\- 1.12 points on handoffs  
\- 1.18 on spot ups  
\- 1.24 in transition  
\- 1.10 on off ball screen  
\- 0.94 in PNR

Only 6 other players score at least 1.0 PPP in the first four & 0.9 in the PNR - Dame/Shai/Haliburton/Powell/Pritchard/Edwards

What this all led to is an improvement inside & everywhere else(including his passing). 1st, he took away his inefficient mid-ranges. He's now also shooting 63% within 4ft & 54% within 4-14ft. Out of 64 players with at least 20 2pt per 100, he's 13th in %

The biggest difference is the driving ability & creating off dribble. There's a DRASTIC difference in how aggressive he looks + how he embraced going through contact. There have also been more counters + better moves to shift & get open then burst to the rim.

That's why there's now a more willingness to attack & get to the rim. His rim rate is at 17%(2nd highest in career) - a big improvement from 11% & 13% the last 2 years. Combine that with the shooting, this has been as best of a 3 level scoring season he's ever had

[Here's a link to his drives video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884583295725216122)

What's also been better is the passing & playmaking. That has taken a significant step from last year & has been as big of a difference maker in his impact as everything stated above. This was another major flaw/weakness & it simply isn't like that anymore

Some stats per BBall-Index amongst 93 on-ball players:

\- 23rd in playmaking talent

\- 24th in passing creation quality

\- 21st in box creation

\- 16th in P&R creation rate

There's been a clear increase in volume + responsibility as a passer & that was a needed thing to learn how to balance that with the scoring.

And when you compare him to himself, that's also where you see the drastic improvement. [Here's a link to his tracking passing stats over the last three years](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-ns8j3sx15yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D735%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De2e6168f4471a0a51d010be42925096be56ea87d)!

[Here's a link to his passing off drives & PNR video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884587337503383633)

This is where you see the improved decision making. He's been reading the defense a lot better. And with him being a more willing driver + more aggressive, these windows open up a lot more.

This also has led to him being way more blitzed and the results were better than expected.

[Here's a link to 6 min of him getting blitzed video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884587341236339164)

Finally, let's also touch on the competition. His comp for the 2 backup guards: Cade/Dame/Garland/Ball/Trae/Haliburton/LaVine

[Here are the metrics for all of them.](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-a53owp3n5yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D812%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D65d771e844f1b86ec3d1264f56ab51ca6c8f07e2)

Herro ranks: 5th, tied 4th, 6th, tied 4th, tied 6th, 5th, and 5th

I'd take Herro over Cade & LaVine. & I'd take Garland over Herro 100%. There's little argument for me for either option.

That leaves Hali/Dame/Ball/Trae. All have strong cases over one another & it just depends on preference + what you value more. For me, he is cut short based on the competition with Garland + either Dame/Hali over him. But that also changes nothing about his season.

HE is an All-Star calibre player. He HAS played like an All-Star. With the improvements that he made & how it all has translated for this season, especially considering the circumstances & the situation, he has taken huge steps & growth.

**So, to answer the question, he has played like an All-Star this year**

**Let me know your thoughts on his case & if you have him over these guards too!

The Heat have a better record than the Pistons and Hawks, with Herro also being guarded tightly and being leagues above Cade and Trae in scoring 62.2% TS for Tyler vs 54.7% and 55.8% for Young and Cunningham whilst being a good playmaker himself. 

Herro’s stats are similar to Dame, but I give the edge to Herro based on the fact that his team are only three games behind the Bucks while Dame doesn’t have the attention of a first option the other guys do.

LaMelo I don’t think is worth consideration. || He is but there’s like 8 guards that’s are deserving this year which is irritating because the East frontcourt players have been lacking this season. Someone like Jaylen Brown will get an All-Star spot not because he’s played like one but because there isn’t a deep selection of players he’s competing with unlike Herro. || [removed] || When you look at his numbers and the whole butler situation, it feels like he deserves it because now he’s getting the full attention as a number one too. Yet I doubt he finds a spot with the amazing guard play in the east || Herro is playing really well and I would say he is near all star level.  Dame, Young, will be above him.  With the Drama surrounding Butler the coaches will probably take Maxey, Cade, Haliburton or Ball over him as well.  They might also lump Brown in as a guard.

I would put him at near all star and not all star play.  His points are good 24 PPG but not great 25+ or amazing 30+ and his assists are fairly weak at 5.4. He is having a great season and is significantly improved, but he has not been a top 5-6 guard in the East.  Doesn’t mean he isn’t very good though

Edited PPG from typo || I will have to say I was wrong.  I didn’t think Herro would make the.  Congrats to him || My WIGGA Tyler Herro is one of the best pure scorers we’ve ever seen play basketball. His aura is unmatched. || [removed] || [removed] || I'd have him in my wildcard because the east front court is full of undeserving players imo for the wildcards. Especially with how the hawks will be, idk if Trae will make it even though he does deserve it for how insane his playmaking has been.  Main completion is garland, Cade, dame. 


Hali does not deserve it AT ALL no arguments can be made for him imo, his team is playing better because of their defense bye isn't contributing that much too anyways. Ball is hurt, again, and team sucks so those 2 should get him out. I think dame will get in by being dame (not saying my opinion here) so that just leaves maxey and herro and I think herro is more deserving especially since maxey is inefficient || Hero is okay player. No Heat player should be on the All Star team. Heat is sitting at the 7th spot. .500 teams need to focus on winning not sending players to screw off on All Star weekend.
Heat has done Butler wrong! || The Heat also have had the luxury of having Bam and Jimmy (distraction for most of the season)- which is why they have a better record than the Pistons. And the Pistons have beat them twice already.  || Hey. I don’t think his stats are comparable to Damian Lillard. As a second option, Dame is still drawing noticeably more attention than hero (check gravity measurements) and still putting up noticeably higher points per game and assists numbers. Im not really sure your point about them being down by three games and that correlating to herro being better. I do but it’s a very odd point to make.

I strongly disagree. || cade clears. he’s ahead of him in every single stat while having 0 help on his team. this is the same team that was the worse team i. the league and. one of the worst teams ever. and he turned them into a playoff contender. there team records are almost identical so that’s a non factor. cade also draws way more attention than him since his second option is jaden ivey compared to bam adebayo. i also think dame is slightly better but it’s really close and it’s just an opinion thing || Brown is also a proven commodity || Our sub is for in-depth discussion. Low-effort comments or stating opinions as facts are not permitted. Please support your opinions with well-reasoned arguments, including stats and facts as applicable. || Huh? He's averaging 24ppg not 22 and 5.4 assists is great for a natural off guard that shoots a ton. If u watch the games he's being forced to pass early since double teams come as soon as he crosses the half court line. He's also an elite rebounder for his position 

He may or may not be an allstar but it's crazy to say he hasn't played at an all star lvl || Maxey? Lol 

Herro is averaging 24ppg on 62.2% TS. Trae and averaging 55.8% TS and Cade 54.7% TS.

Thanks! || cade dame and garland all deserve those spots over him || Jimmy has missed half the season and even actively sandbagged. He’s added a ton of drama with multiple suspensions, which has led to him being suspended. Clearly not a net positive overall

The Pistons did beat us twice. Interestingly enough in one of the two games Miami lost, Herro went 40/5/8 with 1 turnover on 72% Ts compared to Cade’s 21/7/9 with 7 turnovers on 58% TS - highlighting that even when Herro played better than Cade, thr results may not reflect it. || Jimmy hasnt played this season so calling that a luxury is hilarious, not to mention how putrid Bam has been on offense, teams literally don't guard bam. You should check out some Heat games to get a better look at Herro imo || - Dame 25/5/7 62% TS
- Herro 24/6/5 62% TS

Pretty comparable numbers in my view. Herro is a first option though, so I give him more credit. I wouldn’t say a ppg difference of 1.2ppg is noticeably higher.

I think being a 48 win pace team is quite an underachievement for an All Star playing with a multiple time MVP in their prime, so I don’t give too much credit there. || Bam isn’t a very good offensive player, he’s not much better than Jarrett Allen.

[OC Analysis],"*Hi folks -- apologies for the length, I thought this would end up being shorter than it ended up being. Hope you enjoy!*

As we fully and truly enter the NBA’s efficiency era, one thing that gets tricky to talk about are the efficiency numbers of past NBA greats. The league average True Shooting Percentage (which takes 3-pointers and free throws into account) this season is 57.4%. That’s an unbelievably high mark compared to past years. In 2014-15, the league average TS% was at 53.4%, and in 03-04, the last year before the hand-check rule change, it was down at 51.6%. 

As stated above, this can make talking about past greats tough. Kobe’s career True Shooting is at 55.0%. In the 05-06 season where he averaged 35.4 points and infamously lost a close race with LeBron for the MVP to Steve Nash, his True Shooting was 55.9%, which would put him among the bottom third of NBA teams. MJ’s career TS% was 56.9%. In 1997-98, he won MVP with a TS% of 53.3% – the Wizards’ current TS% of 54.0 is the worst in the league. Kareem was hyper-efficient during his career, with a TS% of 59.2%, but even that doesn’t match Kenny Atkinson’s Cavs and their 61.4% True Shooting this season. In short, it was really, really hard for players who didn’t shoot a lot of threes to match the efficiency of players who do, especially if they relied heavily on midrange shots – that extra point just matters so much. 

(Tangent: to illustrate this, I got curious last week and ran the numbers on LeBron and Kobe’s career points per jump shot. I went onto basketball-reference and multiplied their career FGAs by % of shots taken from 10-15 feet and 16-23 feet to get the data on their midrange jumpers – since they work in percentages, there were decimal points where there shouldn’t have been and the results may therefore be off by a percentage point or two. 

Still, here’s the breakdown. Kobe took 4,506 shots \[again, give or take one or two\] from 10-15 feet, and made 41.1% of them. He took 7,100 shots from 16-23 feet, and made 40.2% of them. He shot 1827-5546 from three-point range. That’s 14,894 points on 17,153 shots, or .874 points per shot – that comes out to an eFG% of 43.42%. 

LeBron, as of January 21st, 2025, had taken 2,875 shots from 10-15 feet and made 36.8% of them. He took 5,451 shots from 16-23 feet, making 38.6% of them. He had shot 2,492-7,130 from 3-point range. That’s 13,800 points on 15,457 shots, which comes out to .892 points per shot, an eFG% of 44.6%. 

So Kobe, a virtuosic midrange shooter capable of hitting shot after shot over every coverage imaginable, loses out efficiency-wise to LeBron because LeBron, despite having an iffy midrange shot for a lot of his career, took a considerably higher rate of 3s and made them at a slightly higher clip. “Objectively,” I have very little doubt in my mind that Kobe was a better shooter than LeBron – heck, you can see that at the free throw line – but the power of that extra point is undeniable. 

Also, even though LeBron’s shot diet was more “modern” than Kobe’s, all those years taking so many mid-range shots still drags him down compared to the current jump shot diet – if you shoot 29.73% from 3-point range and don’t take any from the midrange, you’re clearing LeBron’s career efficiency on shots outside of 10 feet.) 

Sorry, that was a long tangent. I kinda feel like “LeBron has been more efficient on shots outside of 10 feet than Kobe” was too inflammatory to live on its own, so I hid it in here. Anyways, I want to get to the bottom of my feelings about viewing historic greats through a modern efficiency lens through three takes – a good one, a “maybe” one, and an iffy one. To start, let’s talk about Tetris. 

**Part 1: Larry Bird and Tetris Innovation**

The first take we’ll look at is one I think is fair – Larry Bird, despite having 3-point numbers that pale in comparison to those of modern players, should be considered a great 3-point shooter, and it’s totally fair to assume he would have made threes at a much higher volume if he’d played in a later era. 

I’m [running a bit counter to JJ Redick here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK_Bq-gxQQU), even though I loved JJ Redick as a member of the media and don’t think he was “wrong,” per se, when he called out Bird’s standing as a potential top-5 three-point shooter. Yes, Larry Bird only made 649 career threes – Steph Curry made 402 in the 15-16 season alone. Yes, he shot 71-276 (25.7%) from deep between 1980 and 1984. He’s 184th all-time in three-point percentage, and not close to the top 250 for 3-pointers made. And yes, [he wasn’t working quite as hard to get his looks from 3-point range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eee2TkiclIM) as players do today. However, context matters, and this is where Tetris comes into play. 

For years and years, Jonas Neubauer stood as Tetris’ undisputed GOAT. He won the Classic Tetris World Championship 7 times between 2010 and 2017, and was runner-up in 2014 and 2018. He claimed to be the first player ever to achieve a “max-out” score of 999,999 (there is some controversy surrounding this), and in 2018 set the record with a high score of 1,245,200. 

However, despite his obvious mastery of a game that came out in 1989, there was something very important Jonas didn’t know about Tetris. So far as Jonas or anyone else knew, it was only possible to go so far in a game of Tetris before the “kill screen” – the pieces would move so fast it was physically impossible to maneuver them, and the game would end shortly after a player reached level 29 and the speed of the pieces doubled. 

As it turns out, however, it wasn’t impossible – it was just impossible for Jonas. He, like everyone else, believed the fastest way to move a piece was to hold the button down. When you do that, the built-in lag is too strong for anyone to play at the speeds required for level 29. In 2018, it became widely known that you can “hypertap” the controller to get around that lag and play past level 29, and in 2020 players figured out a way to roll the controller in their hands to achieve ludicrous speeds previously thought literally impossible. 

When players figured that out, Jonas’ records got absolutely demolished. Players were able to reach levels in the hundreds, one (“Blue Scuti”) got to level 157 and made the game crash, and, in October of 2024, a player (“dogplayingtetris”) on a crash-resistant version of the game got past level 255 and reached “rebirth,” when the game starts itself over again. The current Tetris high-score record stands at 16,700,760 points. ([The modern history of Tetris is fascinating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOJlg8g8_yw).) 

Here’s the point: I don’t take anything away from Jonas for not knowing about hypertapping. When players who have gotten scores beyond anything Jonas could have dreamed of face each other at the CWTC now, they play for the Jonas Neubauer trophy, and that’s how it should be. And just like we shouldn’t hold Jonas responsible for playing before anyone knew the power of hypertapping, we shouldn’t hold Larry Bird responsible for playing before anyone truly knew the power of the three-point shot. (Yes, “maybe we should take the jump shot that counts for 50% more points” is perhaps a shorter intuitive leap than “let’s see what happens if I mash the absolute crap out of a button on a controller that hasn’t been widely used for two decades,” but that’s besides the point.) 

When Larry Bird played, he used the three-point line as much as anyone thought it was possible to. It was introduced to the NBA in Bird’s rookie year, and averaging approximately one made three per game functioned as the NBA’s version of level 29 – go any further than that, and an efficiency “kill screen” was thought to be inevitable. Larry led the league in 3s made twice and shot better than 40% from deep six times. When they held the first-ever three-point contest, Larry won it by getting 73.33% of the possible points – when Curry won the contest in 2021, he got 70% of the possible points. After that, Bird won the next two contests. 

Relative league stats also help show just how far ahead of his time Bird was – his career 3P+ (his field goal percentage relative to the league, with 100 being average) was 127, higher than Curry’s career mark of 119. His 3Pr+, his rate of threes relative to the league, was a mind-bending 227. (Again, for comparison, Curry’s is at “only” 165.) That’s not to say Bird was a better shooter than Curry – league-relative stats aren’t a magic bullet, and they can underrate current players, who are playing extremely close to the efficiency “ceiling.” It used to be possible to ""hack"" your way to great relative efficiency by cutting midrange shots out -- [I wrote about it when Kevin Martin did it all the way back in 2009.](https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/6923/kevin-martin-the-adam-dunn-of-the-nba) Now that everyone has a much better shot diet, those edges are a lot harder to find. However, Bird was a shooting Bonjwa, he deserves his flowers as one of the best of all time, and it’s totally fair to imagine he would have drained a lot more threes in a later era. Now let’s get a bit trickier. 

**Part 2: Kevin Garnett and the Ship of Theseus** 

The second take (“thesis statement,” if you prefer to be fancy) we’ll examine is “Kevin Garnett would have been a ton better in the modern era,” which I actually have mixed feelings about. 

I’ve said before that Kevin Garnett was tragically ahead of his time, and it would have been amazing to see what he would have done now, when big men have so much more freedom to make plays and shoot from distance. Despite a great stroke, Garnett spotted up from 20 feet away, because that’s where even “stretchy” four-men were supposed to stand. Despite all his skill with the ball, he spent much of his prime toiling away in the efficiency desert of the mid-post. In his MVP season, where he was doing most of his work from that area, his True Shooting was 54.7% – only the Pelicans, Hornets, Magic, and Wizards are posting a worse mark than than this season. In the 07-08 season, a full 57% of his shots were from midrange, and 36.5% were from 16-23 feet. Even though he knocked those shots down at a spectacular rate, hitting 48.8% from 10-15 feet and 48.2% from 16-23 feet, those shots would have been better-taken if he had been willing/allowed/expected to step behind the line and hit just a third of them. 

It’s easy to say that the guy who took the entire 2000 Olympic team in one-on-ones should have been allowed to show the full volume of his skill in a more spread-out offense, and it probably would have looked a lot better on the stat sheet. But would that have actually made Garnett a better player, or more fun to watch. Yes, those mid-post possessions were inefficient compared to what modern offenses do, but everyone was doing it at the time, and KG was really, really good at it. Those long twos helped his team win a championship. (The Celtics and Lakers meeting in the finals on the backs of midrange masters with the Seven Seconds or Less Suns and the Beautiful Game Spurs laying the foundation for what the league would become was a real “John Henry beats the Steam Shovel” moment in NBA history.)

I think sometimes about if Kevin Durant would have been more effective in an old “meta” where the mid-range was king. He certainly doesn’t have trouble scoring efficiently in the spaced-out NBA, but his accuracy from midrange and ability to get a midrange shot from his spot whenever he wants it is almost unmatched in league history. It’s easy to say everyone taking midrange shots instead of 3s was running a marathon with a lead backpack on from an efficiency standpoint, but what does it do to the guys who are great at adjusting to the weight of that backpack? 

Also, the Ship of Theseus comes into play here. If Kevin Garnett had come up in modern times, his long twos would have been threes – that’s easy enough to imagine. And he would have gotten a lot more easy dunks in pick-and-roll. Also, he would have come up in a post-Durant era, and had a lot more freedom to handle the ball, and would have done more work facing up instead of in the mid-post…and at some point, *he wouldn’t have been Kevin Garnett.* The Kevin Garnett we got may not have been the most “optimized” version of him, but he played in the style of his time while pushing the envelope in terms of what big men could do as far as he could push it. Should that be enough? I’m not sure, which is why I have more mixed feelings about this take than something like “it’s very easy to imagine Larry Bird making a lot of threes in the modern era.”

**Part 3: Michael Jordan and Occam’s Razor**

After a thesis I find very reasonable and one I have mixed feelings about, let’s move onto one that I see a lot and think is pretty silly – “Michael Jordan would have been a great three-point shooter if he played today, he just played in a time when players didn’t take those so he didn’t care about it.” 

So here’s what we know. Michael Jordan was an amazing basketball player and historically great midrange shooter. I actually think MJ was the greatest player of all time, which I suppose makes me somewhat of a heretic as someone who is also a card-carrying LeBron homer, but I also feel uncomfortable amongst the MJ fanbase because I prefer to talk about the actual Michael Jordan instead of the imaginary one. (Here’s a tangent: MJ’s DPOY season was *ludicrous.* He averaged a league-leading 3.2 steals per game and had 1.6 blocks per game as a shooting guard. LeBron’s career-high for blocks per game is 1.1. *He had more steals than turnovers that season.* Who did he beat for the award? The #2 vote-getter was Mark Eaton, who led the league in blocks. The #3 vote-getter was Hakeem, whom the DPOY trophy is named after now. And he deserved it! He was tied with Hakeem in “stocks,” the Bulls had a better defensive rating than the Rockets, and Jordan was essentially tied with Hakeem in DWS and destroyed him in DBPM. Michael Jordan was incredible.)

However, MJ was not great at shooting 3s. He shot 32.7% from 3 over his career, and he really benefited from the shorter 3-point line – if you take those seasons out, he was a 28.8 shooter from deep. Even taking the league into account, he wasn’t great – his career 3p+ was a below-average 95, and his 3PAr+ was just 71, which is especially low considering guards were taking nearly all of the threes back in those times. He actually participated in a three-point contest once, and posted [the worst score in NBA history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr-NKGIg5BQ).

This is where you’ll run into a viral clip of [MJ saying in an interview that actually, he didn’t want to be great at threes](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vigL3Z9mt1Y), because he would fall too much in love with it and it would take away from the strength of his game, which is attacking the basket. 

Let’s drill down on that one a bit, because it gets cited a lot. First off, MJ loved the shorter line. In his two full seasons with it, he shot 260 and 297 threes, which were both career-high marks – when they moved the line back the next season, he only shot 126. So a shot from 23 feet and 9 inches takes away from attacking the basket, but one from 22 feet doesn’t? 

Also, the post-baseball version of MJ, which is the only version we have tracking data on, actually wasn’t a particularly aggressive basket attacker – in 96-97, 18% of his shots were from within 3 feet, and in 97-98 22.1% of his shots came at the rim. The league, as a whole, took 34.1% of its shots from 0-3 feet in 96-97, and 28.6% of the league’s shots were at the rim in 97-98. Sure, a lot of the looks he got from midrange were set up with the threat of the drive, but that doesn’t seem like enough driving to justify voluntarily giving up a three-point shot, and a lot of his shots came from post-ups in that era. (It should be noted that this is post-baseball MJ, and it looks like that interview clip was from the earlier years.) Also, he wouldn’t at least have tried to extend his range in the Wizards years, when he took less than 14% of his shots at the rim? 

It’s worth mentioning we’re talking about Michael Jordan here. He became a near-professional level golfer because he was mad his college roommate Davis Love III could hit the ball further than him. He would get furious when Christian Laettner beat him at ping-pong on the Dream Team. In 1988, Jordan averaged 35 points per game, won MVP, and also got the aforementioned DPOY award. He threw quarters close to a wall. In 1989, he came to Tim Grover to overhaul his body and training. That’s the guy who said “The three-point shot? The thing I do once per game? The thing I shot 1,778 times in my career? Nah, that’s not worth being good at, I won’t waste my time practicing that.” 

At some point, Occam’s Razor comes into play and I have an easier time believing “the guy who took nearly 2,000 threes and hit a low percentage of them wasn’t very good at them, and may have had enough of an ego to create a self-serving explanation for that weakness in an interview” than “MJ didn’t feel like becoming good threes.” 

This is the part where we mention that MJ focusing on midrange shooting worked very, very well. The Bulls won 69 games in 96-97, 62 games in 97-98, and won the championship both years. It was remarked upon by the media at the time and continues to be mentioned. MJ had a flat stroke that was perfect for mid-range shots, especially with the way he could control it in off-balance situations and over tough coverages, and it allowed him to absolutely dominate a league with a heavy emphasis on mid-range shooting. You can only play in your era, and MJ was perfect for his. That doesn’t roll off the tongue as smoothly as “MJ is the best and he would have no problem being the best in a different way,” but it feels closer to the truth. 

If he had come along today, he probably would have developed a shot with more arc that would have given him more range, but then he wouldn’t have been the Michael Jordan that we got, who was the best NBA player of all time. Also, there are no guarantees on anything – Giannis, Zion Williamson, and other guys were still able to exist in this era, after all. In 20 years, are we going to say “well, if Giannis had been in today’s game, he obviously would have been a great three-point shooter?” Again, the big point is that the actual Michael Jordan should be good enough to appreciate without having to make up a fantasy superhero Michael Jordan that’s good at something the real one never showed any real signs of being great at. 

Alright, it’s well past time to wrap this whole thing up. Modern efficiency has made it very hard to compare players across eras, at least on paper. Almost every great player from the past would likely play the game at least a little bit, if not very, differently, in today’s environment. Sometimes the adjustments we make to past performance, like that the best shooter of his generation would have done well if asked to shoot more, are extremely reasonable. Others are less so, and we don’t want to lose sight of what made players great against the opponents actually faced when trying to fit them into a theoretical modern NBA and compare them with players who are playing a different game.  ",62,36,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1icq4x7/how_should_we_judge_the_shot_diets_of_the_past_oc/,2025-01-29 04:35:25,"This is tremendous content for this sub so thank you for putting this together. I generally agree with you regarding how we should value past achievements in their historical context, but I suspected you would find resistance, and it appears you did. IMO once you start imagining more nuanced and hypothetical situations such as how a player might do in another era, you leave the realm of objective verifiable discourse. Everyone is going to think their take on the matter is the right one, because people don’t like to think their logic isn’t sound, and there isn’t enough data to definitively say one way or another. So while I agree that MJ was pathologically competitive at everything and of course he wanted to be good at 3s, someone else is going to say there’s no reason to think MJ couldn’t have fixed his arc with a modern shot doctor while still remaining lethal from midrange. And they’re going to be just as correct. Still, it’s fun to conjecture, which is good for this sub. 

A few nitpicks- there was an article going around in the last year or two outlining the insane degree of home cooking MJ was receiving on defense in those early years, and a brief look at his home and road splits would support that. In 88 he averaged a mind boggling 4 spg and 2bpg at home against a still solid but nowhere near as impressive 2 and 1 on the road.

Also, I’m not convinced Kobe was a better shooter than LeBron.  He probably was. His style of fadeaway triple teamed daggers to break his opponent’s will probably didn’t help his percentages. But his form was a bit old school, and his last four healthy years he was approaching Westbrook level inefficiency from deep. LeBron has never been a particularly good shooter, but he’s spent the second half of his career being an average one. You can point to their FT%, but occasionally that doesn’t tell the whole story.

I hope you keep posting here. Good stuff || There are definitely fans who value efficiency that did not see Kobe play in his heyday, and are underwhelmed by his stats looking back. But his shot selection (especially relative to the option of feeding Shaq more) was questioned his entire career by media, fans, his own coaches and teammates that didn't have any idea what true shooting percentage was. So I don't think it's suddenly unfair to question it now just because we have different and better tools for looking at it. Some of those tools even reflect favorably upon him, when you examine how he elevated the team offense including in the playoffs and the way he scaled with other good players.

It is interesting to think that from 1979 to 2015, cross era statistical comparisons really only had to adjust for pace. League average offensive rating and true shooting percentage were basically stable that that entire time. I think with some different rules enforcement that could have even maintained through the three point shooting surge. I think it's still the fairest way to do it if you had to, but I don't like that we now have to use layers of abstraction like adjusting true shooting percentage for what the league average was at the time. || I'll admit i didn't make it all the way through your post but I'm not sure why you'd compare Kobes true shooting to modern teams rather than to the same season?  He was 51st in TS% that season so still not terribly efficient.  Great shooter or not i think Kobe gets a knock for his poor shot selection, something that became really pronounced in his later years.  He was notorious for waving off open teammates and shooting his shot good or bad, sort of the anti LeBron in that sense.  So he might have a better stroke than LeBron but did it matter? || The shot profile of today's game has been echoed throughout history, it's just difficult to replicate as players with less talent or mismanaged teams (sorry Cade) try to carry the load without the support needed.

Whenever this topic gets brought up, I always like to bring up two players - Reggie Miller and Manu Ginobili. Reggie Miller was the prototype for Steph Curry, and Manu Ginobili for Harden. (Fun fact; Reggie's lowest TS% was at around 58%!!!, it was in his rookie year and last year in the league; while Manu's peaked at 61 in 2007-08). I would argue, that these two were outliers in their respective generations, which supports your thesis.  
  
I do think today's spacing will inflate some of the modern era's numbers (and that's not a bad thing). Although not really what you're trying to do, but when comparing against eras, I propose to just start with how much better was Player X compared to the average player in his era? vs other similar performers in his era? That should normalise some noise, but its not perfect. || BTW, I believe this is the point I'm allowed to plug my Substack -- you can find this post and others like it at [(5) Krolik's Corner | John Krolik | Substack](https://johnkrolik.substack.com/?r=yw64&utm_campaign=subscribe-page-share-screen&utm_medium=web) if you're so inclined. Take a look around, maybe even subscribe if you're feeling feisty, it's free! || This is a bit of a tangent, but I don't know where else to post it. I find Larry Bird's three point shooting evolution over his career fascinating.

As a rookie, he attempted 1.7 threes per game and made .406. This is outstanding.

But then for his next four seasons, he inexplicably reduced his three point volume to less than one attempt per game, and only made around 25%.

And then in his sixth season he started shooting more threes again (1.6 per game) and made .427. For the rest of his career, he increased his volume even more and mostly stayed over 40%. 

So, what happened in years 2-5? I can think of a couple of possibilities:

1. His rookie season was fool's gold. Maybe he just had great shooting luck in in his rookie year, and his actual expected three point percentage was in the 20s. Then he reverted back to expectations in seasons 2-5. Finally, in season 6 he improved his three point shooting to an elite level (for the time period, at least).

2. He really was an elite three point shooter right from the start. But in seasons 2-5, for some reason his coach told him to stop shooting threes. So he stopped shooting threes in the normal flow of the game. However, since he was the star player, he was responsible for taking most of his team's heaves, ""grenades,"" end-of-shot-clock attempts, and desperation end-of-game shots. With such a low volume of attempts, his three point shot diet was dominated by these low-quality shots. This actually seems more plausible to me than the first hypothesis. Under this scenario, we can speculate about how Bird would have performed with increased three-point volume. Typically we assume that a player's efficiency will be reduced with increased volume, as the player's additional shots are lower-quality than their current average. But in Bird's case, he had such a low volume that the low quality shots discussed above may have actually significantly harmed his efficiency even in his more prolific shooting years (he maxed out at 3.3 attempts per game). So it is plausible that with increased volume, his three point percentage would have actually increased. || Fun fact about Larry Bird: He had more games where he didn’t make any three pointers than games where he made any

I’d agree for sure that he was amazing in his era and that if he was born forty years later he would’ve done things differently and probably made many more, but that’s to me akin to saying “if my aunt had wheels she’d be a bicycle”. He had the same three point line in the 80s, had arguably easier shooting conditions, knew you could take threes at volume (he had 10 attempts multiple times), and still made 649 at 38%. For his time, this is excellent, now it’s not. 

Your Tetris comparison doesn’t hold water here in my opinion, there was no new discovery. Nobody found out that standing in a certain spot your 3P% doubled or something, it’s the same shot that has always existed. Celebrate the players in their era but you can’t really make cross era comparisons, this has been JJ’s point as well || [removed] || Reggie's a guy who modern stats definitely look favorably upon, and there were guys like Kevin Martin who were unappreciated shot-diet pioneers -- the question of ""how much should we penalize guys for accepting conventional wisdom when they had peers who didn't"" is one I don't have a definitive answer for. (TS+ and other stats like it, which I mentioned in the Bird part, do provide a lot of help, but are far from perfect.) || I've been thinking a lot about the Ship of Theseus recently in an entirely different context - the AD trade.

Essentially I'm not sure how Mavs fans could have any attachment to this team when none of their key players have been there more than two years.

Anyway, great post. || Yeah I didn’t have much time to drill down on it, this post was more than long enough as is, but I also found that fascinating. His rookie year was also the 3pt line’s first year in the NBA. || Bird shot more 3PTA (3.1) in his 1988 season than Dirk Nowitzki shot (2.2) during his 2007 MVP season. And he shot it at 41% that season, basically the same rate as Dirk Nowitzki shot in 2007.

Both he and Nowitzki have the same career shooting percentages from 3PT at 38% but for whatever reason I never have to hear that obsessional nitpicking that Dirk didn't shoot enough from three for his era or questions about whether he could play today. || Well that's the gist of parts 2 and 3, so I'm picking up what you're putting down. Maybe I was a bit too timid about not going after players for not taking more agency in their shot selection, but ""the three is a gimmick and it's impossible to make them at high volume"" was heavily entrenched dogma in Bird's time. But your point is well taken, it's not like he (or KG or MJ, for that matter) was gonna get benched if he'd taken five a game. || Not u stealing that bicycle joke, have some shame lmao || The value of the 3 actually is kind of a new discovery, the result of analytics that didn't exist in the era of Bird. We all knew 3 points is more than 2. But people didn't grasp how to leverage that, much like people didn't understand that Tetris trick.

For decades, there was the phrase ""Live by the 3, die by the 3."" It was widely believed that winning basketball and high volume 3 pointers were incompatible because of wide variance in performance. You may get hot and win a game. But you may go cold and lose it. So if you want to win, are you taking the sure thing, or that risky 3? 

Even past the era of Bird, some of the most famous 3 point shooting games have not been the positive type. John Starks going 0-11 from 3 in game 7 is seared into the heads of Knicks fans. That sort of unpredictability is exactly why teams and players shied away from it. || [removed] || Free throws are a big part of it, sure, but to be clear Kobe's eFG% was higher than league average on an extremely tough shot diet for the majority of his prime. Even in his 35 PPG season he was at league average eFG%. || Nah, Kobe was a great finisher relative to era. %’s around the rim have increased dramatically in recent years. || So I came up writing for LA publications and am naturally a Kobe skeptic -- I learned early on that a spoonful (or truckful) of sugar is pretty necessary for the medicine to go down when it comes to talking about Kobe (or MJ, for that matter.) || I’m sure Bird could play today, the greats all could. My quibble is more with considering him an alltime great shooter. I wouldn’t say Dirk is either || The analytics of 3X0.376 > 2X0.509 (in the case of Bird) was there the whole time, it’s pretty simple math. It’s different than the Tetris trick described because people literally didn’t know that existed. Not doing simple math is not the same thing

I think the phrase you mentioned still persists today, as 3pt shooting does have a lot of variance. Think about the Rockets finishing their game shooting 0/27 against the Warriors in game 7. I don’t think winning basketball was ever at odds with shooting 3s, it was just known to be a riskier play || Please do not attack the person, their post history, or their age as a proxy for disagreeing with their opinions. || Mid 30s, I never watched Bird play. I’m well aware that the game was played differently in the 80s, but the rules weren’t significantly different in any way. Should I give Bird credit for falling in line with the status quo? || Back then, we could count to three and even do percentages. 

Although the league can be slow in adapting changes, I don’t think this was it. A 3p specialist, like Tracy Murray, could get up to 40% some seasons. It wasn’t viable because it was unreliable and teams would defend it more in the playoffs. 
«Jump shooting teams» had never won any rings for a reason, not some arbitrary conventional wisdom. || IDK about ""great,"" career 63.7% finisher when the average during the time he played was 61.4%. Certainly respectable though, especially for a guard/wing. || He still has some of the highest scoring rounds in the 3PT contest I believe, if that means anything. || But the Tetris trick was always there, the same as the numbers for 3's. It's the same situation where people didn't see a solution that was there the whole time. I mean, people didn't realize you could hit a button twice to increase efficiency for 30 years? That seems just as glaring as the 3's. Especially with the headwinds against the 3 based off from conventional wisdom. That's why I would say that comparison holds up.

That Rockets game is different in terms of context and the common discourse around the 3. That game was after Curry and the Warriors showed you could win a title by the 3. As well as the previous year of beautiful basketball by the Spurs. And your last point about it being a riskier play is exactly why the best teams would be hesitant to rely on it. If you can win consistently, why introduce variables that could hurt as much as help? Especially when there were more glaring instances of it hurting you?

And I forgot to address your point about Bird's 3P% being less than optimal today: even if we ignore Bird practicing the 3 more, there is another factor at play when accounting for those numbers. With the 3 revolution, teams specifically design plays to get open 3's. If Bird's coaches weren't actively scheming to get him open 3's, his numbers will look different than a modern player who benefits from that. || He was consistently well above league average for his position, for the vast majority of his career. +2.3 rEfficiency for a guy who was also above average from 3-23 feet is excellent. || I think Bird is an all-timer in terms of shooting. But I really don't think the small sample size controlled conditions of a 3 point contest are the points of proof we should look to. I think the eye test, looking at Bird's shooting form, things along those lines are the angles we should pursue for Bird. || He’s tied for 9th, tied for 31st, and tied for 35th in terms of percentage among out of 38 winners alltime. Now, that’s compared to winners which is a tough bar but I don’t think it matters much anyway",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.046,0.798,0.156,0.9999,0.067,0.786,0.147,0.9998

For a very long time, people have pointed out that this ""punished"" the team that drafted well and made the supermax less attractive.

The truth is that, on top of being a way for teams to keep their homegrown stars, **the supermax is also a big profit sharing scheme between good and bad teams**, because of the luxury tax implications. 

Most teams who pay a supermax end up in the luxury tax, and thus, if they pay 7M more to a player because of the super max, they will usually pay 14M or even 20M+ in luxury tax to other teams. Successful teams like the Warriors, who get tons of extra revenue, thus have to pay some of it back to the other, less successful teams. That's right: for every dollar Curry earns because of the supermax, NBA owners get $1.5 to $5 more. The supermax is more about paying owners than players. Because star players are so profitable, successful owners were willing to accept it.

This was the situation up to the new CBA. But now that the second apron comes with severe operational restrictions, successful teams are no longer able to simply ignore the cap. The supermax is suddenly much more of a burden.

This creates a weird incentive for teams to exchange star players. Theoretically, If two teams draft two twins, with exactly the same talent and skill set, they have a big incentive to exchange them so that they can pay them 5% less and use the extra money to get an additional good role player.

I see two solutions to this issue: either exempt the extra 5% from the cap hit while lowering the salary cap slightly so that on net the total salary outlay of teams remains the same. Or let players retain their supermax right after being traded, but not if they move in free agency.",277,86,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iheeu1/with_the_new_cba_the_supermax_is_no_longer_viable/,2025-02-04 05:05:18,"The supermax is a problem for one time all NBA guys like KAT or Fox, those fuck over your team building.

This is a singular issue with one player so far

Nico just didn’t see him the same way the rest of the NBA seems to || Would add: I'd like to see them give some sort of ""you've played with this team >10 years"" salary cap discount. 

Lakers shouldn't have had to decide between paying old Kobe and having a competitive team; paying old Kobe to play for the Lakers was good for the league and what would have been better is if they could have also been the 6-8 seed instead of a lottery team.

Similarly, would love to see the Bucks not have to choose between giving Giannis a max next contract and staying out of the lottery. Or even, yes, Curry + Klay counting less against the cap at this point in their careers so they could both stay with the Warriors. Because it would be way more fun to cheer against the Warriors if they could have kept the band together. || I still don't understand why the PA agreed to the new CBA. It's the owners dream. A reason to cut costs. || Agreed. While I believe this is certainly somewhat about the SuperMax, I think it is moreso about the fact that inside the Mavs organization there was a growing fear that Luka wanted out of Dallas.  There were lots of rumblings that Luka wanted to be in LA or Miami.   The Heat and the Brooklyn Nets are both running their operations as though they are making room for Luka in free agency. As an owner and a GM, you ignore those rumblings at your own peril.  There are reports of multiple Mavs insiders saying that they felt ""held hostage"" by Luka and his behavior in light of his looming SuperMax extension eligibility this offseason.

Why? It is because while players can't say ""I'll only play for X team\[s\]"", they can say ""I'm only interested in signing an extension with X team\[s\].""  Look at what just happened with Fox.  Mavs ownership, because of their goals with the new arena complex or possibly moving the team, could not have Luka hold them hostage for the entirety of next season while he sat out with various injuries because he wanted to be moved to his destination of choice.

Many are implicitly comparing the return the Mavs got on this trade with the KD trade.  Here's the problem: We have a new CBA and that trade was an absolute robbery.  That trade took place under the old CBA.  This trade took place under the new CBA.  Some want to compare it to the Bridges trade.  Well, Bridges is on the most team friendly contract in the entire league and he wasn't willing to temporarily set fire to his career by demanding a trade and publicly agitating.

All of that said, and AD is a fantastic player in this league, I would have expected Luka for AD to net a difference of 3-4 FRPs.  We can look at Christie(good) and his contract (great) and Maxi(bad) and his contract (bad) and say that's worth 1 FRP.  That leaves 2-3 FRPs and the Mavs got just 1 FRP.  So, it feels like they got 1-2 fewer FRPs than they should have in the deal. That stings, even if Luka was actually deadset on leaving in FA and the Mavs had to pull the trigger before this trade deadline for business reasons. || This same issue was there during the prior CBA. Trading for a “twin” theoretically has an incentive. The issue is, the new twin has zero incentive of staying with you, and can just leave in FA. || Of course it is still viable....for the right player.  If a player is delivering $70m of value on the court (however you want to define that) and you're paying them whatever the supermax is, let's say $65m/year, then the team should still be plenty happy with the contract.  Paying that much money for one player does not necessarily mean that it is an overpay for that player and it does not require that the team be over the salary cap after that point.

I do agree that the second apron might mean the teams will not be handing supermax contracts as easily, particularly for players that are more ""on the fringe"" of that caliber of player (obviously they are still great players in a vacuum).  But, generally speaking, the very best of the best will still be well worth the supermax contract. || Good! Spread the wealth! Give those mid level guys actual mid level contracts instead of paying two guys so much and everyone else so much less.  || I think people are reading waaaay too much into the unique circumstances of one person being an idiot + FOS and an ownership group not involved enough to check him.
Luka is one of those few guys worth more than the 35% supermax. You can absolutely build an elite team around him without going over the second apron.
The issue is those borderline All NBA GUYS who make that singular 3rd team at like 28, not someone with 5 consecutive All NBA first teams. || The NBA is in for a rude awakening when the current CBA ends. We’re headed for another lockout. I’ve been saying it for a couple years now. At the very least they need to do the amnesty clause again so organizations can shed some of these team killing contracts. 

1/3rd of the teams in the league are stuck in checkmate with no realistic way to improve, and it’s almost always because of one immovable contract. This makes for a horrible product, and kills competition. It created this whole “if we’re not contenders we might as well be tanking” mindset that we’re seeing. 

Good teams like Denver and Milwaukee are punished for being great with these ridiculous new financial rules. 

Boston seems to be the first team to really figure this out and take advantage of it: use your draft picks to fill out your bench, and then just let the guy go or trade him for more picks to repeat the process. Props to them for figuring this out, but as we can see, it essentially creates “monopolies” where the only truly competitive teams are the teams playing this game. OKC is setup perfectly to implement this same strategy, and I suspect they will. They’ve created a system that practically any competent NBA player can be plugged in to. If your name isn’t Shai, Chet, or Jalen, you are just a cog. 

I see how the league thought they were stopping superteams, but they kinda just prevented us from ever getting to see another great dynasty form now that you’re basically only allowed to be great for like 3-4 years before the financial rules force you to make a tough decision. || The problem with not counting something like the extra bump from the SuperMax against the cap for apron purposes is that the ultimate goal here from a fan perspective is more parity in the league.  We don't want the silly KD Warriors super duper team.  So, it all has to count. || If other teams and owners follow suit with trading out their stars before they're eligible for the Supermax, they could logically argue that the Supermax isn't needed (if no players actually become eligible, either naturally or by design), and lobby to have that contract framework removed from the next CBA. || I'd argue that fewer max contracts need to be handed out in general, and more 'middle income' contracts need to be happening.

It is supposed to balance it out so that the teams that have the all nba guys basically lose a role player. 

AND it doesn’t make a difference. That’s because the best players are more than a role player difference. A list of some of the champions, Tatum, Brown, Kawhi, LeBron, AD, Curry, Giannis, Jokic. Guys that made the finals, Luka, Booker, Butler. Those are a list of almost all the best players of the last 6 years. So this crippling supermax theory doesn’t feel like it holds up. 

People who want to give bonuses that benefit the team for having one of the absolute best players are being ridiculous. Those players also generate more revenue for their teams. I would bet that those teams actually make more money than the difference between a regular max and a supermax. || It’s a nit pick, but Curry is not technically on a Supermax deal.  Rather, he is eligible for a 35% cap contract by virtue of having 10+ years of NBA service.  The Supermax bumps guys that would otherwise be on a 30% max (7-9 service years) to 35%.  10+ years get 35% either way.

I’ve long thought that a good approach would be to have teams be allowed to pay their home-drafted stars extra money, but have it count the same 30% on the cap || It’s 17% larger || pretty sure fox was not going to be supermax eligible unless he made all nba again anyway.

Back when the supermax was introduced, the idea was that loyalty matters and the best players should get extra incentives for staying. On the team side, the idea was that it was supposed to benefit drafting well, instead of creating the evil manufactured superteams like Boston and Miami. There was a clear message that your team should be as good as you draft and that was the ""right way"" to build a franchise. Well, the Warriors happened. Cap smoothing was introduced to stop people from taking advantage of a big jump year like they did with KD. Then they made consolidation trades to get Wiggins. The Warriors just kept on finding ways to pay more money to stay relevant. Suddenly, the drafted core was no longer the honorable way to win. 


So you have the supertax. 


Now, that apron is so punitive that anybody who drafts literally more than 1 star at a time is cooked. It squeezed out a lot of the veteran middle class because it is better to take a flyer on a bunch of rookies than getting a proven 10M a year guy. Now, for contenders, that same guy costs 45-60M. Even worse, it kills small market teams even harder, because if they get into the second apron, not only do they have to pay, but they also don't get the profit sharing from other teams' huge tax bills. At this point, I don't know what the ""ideal roster construction"" is now besides ""don't be too good"". || It's not just one player. The Supermax is an issue for fringe All-NBA guys who make 3rd team. Guys like Fox, Gobert, Beal. Mid market teams who have these players as their main star get hurt because they are being paid like Steph Curry but cannot produce at that level. || Unless the Mavs know something about Luka's health it behaviour/actions that the rest of the league does not, the only plausible explanation is this has been done to kill off the supermax at the next CBA and potentially take the league to a harder cap.

Now that private equity is coming into the league, these guys value everything on spreadsheets. So unless a title gets you 2x revenue, there's no value in going into the luxury tax. || “Singular issue”

Okay KAT, Fox, and Luka happened. Why am I hearing “singular”? You can even argue Hali.

Wolves were forced to trade KAT because the supermax will super fuck them in the 2nd apron next season. 

Fox’s value as a player dramatically lowered for the Kings because he’s playing hard for a supermax he’s not worth, trying to get a 3rd team nod. 

Luka was traded in large part of saving cap space.

In major points:

\- 30/13/10 on 66% TS is insane. Russ did this in 2016 on 55% TS and everyone went crazy - that's the difference between a league average efficiency scorer and perhaps the most efficient volume scorer in NBA history. His efficiency gets even crazier when you look at the fact that he puts a ton of his own misses back with his offensive rebounds, leading the league in self putbacks by far. He is near 70% when you account for the fact that in such scenarios, the first shot doesn't cost a possession and efficiency is best measured per possession. He is also shooting 47% from three, and if you take out the heaves it's still over 50%. FIFTY PERCENT FROM THREE. He is averaging more points per jumpshot this year than Steph Curry did in any of his best seasons. That's insane

\- We can look at offensive on/off to measure how a team's offense performs with vs without a player. While not a perfect stat, it gives a good gauge of offensive impact. Jokic already has the two highest offensive on/off seasons since play by play data was first recorded in 1997, both around +19 points/100 possessions. For comparison to some of the best offensive players' best seasons since then, peak Steph had one +18 season, LeBron had a +15, Harden a +14, Kobe a +12, Embiid a +10, and Luka a +8 (keep in mind he plays \[played?\] with another high level offensive guard so this probably undersells his value). This season, Jokic has a +24 offensive on/off, by far the best of all time. Before you all come with the lineup manipulation critiques, the Nuggets have played **more minutes than ever** with Jokic + bench lineups. Jamal Murray has missed a ton of games and sucked in many others, Gordon has been out a lot, and MPJ has staggered with the bench a lot along with Gordon and Jamal. Yet that unit has still been an absolute failure on offense, while Jokic + all bench generates an offensive rating equivalent to the best offense ever. It's incredible.

There's so much else we can look at, but another interesting thing is the revival of Westbrook. Westbrook scores more points per 100 possessions on TEN PERCENT BETTER TS% when Jokic is out there (60%) than when he is not (50%). Again, that is an insane difference. He's revived, but somehow only revived when Jokic is on the court.

I'm not even a Nuggets fan, I'm a Celtics fan born and raised. But I do think you could make a great case for this being the GOAT offensive season, and I'm leaning more and more towards actually making that case.",221,114,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ihcvwc/nikola_jokic_is_having_the_best_offensive_season/,2025-02-04 03:08:06,"I think 2022/23 already had a case for the best offensive season ever, and then he decided to shoot 50% from 3(granted he was also better on floaters and on midrange jumpers in 23) , so it's getting hard to make a strong case against it.

  
If he isn't the best offensive player ever, he is almost indisputably the most complete offensive player of all time, and I don't think it's that close. Stephs shooting, Lebron's rim pressure, Magic's playmaking, or Jordan's scoring is more valuable than any one thing he does. But try and come up with another player who is a ultra elite scorer in all 3 levels,  on and off the ball, while also being pretty comfortably the best passer in the NBA, and you are going to struggle to come up with someone even close to that. || The only thing I would say is league average effeciency has increased a lot in recent years. It hovered from 52% to 54% from like the 80s to 2016. And has now jumped up to 57%. I would also say that individual statlines have gotten more ridiculous. Lebron in the 2000s and mid 2010s averaging 27-7-7 was as well rounded as it got, and now there are a lot of guys putting up those kinds of statlines. Now there are 10+ guys averaging a similar statline and even LeBron before this year had basically no drop off in his statline despite clearly not being at his peak levels. 

I say all this to just provide some context. It can definitely still be argued he’s the best offensive player we have seen. || [removed] || [deleted] || Jokic is 100% having an all time great offensive season, but I have an issue with a couple of things

1. I don't think that, If we're talking about the best offensive season ever, we can take 3P% at face value, right? Jokic is averaging 47% from three sure but in 4 3PA/G. 2016 Steph averaged 45% on ELEVEN attempts per game.
2. Scoring is scoring, nothing to argue with that but when you add ""Volume"" scorer, IMO It gets associated with a bunch of shooters, and so we assume Joker is shooting the rock from outside like prime Klay when in reality two thirds of Jokic attempts are within 10ft of the basket.
3. On-Off can tell you how a team looks with or without a player, but It doesn't define how good the player is. Lebron, Harden, Kobe, Embiid, Luka, Russ, had at times monster on-off numbers because the rest of the team sucked without them.

If we keep the ""best offensive season ever"", simple (scoring, assisting, efficiency) I believe he does have a case for that.

The Westbrook connection you allude to is a perfect example of this. Russ definitely gets easier looks when a scorer like Jokic is on the floor, particularly when Jokic is actually passing to to him as a cutter. However, the stats are muddied up by the fact that for most of the last couple of months Russ has been on the floor almost exclusively only when Jokic is too - this was intentional by Malone. Also, these stats highlight how well Russ has played, after being inserted into the starting lineup, where he also has thrived next to Gordon (when he's playing), MPJ, and Braun. 

Most of the stats where Russ was shooting more poorly likely came from early season when he was playing with a terrible, inexperienced, and poorly formed bench unit lacking in outside shooters and defenders. Since then, all the bench units have been completely staggered.

You need versatile players that can switch and shoot. Thats why “3&D” are some of the most valuable role players every team that wins have.",0,90,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ih1z33/do_you_think_you_can_win_a_championship_if_your/,2025-02-03 17:25:29,"(1) 

You couldn’t win if your best player wasn’t a dominant big… until Bird and Magic. 

Fine, dominant big or a 6’ 8” + freak. Not a scoring guard….until Jordan. 

Couldn’t win without a top 5 player…until Detroit. 

Couldn’t win with a liability on defense as a big man…until Dirk. 

Well maybe it’s just you can’t win with a liability on defense at CENTER…until Jokic. 

And jump shooting teams can’t win…until GSW.

There’s a limited number of championships that are largely monopolized by a couple guys each decade - so I don’t think “X style has never won before” means much. Even less so when there is already an exception, like you Steph point.

Luka was in the finals last year. Anything can happen in one series (Vegas gave them about a 30% chance).

In 2015 the warriors got to play a Cavs team missing 3/5 starters. In 2019 the Raptors got to play a team missing two future hall of famers in their prime. In 2020 and 2023 both champions got to play Heat teams that weren’t “a real contender” and by your logic in 2024 the Celtics got a free pass against a bad defensive guard.  || Certainly they can. Using “aside from golden state” doesn’t really make sense. We know it’s possible as we’ve seen GSW do it. What the question really should be is it worth the effort? GS did it with generational level team building. So yes, perhaps it’s harder or takes more specific team building, but it’s certainly possible. 

I don’t think by any means Luka is a hindrance to his team because of poor defence like these questions seem to be implying. If you take any championship winning team and put Luka on it instead of their best player there’s a good chance they still win it. The Mavs were this close just last season - and whilst they got blown out, they were close enough to winning that I think you could say that roster could win a championship with minor adjustments and a bit of luck. || Jokic won and while he’s average or even above average at defence, he was playing the most important defensive position. So no, your post doesn’t really make sense for the “modern NBA”. I’d rather have a guard who’s a liability or mid at defence than a center || The 2 way guard that won the title for the Nuggets was...? KCP? One wing player isn't carrying an entire defense.  It's a combined effort and execution on part of your team. 

It's obviously preferable that your best players are 2way players, but a banged up Luka Doncic with the actually rather mediocre performance of Kyrie Irving obliterated the West. Their defense was carried by the addition of Gafford and DJJ as none of the teams they faced in the West had enough shooting to spread out their large lineups. Being able to rely on your rim protection matters a lot. They destroyed a Minnesota team that featured both a 2way wing defender AND an elite rim protector. 

Yet The Boston Celtics were able to dissect the Mavericks defense because they shot *a lot* of 3s. It wasn't even in PnR they just attacked Luka in isolation. Yet this season the Celtics have gotten significantly worse as shooters, and with the way they're playing right now they'd lose to the Mavs in the Finals. 

So honestly, it's matchup dependent. 

If you put Luka in previous eras his ""poor"" defense matters a lot less because there's much less shooting and spacing. || Yes. Luka could have led the Mavs to a title if the team was slightly better or if his competition was worse. Replace Tatum with Luka and the Celtics become unstopable instead of just great. || Golden State did it four times with Steph but youre also saying nuh uh you can't use them as an example... || There's being a liability on D and dogging it on defense. Luka dogs it on defense while players like Steph sticks to the team's principles and provides great effort. The same can be said for Jokic. I think the big issue with guys like Luka is that it can be hard to hold everyone accountable when your best player is on BS. It can be corrosive. || The 2016 Warriors that went 73-9 didn't have KD, they only had KD for 3 years from 2017-2019 but KD got injured in 2019 and left.

And the reason the warriors were so good with steph as a liability is because they had Draymond, Iggy, Klay, Zaza were all good defenders & in 2017 once they got KD they became overpowered offensively. || I believe that yes you can and that it's irrelevant to look back on the history of the NBA as the game changes exponentially in short term periods. There is always additional context as to why this blueprint hasn't won, Harden for example was very close to the Finals, it's just that he had GSW to go against, who were one of the greatest teams of all time. Dallas last year had to face a Boston team on a legendary run, still were runner ups so they had a good chance. || Pretty much. Defense is half the game. It’s really tough to win the chip if your defense isn’t top-10. Having a very weak perimeter defender puts your defense in rotation. It’s far less of an issue against weaker offensive teams but deep in the playoffs it’s too much of a liability.  || Curry’s defense is underrated, also. He’s strong for his size and is good at reading passing lanes. He got targeted because he’s the smallest part of the lineup and every other starter was a plus defender, but he’s not a “liability” like Trae Young or Isaiah Thomas. || Magic and IT both won titles. Harden was a CP3 injury away from winning a title. Curry has won 4 titles as the best player. 

Pretty much any individual weakness a player can have can be solved with the right teammates. || The only true way to predict champions is regular season wins as cliche as it sounds.

67 wins- 77 percent chance of winning title(10-3 all time)

Top 3 seed(Every champion ever but 2)

40-20 rule(Every champion since merger except 2)

Teams constructs change based on the star and fit matters almost as much as talent. 

It's harder to win a chip when your best player is under 6'6 but not impossible fit matters. Curry won as best in 22 and CP3 would've won as best player in 21 if Giannis ain't go nuclear. Just gotta construct the roster to fit right.

Edit:

To add further context the only teams that won 67 games but failed to win title were the 16 Warriors who were a game away, the 16 Spurs who lost to the Thunder and the 07 Mavs who on paper suffered the worst first round loss of all time. That means outside 2016 every team that won 67 games won the chip.

The Rockets in 95 won title without hitting the 40-20 rule as did the 04 Pistons but they had huge mid season trades and were much better teams after the trades. 

Top 3 seed again the 95 Rockets last team to win as under a 3 seed but they added Drexler mid season so when you add context they probably would've been top 3 had Drexler played for them full season. || Forget liability on defense because that’s subjective- just look at size.

Players who won as the #1 below 6’6: West, Thomas, Wade, Curry.

That’s it. It’s really really hard and you have to be an all time great. Bigger players are just intrinsically more consistent because they can get to the rim better and have a leg up on defense and rebounding. 

Like for all his defensive faults, Luka still averages like 9 rebounds and isn’t an easy post up- that’s an advantage over someone like Brunson or Trae (or another elite small guard). Modern offense benefits these guys, but it still hasn’t been done by anyone other than Curry. || My hypothesis has always been that you can win a title with one of your stars being a poor defender, but not if both of your two biggest stars are poor defenders. So Dallas last year with  Luka + Kyrie, that combo was not going to win a title. Similar with Dallas a couple of decades ago. Dirk + Nash never made it, but Dirk + some shooters and defenders made it twice and won it once.

I'm suspicious of Luka + LeBron for the same reasons. LeBron obviously used to be a good if not great defender, but currently his defense has fallen off a cliff even while his offense is still excellent. Maybe he's just saving it for the playoffs, but the reality is with even a nigh-timeless player like him I'm not sure his body can do everything he needs it to do on both ends of the court any more.  Both guys are still excellent players, and I think both could even win a title next a guy *worse* than the other if that guy was a good defender, but the combo of 2 stars who are below average on defense has arguably never once worked in history to win a title.  *Maybe* you could say one or two of those 80s Lakers teams, but I think by the time Kareem became a lousy defender, James Worthy had overtaken him as their #2 star in terms of actual importance to the team even if Kareem was still the bigger name - though reasonable people can disagree. || Dirk wasn't actually a liability on defense in his prime fyi. || Just because these things have happened doesn’t mean they aren’t anomalies. || Why doesn’t it make sense? GS is an anomaly in my opinion because they had the greatest shooter of all time with the greatest team of all time. So unless you are going to replicate that, it’s not a winning formula. So you need a BIG or a 2 way wing/guard || My post literally says your leader has to be a BIG. Is joker not a big? || Who says center is the most important defensive position? That’s arguable. I’d rather have my best player not be a liability or mid on defense. I want my max player to be a 2 way freak like LeBron or kawhi OR a big like dirk or jokic to build around. Having a guard with no d is damn near impossible to build around and win championships || Jokic is not above average at defence lol. He’s average on a good day and is mostly below average - horrible in the regular season. The reason it worked in 2023 was because we had elite screen navigation in KCP and Bruce Brown. They masked a lot of Jokic’s weakness on that end, not allowing quicker guards a free path to the basket. Obviously Jokic puts more effort in on that end in the post season, and is usually neutral-ish in value, but from what I saw of Luka in the finals the same cannot be said. 

Now that the Nuggets have zero screen navigation on the roster you’re seeing consistently how much of a cone Jokic is at the rim.  || The crucial difference is you can't play Jokic off the floor. His size lets him actually physically be able to guard most players, even if he's not effective at it. Contrast that to Curry, who is basically physically unable to guard wings and above because he is quite literally too tiny of a human being. Curry made it work because he's the greatest shooter ever, but there's only one of those. || The Nuggets also did that ONE time so far, with a very stack defensive unit around Jokic in SPECIFIC areas. They had KCP & Bruce brown as POA defenders. KCP also gave great floor spacing so he was two key components simultaneously. MPJ is a big body who defensive rebounds well & gives u generational floor spacing. You also had AG who is like a souped up Shawn Marion on the back end. He did a great job on LeBron both series. 

The Nuggets had the perfect roster construction & Jokic maintained his offensive ceiling’s throughout that run so it worked out. They’ve been something less each year since. What the nuggets did building a defense that was championship level around Jokic should not be seen as the blue print. Or even something that is likely or common. You need that offensive star to maintain his production round after round while relying on your other starters & role players to give extra effort every night on defense to make up for short comings. While also being able to contribute offensively like KCP, AG, Brown, MPJ etc. || I said a 2 way guard/wing OR a big. I think you can dominate the game more simply by being a bigger player (Jokic/Dirk) . Size is very crucial in basketball. I think if Luka was more of a 2 way player he would be even more dangerous. || Joker is a big and led his team to the chip that was included in my OP || Continues to be wild to me how people just assert their opinions on hypotheticals as if they were fact

The Celtics won last year because of their defense above all, and their defensive scheme was built upon a foundation of everyone being able to hold their own in most situations, making help defense and thus scrambling rarely necessary.

I see a world where Luka leads the Celtics to a chip but it can’t just be assumed because that would be a team with a very different identity on both ends. || Switch Luka with literally any player on the Celtics last year and he wins the title, it’s wild how people anchor to him being “exposed” when he just played a way better team || During a decent number of finals the opportunity also had an injured star. If the Celtics didn’t have Brown during that series they might have lost and history would be different. Then there’s game variance and so on. The Mavs were underdogs in that Final, but it’s not like they couldn’t have won. || Btw Steph played D. Led the league in steals || Because Steph is the goat shooter and that’s not Luka. 
Warriors are the goat team and that’s not the Mavs. So it’s apples and oranges to compare the 2",0.069,0.458,0.473,0.891,0.058,0.845,0.097,0.7425,0.097,0.705,0.198,0.9998

Players that can reach 3000 3 pointers and how many i think they will get (out of the current top 250 players for total 3 pointers),"I see people making strong statements saying that you are kidding yourself if you don't think that curry's record will be surpassed ""by manu guys"". Of course if the nba exists for 200 more years everything will be surpassed by manu guys but This is my prediction as far as players who are in the top 250 of bball ref, which is 800+

Curry (5000) and Harden (3500) already have  
Lillard (3600)  
Thompson (3300)  
Mitchell (3200)  
Tatum (3500)  
Doncic (3600)  
Edwards (3500)

close but no: pg buddy hield kd lebron, mccollum.

I may be exaggerating curry's number but he still scores 4,2 3pointers per game. It's true that steph curry's record is not optimized which is crazy considering how much above everybody else he is. Curry has lost quite a few hundreds 3 pointers by being born before the curry revolution. Then he also played 3 years in college, also his durability has been very average, 2 big injuries + many missed games every year.\*\* But at the same time

a) it's incrediby tough to beat it. for example if you play an elite 1300 games (24 players in history, chris paul is at 1320) and you manage to have a 3,3 3 pointers per game, you are at 3900, which is his current number (3925). The thing is, currently, after curry (3,9) the 2nd highest is 3,1 (klay) and 3,0 (lillard) btw two players from his generation. some young players that now average around 3,0 can grow of course because they scored less of them in the first few seasons, but it's tough to imagine that it can grow to 3,3 or more, or maybe it can for a bit before going down this mark at the end of their career. Of course they could play more than 1300 games, there have been some guys at 1400, 1500 and even 1 at 1600, but that's incredibly rare and ofc average goes down as total games go up.

b) there havent been elite all time great shooters in the last years, or at least great great shooters that are great players or great shooters that seem to have great longevity. all the guys scoring a lot of 3s are not great shooters. edwards, doncic, tatum, mitchell, all go from decent to good (mitchell), for all of them elite shooting is not the main part of their game, edwards and mitchell are more athletic than shooters, tatum is shot creation at his height and versatility, doncic is overall offensive creation and playmakig. beside this edwards outlier season.

Steph curry's record can be broken, but there needs to be somebody in the league who's an all time great shooter and a great player and that will have great longevity, and for now we don't have anything like that.

\*\*it's tough to have it all, for example stoctkton has those unbeatable records despite not playing a lot his first 3 years, also playing 4 years of college, and also playing at least half of his career in a low pace era. james scoring record on the other hand is pretty optimized. he started playing at 18 when you could go straight out of hs, ofc he has one of the highest career ppg, the first 10 years of his career he played in a low scoring era but now he played more than half in a high scoring one. not totally tho cause he shoots less than other players + he didnt start in a high scoring era. wilt's rebounds record is very optimized cause in those times they averaged damn near double the reboudns and the guy played all the minutes",159,78,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ikd9gj/will_somebody_surpass_steph_currys_record_players/,2025-02-07 21:55:14,"Yes, it’ll happen eventually. 

Curry wasn’t chucking threes quite at the rate he is now when he first entered the league. Not to mention his first few years were plagued with injury. 

You already have players coming in shooting multiple threes a game while remaining healthy. ANT just earned the nod for the youngest player to reach 1000+ threes. ANT is already on pace to do it so long as he stays healthy, and there will undoubtedly be more players who come in who
shoot a lot of threes while remaining healthy

Will Curry be passed as the “greatest” shooter ever? I don’t think so any time soon, but his record will be broken. || Nobody in the league right now is surpassing him.

This recent wave of young NBA talent still was not fully immersed in the 3pt revolution. They may have molded their games around it in HS and college but it’s not the game they grew up playing.

Kids these days are trying to play Steph Curry’s game. It will still take a generational talent to overtake him but they will arrive in the next 20 years imo. || It’ll happen for sure. Curry could stay the greatest ever but he missed a lot of time entering the league late, being the one to revolutionize the 3 means he wasn’t taking as many as he should early in his career, and injuries. || If Silver pushes through with that 10 min quarter, then no, no one is surpassing him... || every record (except maybe wilts 100 and stocktons career assist record due to inflated stats) can be broken. remember, kareem’s record was thought to be unbroken until a few years ago || Steph is sitting at 3925 3PM right now. Let's say he retires with about 4800. That means someone has to average 300 3PM for 16 years. I think that's technically doable, but under the assumption that 3pt FG volume goes way up. Last year, Steph made 357 3PMs. Nobody else in the league made 300.

What would make Steph's record vulnerable? Steph was 21 when he entered the league, so someone who enters as a teenager has a few years head start. Also, Steph didn't even attempt 500 3PAs in a season until his 4th season, and didn't attempt 10 3PAs a game until his seventh season. Add in a few injury-riddled seasons and he left a lot of 3PMs on the table.

That said, if someone else ever makes 402 3PM in a season, I'd be astonished if he made them at a .454 clip. And I'd also be shocked if someone shoots .454 3pt٪ and makes even 350 3PMs. Maybe it can happen if the NBA pushes even softer defenses and teams averaged 130 ppg. || I doubt anyone can make 5000 3 pointers in their career. 
Hypothetically, let's assume a legend comes up at 18 years to the league and plays till he's 38.(Not everyone can be LeBron).
In those 20 years, he'll have to make 250 3s every single year. Considering how most players are only playing in 60-70 games each regular season, it's about (3.4-4.1) 3pm each season. There are 25 players who make more than 3 per game and 12 who make at 3.4 per game.
If you expect 4 per game then it's only 3 players.
Also, the highest ppg by a rookie this year is 15 and 3s is 3 per game.**
Keeping all that in mind, you'd need a  generational player being top 20 in 3s per game and can hit it consistently for more than 20 years and you'll still be lacking a little.
Now let's consider Steph Curry's ceiling.
He's made 3925 3 pointers till now.
He might add another 100-150 by the post season and then 500-600 on top of it.
He'll have a ceiling of 4600-4750.
That's tough to beat. 
The guy has to be generationally good, make 3.5-4 3s a night for over two decades and.... he'll still be under 300-500.
(4×65 =260. 260×20= 4200)
Steph is amazing. You have to realise that everyone shooting 3s might change how the game is, but even so, everyone is sharing the shots, so it's not one guy is making over 5 3s for a whole decade.
I think many will come close, like Ant. But...he's not Steph || Steph inspired a generation of players to bomb away from 3. His record will be broken || ANT has scored 1001 in 4 1/2 seasons. This has moved him from 2974 away from the record to 2924 away from the record.

A lot can change in the nba in the time it would take to catch the record. There could be 4 point shots and no corner 3's before he gets anywhere close. || Hard to say. On the one hand the league has changed so much that the conditions are currently more inviting for someone to come along and break the record. On the other hand, Curry is an extremely unique talent. We also don’t know how long this iteration of nba offense will last. If the nba eventually moves back the 3 point line, or at least gets rid of the corner 3, it’d be hard to see anyone touching the record || Curry had a special combination of elite shooting genetics and dedicated training from a young age, along with his competitive drive (which separated him from Seth). His own children may be the only people capable of eventually breaking his record someday. || It's gonna happen in our lifetime bud. Look at Ant being the fastest to reach 1,000 3's, there are only going to be more players coming in the respect these guys and want to be better. || Curry had 900 at LUKA's age.

Luka have 1300 already.

The rest will be history. || I think young players who will be chucking 3’s their whole career in bulk, from the start of their careers will overtake Curry.  But that doesn’t stop Curry from being the greatest shooter ever. || There are already quite several players on pace to surpass Steph’s record, we have rookies dropping 9 3’s in games already. Some players are averaging 3-5 3pms for the season. 

His record will be broken sooner rather than later but he knows this and doesn’t bother him in the slightest. || [removed] || While I agree with the sentiment someone will catch him there is context to saying Ant is on pace just for the fact Ant is chasing a hockey stick that’s about to kick up to the right.

From 24yo-30yo Steph made 2,113 threes. 

The race to 2k and 3k are going to be interesting to watch || 2011-2012 was the only year he really was seriously affected by injury. He played 80 games on 2009-2010, 74 games in 2010-2011, and played 78+ games from 2012-2017. || We need to realise that Steph was not a volume 3pt shooter in the first few years of his career (compare now) and he also missed alot of games due to injuries. He is not the fastest to reach 1K 3ptrs. 

Anthony Edwards already have 1K in only 300+ games. 

With the 3pt revolution, the guy who will break his record has already arrived or will be in the next 5 years. || Steph Curry’s first all star season was 11.5 years ago. Anthony edwards was 12. And he’s been in the league for 5 years. Risacher was 8 lol. Paolo was 11. Wemby was 9-10. These dudes definitely group up in Stephs shadow || Ant? He already has like 27% of Steph’s record and he’s like 22 || >Nobody in the league right now is surpassing him

That’s a strong statement. Anthony Edwards clearly has a chance if he plays long the like and doesn’t get injured. I’m not saying he will with that high of a chance but it’s clearly greater than 0 percent. 

No one should ever make absolute statements like this.  || The fact that Curry wasn't an all-star player at the beginning of his career will make his record more accessible to break. People forget that he's still a late bloomer since he joined the NBA in 2009. I also don't think it will take a generational talent to beat him. All that person needs to be is a 3 point specialist. || What are you talking about? Kids in 2016 were already playing Currys game. 

It's just that 3 pointers are hard, so nobody is going to close to it anytime soon.

Either way I don't really buy the premise that they needed to be indoctrinated into the way of the three as children in order to do it. || luka has been firing off steph amount of threes since his rookie year he is an easy candidate if he plays 8-10 more years also wemby shooting 10 threes a game || Luka, Trae, and Donovan will all pass Steph in career 3s made. || did you read the post? || Reboundings impossible, games just so different now || I mean. Records can be incredibly specific so no, there are many records that can't be broken. but even As far as career totals in the 5 major categories wilt's 24k rebouds is unbeatable cause at the time there were damn near double the total rebounds. also wilt lacks longevity but played all the minutes. and ofc he was an incredible rebounder. duncan has the most between players drafted after 75 and he has just 15k. if blocks were recorded earlier wilt/bill blocks record would also be unbreakable cause they were 2 freaks and there were so many more blocks because of shots being closer to the rim on average.  stockton assist and steals record is also pretty unbreakable, not because of ""inflated stats"" but because that's what you get when you combine goat level longevity (6th in total games) with 2nd in career average apg and 7th steals. So that leaves us with lebron's record. Lebron's record is theorically beatable because of the fact that lebron's career average points of 27 is one of the highest but not the highest, especially now if the average stay this high. but still it's incredibly difficult cause lebron will probably end up being 1st in total games played. Lebron will finish this season over 42k points, i expect him to play 2 other seasons, but 1 is also possible so lets estimate 44-45k.

Stephen Curry,"""Stephen Curry"" OR ""Chef Curry"" OR ""Steph"" OR ""Curry"" OR ""Stephen""",2025-02-06,nbadiscussion,1ik9whm,Addressing the fictionalized past,"I’m getting so tired of hearing about the past. How the game was purer, better, grittier, more entertaining in the past. Tbh, I can understand oldheads who feel nostalgia for the Kareem era, Larry Bird/Magic Johnson era, or Jordan eras, but now we’re starting to wear rose colored glasses when we talk about the early to mid 2000s too?

It’s too much for me. Especially since I’m old enough to remember how utterly irrelevant the NBA was in the popular zeitgeist around the mid-2000s. As great as some of the players at the time were, nobody was a fan of the defense-first, interior bruiser style of play that dominated that era. Yet now that the game has evolved I hear non-stop complaints about things being different as if most people didn’t hate the previous iteration.

  
I'll make my position clear: the three point revolution was great for basketball and has brought this league to new heights of popularity, skill, and competing play-styles. I think I can also identify where the majority of this pouty, dissatisfied rhetoric comes from: the media and former players/coaches who make up a majority of that media. 

NBA media have tapped into the ""negativity sells' business model that is rampant among all journalism today. People react strongly to negative news stories, especially when they disagree with the position of those negative stories. Media has capitalized on this by constantly denigrating teams, players, front offices, coaches, even refs. It baits people into commenting to defend their team or clicking on lackluster articles for no reason other than to see where such a horrendous take is coming from. But there is another aspect to this, the players who make up the media today. They have become jealous of the inflated salaries and statistics of modern players and feel the need to bring down the current NBA in order to create a false perception that things were harder and better in the past. Silver and the owners should be looking really closely at this issue and going forward they need to do a better job at hiring people who embrace the evolution of basketball and make them the faces of NBA media. My bet is they won't do this because the ratings from negative stories are too appealing, but I digress.

  
Now I want to get to the real meat and bones of my argument, that the game today is better in every single aspect than it ever was throughout its history. So, let's address the elephant in the room, three point shooting. The development of three point shooting has been a purely positive evolution of NBA basketball, despite the whines you might hear from guys like Chuck Barkley or Stan van Gundy. I want to highlight why this development is so key to basketball being not only an entertaining sport but one that draws people from across the world in starting at a young age. 

* Accessibility through skill

Probably the biggest reason the three point boom resulted in such an increase in attention and devotion to the NBA is the accessibility that it brings to the game. I remember when Steph Curry started taking over the league, I was in high school at the time. Kids all started shooting from all over the place and kids who never seemed to care about basketball started to take interest. That is because shooting makes the league more skill-based while also making it more accessible to people of any size. I remember that in the apparently beloved days of the 2000s, you would commonly hear people detracting from the NBA with the classic ""all it takes is being really tall to get to the NBA."" But with the 3-point revolution, not only do big men need to be more than just a tall dude who stands in the paint, smaller players can excel and reach the league if they dedicate themselves and develop their 3-point shooting. Now, it isn't enough to just be a 6'11 lumbering giant with no touch or feel for the game. Big men need to be able to stretch the floor, handle the ball when needed, and see passing lanes they never had to tap into in previous generations. It also isn't a automatic rejection from the league to be between 5'11 and 6'2, kids can believe that if they work hard enough on their shooting and handling ability, they will be able to achieve their dream even though they weren't blessed with freak genetics. 

* Diversity of playstyles

So let's go back to the 2000s again. During the era of Shaq's dominance, basically every team in the league had to load up on those lumbering centers who could put up a fight against him in the paint. Every team would trot out a totally useless center who was just there to take fouls and be large. That isn't the case anymore. But big men with paint-dominant playstyles can still thrive in this league. Every time I hear someone complain about the lack of creativity or diversity of play in the league, I feel like they only ever watch a few teams and when they watch they clearly don't pay attention. The Celtics, Cavs, Kings, Rockets, Thunder, Knicks, and Bucks all play a drastically different style of basketball with different offensive philosophies and defensive schemes, but because most players can shoot threes that means they are the same? That is bs. 

* Scoring efficiency

Three point shooting has led to a drastic jump in offensive efficiency. This isn't defenses being bad today, it is offenses being extremely well tuned. This is the most complicated topic because I believe a lot of the jealousy of former players is brought by this change in the game. Because scoring efficiency and numbers have become so inflated, many modern fans look down on players of the past and dismiss their greatness because it supposedly pales in comparison to the modern day. This mindset almost necessitates the defensive arguments we see constantly from former NBA stars like Shaq, that the defense back in the day was just tougher. It is basically all they have to hold onto their position as all time greats, and if they let go of it all of a sudden people will start believing that Zach Lavine is better than Clyde Drexler or something ridiculous like that. But I want to propose a different explanation for the leap in efficiency and discrepency from past eras. It is because the skill floor has raised so significantly, causing the league efficiency to skyrocket. Now let's go back to the older eras. The all time greats of each era are the only thing that comes to mind when we look back, but if we were to really watch the games that wouldn't be what stands out at all. Going back to the Jordan era, his Bulls would have possessions where Bill fucking Cartwright is taking the ball out of Jordan's hands and posting up for an entire possession before kicking out for a terrible midrange shot. Nobody could shoot threes, so nobody guarded the three point line. When oldheads say ""defense was tougher back then,"" what they mean is that the offense was worse, so defenses could easily key into the most talented offensive players. This still holds true in today's game, btw. Think about teams in the past few years that have lacked shooting, or teams like the pistons the past few years that have only really had one or two capable players. It is a lot harder for guys on those kind of teams to put up mind bending stats like we see from the modern stars. That was what happened throughout the history of the league. The greatest players would be held back by teammates who weren't capable of complimenting them and bringing out their true potential. I actually think this makes some of those older players look even more impressive as they overcame the limited space they had to reach their achievements. 



What I'm trying to say is we need to stop letting media get away with making these asinine arguments that ragebait us into looking at them. The game is better than ever, and it is obvious if you look at the amount of money the league has been bringing in over the past decade. Anybody trying to tell you that the three-point revolution destroyed creativity is lying to you, and doing it to lift up the era they played/coached in or watched growing up. Not a damn soul would trade the league we have today to watch those 2000s offenses that shot 48% overall and took 25 long 2s every game. That was ugly as hell too. You can also think about it like this, imagine if Jordan or Magic had a spaced floor to work with. They would be totally unstoppable and the NBA would have exploded in popularity a lot earlier. It is the same group of old farts that held back the three point shot at it's inception that is now complaining about the league's embrace of that shot. We shouldn't let that go unnoticed. I love those old guys too and the way they played the game drove it forward, but the league during their time was more defined by the limitations of the average player than the earth shattering greatness of the legends even though that isn't how we like to remember it. The opposite is true of today's NBA.",55,20,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ik9whm/addressing_the_fictionalized_past/,2025-02-07 19:09:26,"So I would say the explosion in offensive efficiency is not purely a good thing in the sense that the game doesn't really feel balanced between offense and defense. Shots that constitute 'good looks' from 3 are just way too easy to generate and defenses don't really have a meaningful way to respond. This leads to the perception that teams aren't playing hard in the regular season and teams are just trying to jack as many 3s as possible.

I agree with most of what you're saying but I think the league should work to tweak the rules to try and give defenses more of a chance. It also doesn't seem like a pure positive that you must be able to shoot well to play in the NBA- it has gotten rid of a lot of diversity among role players which I think leads to the criticisms that all teams play the same way (even though that isn't really true). || I agree but think it goes both ways. People have completely ahistorical renderings of the past. 

For instance, Kobe Bryant was either the most efficient or second most efficient guards most years in the top 10 PPG list in the 00s. Usually, when he was he was not the most efficient, it was after guys like after Ray Allen or Kevin Martin who scored far less points per game than him. In terms of guards who were consistently in the top 10 in scoring season in and season out, he was the most efficient guard between Jordan and Harden/Curry. 

Kobe 06-07 is considered a shot chucker year for him. Yet he was the second most efficient Top 10 scorer in the league after Dirk Nowitzki despite being a guard and had a +4 relative TS%. He also led the league in scoring the same year!

To put that in context, the only player who ever was both 1st in TS% among the top 10 scorers and 1st in PPG is Curry in 15-16. Again, Kobe was 2nd in TS% and first in PPG.

You compare that to last season 23/24, the only guard within even the top 20 PPG list with a rTS% better than Kobe 06-07 is SGA. All-NBA Players in 23-24 like Steph, Kyrie (50/40/90) and Devin Booker with worse relative efficiency than Kobe last season are seen as highly efficient scorers. 

Players just use raw numbers like ‘record for scoring 25+ PPG at 65% TS’ to talk about modern players as being the greatest (ie better than the past) without taking relative numbers into account like 12-13 had 12 players who scored more than 20 PPG while 22-23 had 43. || > It’s too much for me. Especially since I’m old enough to remember how utterly irrelevant the NBA was in the popular zeitgeist around the mid-2000s. As great as some of the players at the time were, nobody was a fan of the defense-first, interior bruiser style of play that dominated that era.

I'm not sure how this claim holds any water when you compare the ratings. The 2004 Finals had an average Nielsen rating of 11.5, which is higher than every Finals from 2016-2024 (2015 averaged 11.6). Viewership has been at historic lows for the past five years (5.8 average for last year's Finals). If the NBA was ""irrelevant"" in the period you're speaking of, it's hyper-irrelevant now. || [removed] || I like how the NBA is right now, but it's a bit silly to say that no one liked 2000s-era basketball. || Thinking Basketball just did a really good video on this: [What former players get completely WRONG about today's NBA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp4but75EjY) \-- the criticisms don't really hold water if you're actually watching full old games vs. current games with any kind of a critical eye. || Thank you. I've felt this way awhile. Way too much hate in basketball and too many people who forget what the league was. Great assessment. || So glad someone said this. NBA posted a few playoff games from the 00's on YouTube. Teams scored 60-70 points the whole game. They used up the whole 24 seconds and ended up with a long two brick. How is that more entertaining? It's also a problem with many other things nowadays. Somehow everything is better in the past(even though they aren't old enough to witness the past), they believe that the world is evolving backwards. || [removed] || This is it completely. There is an imbalance in offense and defense. Look at the nearest defender numbers from the last 10 years. The 0-2 (tightly guarded) and 2-4 feet numbers are shifting each year to 4-6 feet and 6+ feet(wide open). That's efficiency on one side and a lopsided game to watch.

I don't think offense needs help anymore with the uncalled travels, moving screens, push offs called on the defender, and phantom defensive fouls. I'm sure there's more but they can start by being stricter with the existing rules by calling fouls against the offense and not penalizing defenders for attempting to be near the shooter.

I want to see defense be able to keep pace with the offense and maybe the open threes will slowly drop a little naturally and bring back a bit more paint and post play.

I don't think anything will bring back deep 2s for anyone but the best players who can still be efficient from there but I think it's wise for wide open 3s to be taken by good shooters but if defense is able to make those shots a bit harder, other shots may become a bit more efficient. || In cricket they always talk about 'making a fair contest between bat and ball'. The current NBA is not a fair contest between offence and defence. || Exactly, I agree with the ops overall thesis but to say the nba was irrelevant to the cultural zeitgeist in the 2000s is simply not true. From the early 2000s you had Iversons influence on fashion to the mid 2000s when LeBron, Melo, and D Wade were rising stars they had a lot of commercials. I guess it depends on how someone defines relevancy, even internationally the game was growing in Europe and China cause of the Olympics and players like Pau Gasol, Nowitski, and Tony Parker. || Well if Nielsen says so…

Look man idk exactly how Nielsen determines these things but 1. The NBA has grown exponentially in international popularity 
2. Most people don’t consume tv or events in the same way they did 20 years ago so it doesn’t seem like an accurate comparison 
3. The NBA’s profits have grown massively since 2014 which has multiple causes but seems to indicate people are more deeply engaged with the sport than the past
4. Finals is the series that will have the most engagement and doesn’t represent the overall investment or cultural impact of basketball || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || Probably because that’s not what I was saying at all. People still cared, but they care more now. There are more household name NBA players today and a lot more money goes into the league than back then because people are more invested. And what I mean by no one being a fan of the style of play was that it was common to complain about how slow the game was and ugly because of defensive domination. These things have changed and people don’t make the same complaints now.

I was really leaning into my point, but I definitely think at this stage allowing defenders more freedom of contact on the perimeter would be a good thing to balance out the game. I think that would also push offensive players to get even better and expose which players are capable of playing through tough defense and which rely on defenders giving more space out of fear of flopping and erratic refereeing. One other thing I think they should look at is the gather rule which already gets talked about a lot. || Exactly.

Stephen Curry,"""Stephen Curry"" OR ""Chef Curry"" OR ""Steph"" OR ""Curry"" OR ""Stephen""",2025-02-12,nbadiscussion,1iosh6c,Can someone help me with the last step of deriving this 3pt shooting metric?,"In this [article](https://fansided.com/2019/09/06/nylon-calculus-defense-adjusted-3-point-percentage/) Mike Bossetti walk through his creation of a metric he called defense-adjusted 3-point percentage, i'll give it a brief rundown but i suggest reading the article as well.

Using [nba.com](http://nba.com) shot dashboard stats he breaks down a players 3s by closest defender categories (0-2ft, 2-4ft, 4-6ft, and 6+ ft), calculates the league average 3PT% for each category and multiplies it by each players attempts to come to a sum multiplied by 3 to derive their expected points from 3s based on the shot difficulty. From this he compares it to their actual points from 3s to come to a points added metric which when converted from a counting to rate stat brings me to points added per 100 shots.

From this Mike partially describes how he goes from this rate metric to his defense-adjusted 3-point percentage stat in this paragraph:

""For a statistic to be effective, people want to compare it against numbers they’re already using. Saying that Curry added 25.35 points per 100 3-point attempts is nice, but without a subset to base it off of, we don’t have much to judge it against. Instead, we can look at how much value a player created per shot attempt, translate that to their “expected percentage above/below average,” and factor the league average back in for a “Defense-adjusted 3-point percentage.”""

From my understanding this would entail taking points added per attempt and finding the league average and then calculating a percentage better or worse than this average and using that and league average 3PT% to derive Defense-adjusted 3-point percentage, but I'm struggling with the math due to a statistic that centers around zero with positive and negative values.

If anyone could be of any help to solving this that would be much appreciated, here's what i've calculated for Steph Curry so far for example in the 2018-19 season. If anything else is needed I have a google sheets with my data so far [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11mHZsYdbQohGdQVPmhpf-Thp6UVtGge7Q4DGRlyRzDI/edit?usp=sharing):

|3PA|PTS|EXP. PTS|PTS Added|PTS Added/100 3PA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|801|1038|824.36|213.64|26.67|

\*EDIT\*:For those interested I figured it out:

By taking a players overall points scored from 3 divided by their attempts get their points per shot on threes. If you take this and subtract their expected points per shot and divide by their expected points per shot you get their percentage of points per shot above/below what would be expected of an average shooter with their same shot selection. Taking this + 1 and multiplied by the league average 3PT% gives you their defense adjusted 3-point percentage. For 2018-19 Steph the calculation would go as follows:

((PTS/3PA) - (EXP. PTS/3PA))/(EXP. PTS/3PA) = % PPS Above/Below Avg. Shooter

((1038/801) - (824.36/801))/(824.36/801) = 0.259 or 25.9% Above Avg. Shooter

(% PPS Above/Below Avg. Shooter + 1)\*League Avg. 3PT% = Def. Adj. 3PT%

(0.259 + 1)\*35.5 = 44.7%",53,4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iosh6c/can_someone_help_me_with_the_last_step_of/,2025-02-13 15:19:00,"Replying on mobile, sorry for math formatting issues.

At first glance this looks circular - you're taking 3p% per closest defender bracket, creating a composite accuracy statistic, converting it into a scoring/points-added metric, and now trying to convert it back again into adjusted accuracy.

The author of the original article isn't clear about this which is why you're stuck. It sounds like he's comparing his value added per-100 attempts stat to league average, which is 0. You're stuck here because you're comparing 26.67 to 0, if I'm guessing right.

I think the original author messes up here. He *should* be just going back to the percentages, but he's not. I think he takes the 26.67 and combines it with some values for that player's entire season-long attempted shot profile. What he's attempting to calculate is ""what is the league scoring average for this player's shot difficulty?"", but then he calls it a shooting percentage. 

Hypothetically, let's say for Steph what we see is that the average player shooting all of Steph's attempts scored x points per attempt - Steph scores x + 0.2667. Let's say that x is like, 1.4 or something (scored on 40% accuracy for easy math). So Steph is scoring 19% higher than expected. He then takes that 19% and tacks it onto the average shooting % for that player's attempts, so an average player's 40% shooting percentage over Steph's attempts becomes (40 * 1.19)%. This number (47.6%) is his ""defense adjusted"" metric. 

But since this stat is based on shooting percentages to begin with, you can just go back to the first steps where you calculate the league average per closest defender and just... don't turn it into points. Compare x player's expected accuracy instead of his expected scoring and you'll get to a similar result much quicker.  Plus, when you go back and forth between counting stats and percentages you're risking getting caught up in some dumb ratio math. 

The author is also trying to account for volume by basing it on total scoring across the season, but then goes back and turns it into an efficiency metric anyway - you could easily do the same exact thing by turning each bracket into a % of shots taken. 

Because of this circularity and how the article is written, I'm not sure this metric (real scoring compared to scoring on the same shot profile as shot by an average shooter) really has much value.  The author is describing it as if it reveals defender/scorer strategy when it really is just an above/below accuracy metric. By definition, bad shooters are worse than average, and good shooters are better than average. || I find this stat rly interesting and I was doing smth similar but wanted to take it a step further. Cause on one hand, sure it’s great that Steph curry or Klay Thompson hit contested shots at a well above avg rate, but often times that rate is still below the nba avg for wide open or open shots. And some players r better at, or r given more opportunity, to take open shots vs contested shots. 

Basically, I’d think it’d be cool if we could somehow also take shot quality into account wherein player A shoots way better at contested threes compared to nba avg but he also takes way more of these shots than avg, meaning that his overall percentage on 3s is middle of the pack and that’s a negative.

Idk how well articulated my comment is but I think the idea gets across somewhat clearly || If you take the league avg for a contested shot - either in one slice or across the range and compare it to Stephe Avg you’d get a percentage difference…IE league shoots 27% on (0-2 ft) while Steph shoots 33% [making these numbers up] 

Steph is +6% or he’s 33/27 % better…

If you normalized this rate to a points per 100 shot attempt you could say he’s (0.33-0.27)*3*100 =18 pts better per 100 shots ….

Think this is correct and what you’re after? || There was a whole study on how defense doesn't matter when it comes to 3pt shooting. Im surprised anyone tried to make this stat.

Stephen Curry,"""Stephen Curry"" OR ""Chef Curry"" OR ""Steph"" OR ""Curry"" OR ""Stephen""",2025-02-13,nbadiscussion,1ipg00j,Breaking TS - A Thought Experiment Part 3 (Continued),"

So here continues part 3 of this series, in an attempt that we should break this grip that TS has over Redditors/analysts as a good analytical stat. TS, in my opinion, is used way too much and its undeserved love has skewed the way that we think about the game.

The game of basketball isn't played with numbers on a spreadsheet, it's played on a possession-by-possession basis on factors that are constantly changing. Using a single stat to analyze the effectiveness or the efficiency of a player is the lazy person's approach to basketball, because doing the work of actually understanding a possession and its schemes takes too much work for them, and the context of possessions can not be dumbed down to numbers.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/s/35i0q787mF

In Part 2^, I displayed two different sets of differing statlines for people to decide or choose which is better. No one made any preferential comment, but there were some that still characterize the improper approach to thinking about TS. Someone for whatever reason made a long-winded tangent about TS, LeBron, Michael, and Jokic.

The first set was-

1. 26.3 ppg, 39% FG, 34% 3 PT, 11 FTA, 7.5/19.2 FGA. *0.548 TS*.

2. 29.2 ppg, 46% FG, 37% 3 PT, 8 FTA, 10.2/22 FGA. *0.545 TS*.

Many here attributed this 0.003 difference as noise and simply dismissed the comparison. The implication is that they're equal.

These are the statlines of James Harden 2013 Playoffs and Kobe Bryant's 2010 Playoffs. 

Here's the thing. I lied. Kobe Bryant's 2010 Playoffs TS wasn't 0.545, it was *0.567*. 

What was the purpose of this lie? To illustrate our tendency to ignore context simply because we can observe one number, which is TS. Many people fell for it, instead having the wherewithal to pause, ask some questions, and wonder if it was bs.
After all, I did provide enough of other statistical data- Kobe was more considerably more efficient from 2, from 3, from free throws, and the two statlines are on *similar volume*. Does it really make sense that that statline is less inefficient? 
Furthermore, if your takeaway is that I simply lied and tricked you, and you'd have gone with 0.567 TS anyways simply because the number is higher, you've still come away with the wrong conclusion. 0.567TS is only 4% more efficient than 0.545TS. Would you characterize a player as just 4% better than the other when it comes to scoring? 
When comparing the 2 point percentage, Kobe's 48.7% to Harden's 42.3% Kobe is 15% more likely than Harden to make a 2 point shot, and when comparing 37% 3 PT to 34% 3PT, Kobe is 9.7% more likely to make a 3 point shot. And as for free throws, Kobe will make roughly 5% more free throws. 
Pointing to a player only being 4% more effective scorer than the other due to the TS compassion is an extremely inaccurate *representation* of the quality of basketball played in both those statlines. Because throughout the flow of a game and determining which team wins, the player who is more likely to convert on a field goal is a more accurate representation of how good that player is in affecting game outcomes as opposed to washing context away with an overall summation of efficiency in one single stat.
And we haven't even gotten into gameplans, shot selection, shot difficulty, spacing, and matchups because those are massive factors that determine player effectiveness and efficiency. We shouldn't be using TS to say who's better, TS is a measurement that paints a tiny picture of what happened on the court. We should be looking into the conditions that create that measurement as opposed to using that stat to draw conclusions. After all, this is how science works. Numerical comparisons only make sense when all other factors are equal, and we do draw conclusions based off one number. Attempting to use rTS, relative True Shooting, still does not equalize those other factors. 

This leads me to the next set of stats comparisons. Set 2:

1. 28.5 ppg on 51.7/37.3/86.4 2 PT percentage is 0.575. True Shooting is *0.632*.

2. 29.6 ppg on 46/34.4/81. 2 PT percentage is 0.508. True Shooting is *0.57*. 

This should be quite obvious right? Statline 1 is much better than statline 2. If we were to decide which player is better (which people love to do on Reddit), you pick statline 1.

The first statline is Kevin Durant's 2011-2012 playoff statline.

The second is Kevin Durant's 2013-2014 playoff statline. 

If your conclusions that Kevin Durant was a better player in 2012 than he was in 2014, your conclusion is, again, very erroneous. Aside from the fact that the very obvious reality that players don't get worse, they only get better as they age until they leave their prime, the rest of the context matters much much more.

The 2012 Playoffs was the year James Harden was 6MOY, one year away from going to Houston and being his own superstar. James Harden was the backup point guard and often times he was the primary facilitator for OKC's big 3. It should be quite obvious- James Harden made life easier for Kevin Durant, as great point guards do, and that is reflected in Kevin Durant being more *efficient*, but thats not the same as being *better*. 

2014 was the year Kevin Durant won the MVP. He averaged 32 ppg, shot 50.3/39.1/87.3. He averaged a career high 5.5 APG. This was the year Westbrook missed considerable time. 
For comparison, 2012 regular season KD averaged 28 ppg, shot 49.6/38.7/86. Overall just barely barely less efficient. 

And this is the context we need when thinking about players, instead of thinking we don't need context when we look at TS% because it is an all-encompassing stat. When looking at full context you'll identify trends that explain numbers instead of numbers that explain the player. 

When it comes to Kevin Durant, his playoff numbers and efficiency are extremely high when he is surrounded by stars. His one season where James Harden was an emerging star and his runs with the Warriors are proof of that. When he has only one star OR the spacing around him is less than ideal, his playoff numbers drop rather precipitously. Kevin Durant's playoff averages on OKC are 0.455/0.33/0.848 on a TS of 0.575, where these are largely propped up by his 2012 Playoffs and to a lesser extent his 2011 Playoffs. His playoff efficiency is a lot closer to Kobe Bryant's efficiency (2006-2010), who played in the Triangle that basically did not value spacing or 3 point shooting.

Once KD joined the Warriors, his efficiency skyrocketed. But again, efficiency is not the same as actual quality or effectiveness of a player. Steph Curry was the engine that made the Warriors run. Teams focused more on guarding Steph and locking down Steph than they did KD. Durant was free to get a lot of isolation, facing limited double teams, or if he did could easily punish double teams due to the Supreme spacing around him. While I consider Kevin Durant to be the better player, it's clear that Steph was the more valuable player, or at the very least, the lineups with Steph and Draymond.
When KD left the Warriors to join the Nets, did that trend continue? The 2021 Nets finished second in the East, starring Harden and Kyrie alongside KD, were #2 in 3 point percentage, and #7 in assists. These stats reflect good ball movement and a high percentage of good shots generated within the team's offense. The playoffs were eventually derailed due to Harden and Irving missing time, but KD still put up crazy numbers. 

Fast forward to the next Playoffs, KD and the Nets were swept by the Celtics. Harden was out. Kyrie only played half the season. The Celtics crowded KD, and he averaged 26.3 ppg and shot 38/33 for an eFG of 0.428 and a TS of 0.526. This was in *2022*. 

So what was the point of all this? We take too much stock in TS, Kevin Durant's reputation is a reflection of that. We think that Kevin Durant is synonymous with extreme efficiency. After all he is 6'11, his mid-range and 3 are hyper efficient, and he easily shoots over defenders. He has insane TS numbers. He Generally takes tougher shots and  he makes them at very high efficiency. But this doesn't describe the more accurate reality of Kevin Durant as an overall scorer. If he's one of the most efficient scorers/shooters ever and does so by shooting over defenders and he passes adequately out of double teams, shouldn't that efficiency translate to the playoffs when defenses tighten? It doesn't, when Durant is surrounded with subpar shooting. It does, when Durant is surrounded by excellent talent and spacing. Efficiency =/= effectiveness. There's a whole lot more to the skills and habits players have, as well as the spacing around them that describe what a player can and can't do on the floor, which is a far cry removed from a reputation or conclusion we derive using TS as the primary or sole stat. 

I don't know if any minds will be changed, but here I've laid out an argument to change the way that many of us look at basketball. Many are quick to discard context and use numbers to formulate our analysis and conclusions when it's supposed to be the other way around. It's the context that formulates numbers. After all, this isn't how NBA teams and coaching plans and scouting reports approach basketball. They do not analyze players or formulate game plans based off stats like TS% or even advanced stats.

So, while the Celtics game plan was effective in shutting down KD, the constant double teams left the rest of the Nets shooters open and it wasn't actually a good defensive strategy.

TS% is just a calculation of a players total scoring efficiency from all metrics of scoring. rTS% is a metric which compares their TS% compared to that of league average.

Acting as if TS% is a bad stat because it doesn’t factor in the difficulty or quality of their shots is misunderstanding what TS% represents. 

Different positions and roles have different TS% and different averages. Shot creators have a tendency to have more difficult shots, which in turn makes their efficiency decrease. Players that play off-ball and have a lot of their offence generated for them tend to be more efficient. 

This is why players like Kobe, one of the greatest shot creators in NBA history, has league average efficiency, while DeAndre Jordan a guy who was an elite Center roll man has elite efficiency despite not making shots.

TS% and rTS% doesn’t have any problems with the stat, they just aren’t meant to be used as a single catch-all stat to explain how good a player is as a scorer. If they do, it just shows that they have a limited understanding of the statistic they are using (which is the same for any stat). || >0.567TS is only 4% more efficient than 0.545TS. Would you characterize a player as just 4% better than the other when it comes to scoring? 

>When comparing the 2 point percentage, Kobe's 48.7% to Harden's 42.3% Kobe is 15% more likely than Harden to make a 2 point shot, and when comparing 37% 3 PT to 34% 3PT, Kobe is 9.7% more likely to make a 3 point shot. And as for free throws, Kobe will make roughly 5% more free throws.

Not only does straight up lying drastically undercut whatever point you're trying to make, this is just falling for Simpson's paradox, Kobe's better efficiency on each individual shot type is cut into significantly because Harden, while less efficient at each individual shot has a more efficient shot diet overall.

Harden, takes 52% more 3s than Kobe as a fraction of his shots taken (38% to 25%), and since they're worth 1.5x as many points, even making them at a 9% worse clip than Kobe on that shot, Harden gains efficiency relative to Kobe based on increased volume of a better shot. 

Likewise with FTs, Harden made them at a 5% reduced clip but he took 11 a game vs 19.2 FGA to Kobe's 8 per game vs 22.6 FGA, for respective free throw rates of .574 for Harden and .358 for Kobe, a frequency difference of 60.3%. This results in Harden scoring 31% more points off his Free throws than Kobe despite being a less efficient shooter there.

Using [nba.com](http://nba.com) shot dashboard stats he breaks down a players 3s by closest defender categories (0-2ft, 2-4ft, 4-6ft, and 6+ ft), calculates the league average 3PT% for each category and multiplies it by each players attempts to come to a sum multiplied by 3 to derive their expected points from 3s based on the shot difficulty. From this he compares it to their actual points from 3s to come to a points added metric which when converted from a counting to rate stat brings me to points added per 100 shots.

From this Mike partially describes how he goes from this rate metric to his defense-adjusted 3-point percentage stat in this paragraph:

""For a statistic to be effective, people want to compare it against numbers they’re already using. Saying that Curry added 25.35 points per 100 3-point attempts is nice, but without a subset to base it off of, we don’t have much to judge it against. Instead, we can look at how much value a player created per shot attempt, translate that to their “expected percentage above/below average,” and factor the league average back in for a “Defense-adjusted 3-point percentage.”""

From my understanding this would entail taking points added per attempt and finding the league average and then calculating a percentage better or worse than this average and using that and league average 3PT% to derive Defense-adjusted 3-point percentage, but I'm struggling with the math due to a statistic that centers around zero with positive and negative values.

If anyone could be of any help to solving this that would be much appreciated, here's what i've calculated for Steph Curry so far for example in the 2018-19 season. If anything else is needed I have a google sheets with my data so far [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11mHZsYdbQohGdQVPmhpf-Thp6UVtGge7Q4DGRlyRzDI/edit?usp=sharing):

|3PA|PTS|EXP. PTS|PTS Added|PTS Added/100 3PA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|801|1038|824.36|213.64|26.67|

\*EDIT\*:For those interested I figured it out:

By taking a players overall points scored from 3 divided by their attempts get their points per shot on threes. If you take this and subtract their expected points per shot and divide by their expected points per shot you get their percentage of points per shot above/below what would be expected of an average shooter with their same shot selection. Taking this + 1 and multiplied by the league average 3PT% gives you their defense adjusted 3-point percentage. For 2018-19 Steph the calculation would go as follows:

((PTS/3PA) - (EXP. PTS/3PA))/(EXP. PTS/3PA) = % PPS Above/Below Avg. Shooter

((1038/801) - (824.36/801))/(824.36/801) = 0.259 or 25.9% Above Avg. Shooter

(% PPS Above/Below Avg. Shooter + 1)\*League Avg. 3PT% = Def. Adj. 3PT%

(0.259 + 1)\*35.5 = 44.7%",53,4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iosh6c/can_someone_help_me_with_the_last_step_of/,2025-02-13 15:19:00,"Replying on mobile, sorry for math formatting issues.

At first glance this looks circular - you're taking 3p% per closest defender bracket, creating a composite accuracy statistic, converting it into a scoring/points-added metric, and now trying to convert it back again into adjusted accuracy.

The author of the original article isn't clear about this which is why you're stuck. It sounds like he's comparing his value added per-100 attempts stat to league average, which is 0. You're stuck here because you're comparing 26.67 to 0, if I'm guessing right.

I think the original author messes up here. He *should* be just going back to the percentages, but he's not. I think he takes the 26.67 and combines it with some values for that player's entire season-long attempted shot profile. What he's attempting to calculate is ""what is the league scoring average for this player's shot difficulty?"", but then he calls it a shooting percentage. 

Hypothetically, let's say for Steph what we see is that the average player shooting all of Steph's attempts scored x points per attempt - Steph scores x + 0.2667. Let's say that x is like, 1.4 or something (scored on 40% accuracy for easy math). So Steph is scoring 19% higher than expected. He then takes that 19% and tacks it onto the average shooting % for that player's attempts, so an average player's 40% shooting percentage over Steph's attempts becomes (40 * 1.19)%. This number (47.6%) is his ""defense adjusted"" metric. 

But since this stat is based on shooting percentages to begin with, you can just go back to the first steps where you calculate the league average per closest defender and just... don't turn it into points. Compare x player's expected accuracy instead of his expected scoring and you'll get to a similar result much quicker.  Plus, when you go back and forth between counting stats and percentages you're risking getting caught up in some dumb ratio math. 

The author is also trying to account for volume by basing it on total scoring across the season, but then goes back and turns it into an efficiency metric anyway - you could easily do the same exact thing by turning each bracket into a % of shots taken. 

Because of this circularity and how the article is written, I'm not sure this metric (real scoring compared to scoring on the same shot profile as shot by an average shooter) really has much value.  The author is describing it as if it reveals defender/scorer strategy when it really is just an above/below accuracy metric. By definition, bad shooters are worse than average, and good shooters are better than average. || I find this stat rly interesting and I was doing smth similar but wanted to take it a step further. Cause on one hand, sure it’s great that Steph curry or Klay Thompson hit contested shots at a well above avg rate, but often times that rate is still below the nba avg for wide open or open shots. And some players r better at, or r given more opportunity, to take open shots vs contested shots. 

Basically, I’d think it’d be cool if we could somehow also take shot quality into account wherein player A shoots way better at contested threes compared to nba avg but he also takes way more of these shots than avg, meaning that his overall percentage on 3s is middle of the pack and that’s a negative.

Idk how well articulated my comment is but I think the idea gets across somewhat clearly || If you take the league avg for a contested shot - either in one slice or across the range and compare it to Stephe Avg you’d get a percentage difference…IE league shoots 27% on (0-2 ft) while Steph shoots 33% [making these numbers up] 

Steph is +6% or he’s 33/27 % better…

If you normalized this rate to a points per 100 shot attempt you could say he’s (0.33-0.27)*3*100 =18 pts better per 100 shots ….

Let's take a look at these early returns from this small sample of games.

The Warriors are 4-1. They are blessed with a relatively weak remaining schedule strength (22nd toughest remaining). 

120.2 OffRtg (≈2nd currently in NBA) 
107.8 DefRtg (≈2nd currently in NBA) 
12.4 NetRtg (≈2nd currently in NBA)

DunksAndThrees (EPM): 7th Net, 6th@Full-Strength (aka when Kuminga comes back).

How's Steph doing now that he has a Butler? 28.8ppg/5.4ast/4.2 reb on 47/40/84 splits.

Over this 5 game span he's at 6th OffRtg & 8th NetRtg in the NBA. Wow.

Per DunksAndThrees Steph is currently 4th in OffEPM and 12th in EPM on the season.

Seems like the game is opening up for Steph with Jimmy around. Here's some proof. Check out Steph's shot diet from 3.

Before: Open 3s: 33.4% frequency. Wide Open 3s: 15.9% freq. 49% Open or Wide Open 3s.

w/ Jimmy: Open 3s: 39.8% freq. Wide Open 3s: 18.1% freq. 58% 3s Open or Wide Open 3s.

~10% better! The Chef is cooking and The Butler is serving.

Given the Warriors relatively weak remaining schedule strength (22nd) and the fact that the Lakers, Nuggets, Grizzlies, Clippers, Suns, and Kings are all in the Top 10 in remaining schedule strength, the 6th seed, while tough to get to, is a real possibility. They will just have to keep up this momentum and take advantage of their weak remaining schedule strength.

Here's a fun fact from my deep dive on Post All-Star Break teams. Well, fun if you're not a Lakers fan. Per DunksAndThrees, The Lakers only have 10 games with ≥ 55% win probability for the rest of the season. They really could fall into the Play-In if they don't figure things out quickly enough.

Going 2-2 against the Jazz (2x), Hornets, and Blazers could be a sign of future danger for them. They seem to be built to win NEXT season when they can properly retool around Luka, as opposed to this season when they're relying on Jaxson Hayes to replace Anthony Davis defensively.

Concluding thoughts: it's only 5 games, but so far Jimmy has transformed the Warriors. The analytics are off the charts. Several other Western Conference teams now have some of the toughest remaining schedule strengths in the NBA. The 6th seed is a real possibility. And keep in mind that even before Jimmy showed up... The Warriors actually have a pretty good record against the best teams in the West. Does OKC or MEM or HOU or MIN want to deal with the Jimmy Butler Dubs in a Playoffs series? Could be dangerous.

Here's the Warriors record against Western Conference teams before Jimmy:
2-1 vs OKC; 2-1 vs MEM; 3-1 vs HOU; 3-1 vs MIN; 0-1 vs DEN; 0-3 vs LAL (but no AD now, different team); 0-3 vs LAC (Achilles heel?).

Any rational person would be hard-pressed to believe the Warriors are somehow going to be worse against these same teams with Jimmy Butler around. 

The Warriors really could make noise if they get the right matchup. Something special could be happening in the Bay.

They walk through some plays: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh4w7o8yOPo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh4w7o8yOPo)

The TLDR is that Jimmy's basketball IQ is off the charts.  He's easily one of the best in the game at using cuts and screens and a variety of actions off of those to create for himself and his teammates.  As I watched the video I was struck by the fact that Jimmy's offensive game is the polar opposite of Luka's.  Jimmy is a floor-runner in transition while Luka creates the break with long outlets.  Luka does his best work creating on the ball while Jimmy does his best work creating off the ball.  Jimmy is elite at screening and cutting while Luka is better off ball spacing the floor.  Isn't it interesting that we can have two so incredibly impactful players on offense and they both play in almost opposite ways-- what a game!  It got me thinking that I should show some Jimmy and Luka clips to my team to emphasize that there are many ways to be successful on offense. || A checked in, engaged Jimmy could benefit almost any team. With his playoff energy, they will be tough to beat. He is fully healthy after skating most of the year, plus time off for the suspensions.
Good pickup for the GSW || The Warriors just keep on finding ways to look terrifying. I mean, I think we all thought after Klay, they were just going to do a victory lap of mediocrity as Steph and Dray rode off into the sunset of their careers. And then this happens. I don't know if they have the firepower to play with the big boys because this team is SMALL, but that poises them well to make it deep in a Western Conference that is incredibly talented, but lacks consistent size across the conference. If they run into Denver, they are probably cooked, but if they can find a way to path through Houston, OKC, and find a way to run Edey off the floor in Memphis, there is a way for them to kinda ignore that deficiency. || Obligatory Lakers fan comment to clear up some misinformation.

You're using a 5 game sample size to draw conclusions about the Warriors. Then you use a 4 game sample that includes two games bookending the all star break to suggest the Lakers are in trouble. 

Why don't you use a 10 game sample, (starting the game after AD got injured and then later traded without playing again) where the Lakers are 7-3? That 10 game sample would show that the Lakers are 4th in defensive rating and 6th in net rating during that span. 

And that's without adding a fully healthy and conditioned Luka to the team. He's only played in 3 of those games and is clearly not himself after sitting out two months with a lower limb injury. This is Luka Doncic, the top 5 NBA player I'm referencing. 

I think the Lakers will be just fine. || The whole paragraph in the middle about the lakers was kinda weird. Good on the warriors though and especially on Jimmy. || Yeah let’s extrapolate from a 4 game sample with the all star brake in between and pretend the previous 4 months of ball didn’t happen. Warriors fans always out themselves as box score watchers. || It's pretty wild to me that people actually thought he wouldn't be an impactful addition. Sure he had injuries last year and he played pretty checked out so far this season but that was the deal. He was checked out.

Throw in Quinton Post as an out-of-nowhere serviceable stretch 5, and things get very interesting.

Didn't realise the strength of their schedule (or lack thereof) to close out the season was so positive for them and so bad for their top-6 spot competitors.  Let's see if this Butler transform keeps up, or if it falters due to injuries, lack of regular season fight or internal bickering (all things that can be historically attributable to Jimmy Butler and/or the Warriors in general). || In those 5 games the warriors played the Bucks without Giannis, the Rockets without Van Vleet and with Jaylen green returning form injury in limited minutes, Mavs without AD, a cratering Sacramento teams that just traded their biggest star and Chicago.

Only thing I've seen really geared towards the admin side of things. || I've also been interested in team logistics, equipment managers and travel logistics for all sports, draft war rooms, Olympic team gear hauls, things like that.


There's a channel on YouTube that used to visit a bunch of different team equipment managers. Shoe-wise, I think it depends on relationships between players and shoe companies (ie who sponsors a player). For sponsored players, they may know the kinds of shoes they like and make sure they send those, plus others to test out. Additionally, I think the companies send a bunch of shoes to teams for non sponsored players to pick from. And non sponsored players might be able to make requests, too (I don't know for sure though). At the end of the year, players have a bunch of shoes left over that they have shipped to their homes.


As with everything, it's all pretty logistically organized and streamlined so players don't need to think too much, except for what they have at home to support their job (ie the decision to have a personal chef, in-home gym, etc). Once they make decisions, there are many resources available from the team, the league, and good agents, to help them get things done.


Players and staff also have group chats which fills several purposes, but specifically when it comes to logistics, helps them organize get togethers (ie on Old Man and the Three, they had Jaren Jackson and Desmond Bane on, and they were asked a question about Steven Adams, and one of the stories was of a get together at assistant coach's house Darko (now HC at Toronto) where his gf cooked up a meal for Adams before the get together where he had several more chicken breasts. That's the sort of stuff that group chats would facilitate.


What was most interesting to me when I was first interested in team logistics, was all the stuff players travel with on the road. It isn't just what the social media shows with one carryon and a backpack. They carry PS4s; personal massage kits and cryo kits for their legs or arms or whatever, even torsos; podcasting gear; all sorts of stuff to make their lives easier and more comfortable on the road.


Equipment staff usually takes care of a ton of things and have to do so at the visiting arena a certain fixed time before the team arrives, so often they go straight to the arena upon landing, and there is a logistics side there to how many copies of different jerseys and equipment to bring depending on how long the trip is, I think including sewing (or maybe the home team lets them use their sewing as a reciprocated courtesy), in case of a new player that arrives midway during a road trip. They have to be prepared for every. Thing. And that brings up reciprocated services and hospitality by all home teams, where they let visiting teams, and players away from their teams, use their weight rooms, and I know the team I root for lets other players come by just whenever (within reason), especially if someone is rehabbing but coming through town for whatever reason, and wants to use the training facilities, the team tries to accommodate them.

Some NBA team vlogs have specific videos on Game Day prep with the equipment operations teams from ingress and egress of games and this shows how spoiled NBA teams are where these dudes behind the scenes barely sleep especially on those back-to-backs and late flights. There are also vlogs on team security staff of the Milwaukee Bucks making sure that things don't escalate on-court and coordinating with the logistics/operations teams on team security when moving in and out of cities.

Most of the equipment operation guys started out as ball-boys and eventually move up or were Assistants and the job is taxing one, given how big egos are in a pro sports team. They would need to know literally hundreds of items from socks, shirts, compression (pants, sleeves, tops, shirts, hybrids where one sleeve is longer), braces, shorts, multiple-colored jerseys, headbands, practice shirts, shorts, pants, tank tops, and A LOT of SHOES). 

When the NBA changed their rules of allowing teams/players to wear shoes that are not limited to primarily being their team's colorways, this also added another dynamic layer of logistics for them since they would need to consider the number of pairs each player has. Adding to the issue would be teams with multiple signature athletes, coordinating with their brands for specific colorways/releases ex. Christmas Day, MLK day, All-Star, Playoffs and etc. Normally a lot of players who aren't necessarily signed to a brand ex. Nike can easily request through the equipment team for specific customizations if they have bigger sizes beyond 16 or 17 or they would most likely have brand reps who would offer teams discounts on shoes/colorways that were mostly evident prior to the NBA attire/fashion rule change where shoes like Hyperdunks would be in team colors. 

They would also need to have multiple back-ups, of each item, and they must prepare and collect dirty gear and get them clean while the team is travelling, and this requires a lot of coordination with the other team's opponent if they are in the road and they assist each other with laundry and getting their gear in place in the arena or even practice facilities.

For team operations outside of the equipment, they definitely have internal team roles who handle the back-office/internal activities that a team does. It could range from sales/marketing, analytics, operations (including equipment managers), HR, administrative, finance and accounting, PR, communications which you would normally see in a typical corporate office and these roles are mostly non-basketball related. 

Hope this helps since I'm also a big fan of the NBA beyond the basketball aspects! || I was a security guard a few years ago for MLSE and Masai Ujiri would often leave his office door open so I would have to go in and close it but he had business cards with a common email on it, pictures of his family on his desk and a parking space with his name. Downstairs of his office is the leafs office, and around draft time they had a war room with players they wanted just written on a white board and after the draft they used the war room to discuss free agents they wanted to sign and what they expected them to get and what they were willing to pay for the free agents. It's pretty common that it runs just like a regular office. Fridges, lunch rooms, merch. But the raptors don't really have their own parking lot, they have Biometrics to get into locker rooms and practice court on the top floor of the Scotiabank arena. If the player doesn't have their ID card, then they have to go through a different entrance. I remember being at a door on an off day and 3 raptors walked in and very very politely asked if they can go to the gym upstairs and work out. I didn't recognise them because they weren't starters or anything n were in street clothes and I was like ""naw that's just for players"", and they told me their names and the guard I was with said ""y'all play for the raptors?"" And they laughed and politely said yeah we play for the raptors. Looked at their ID and called it in and they got an escort upstairs. Their locker rooms are pretty small to be fair, leafs one is cool but basic for it being a billion dollar franchise. Media room is just an open space with a drinks fridge and food set out.

And also, this has nothing to do with anything but when I worked there it was 2 or 3 years after the championship and there was NOT A SINGLE picture of kawhi Leonard in the entire arena. Pictures of the parade, no Kawhi, draft picks, no Kawhi, random players, no Kawhi. And they meet every year and discuss the pictures in the arena so it's a conscious decision to not put Kawhi in the building. || I was curious about logistics around a player being traded and found this interesting article ok group chats in the NBA 

https://hoopshype.com/2019/09/04/nba-group-rumors-chat-text-message-social-media-jokes-longform-trade/

Not really you’re question but still may intrigue you. || yeah I've always wondered how they specifically get paid. Are dudes just getting like 1 million direct deposited every two weeks? I mean I guess so but it just feels so crazy that's how it would be done. || If you’re interests exceed just the game of basketball and include pretty much pro sports as a whole, David Samson is a former GM and president of OPs for the Malrins. Sure it’s MLB but he has a podcast and he often goes on other pods like Lebatard Show to discuss the ins and outs of running a sports team. From how people learn they are traded and report to their new team, to how a team gets an arena approved and funded. It’s called Nothing Personal. || I love this question because I'm fascinated by it as well. In fact, during my (failed) degree in International Business Studies I worked out a case-study with a local football (soccer) club. This was the early 2000s in the Netherlands, but it is so much more complex than you'd imagine.

For example in football, the team manager is not the 'coach' (the man they call manager in football), it's a dedicated role and they are often supported by an assistant. Their role is to plan all logistics. Getting a football team with 30 people from one city to the other in the Netherlands is relatively easy, you hop on a bus and drive. But you also need all the kit, all the documentation, the hotel sorting, the fitness suite sorting, physio rooms etc. etc. They had check-lists for everything and these were constantly changed to meet emerging requirements, like a player needing sports tape or changing dietary requirements.

Between clubs, things are arranged with 'riders' like music acts and actors do as well, the hosting club describes what facilities will be available to the visiting team. But it's on a 'like for like' basis. If the team you are visiting is only providing you with bare necessities... well, then you only provide them with that when they return, right? There's a lot of unspoken rules and gentleman's agreements involved. 

Hotels tend to be booked as soon as the schedule is known and each club has good contacts with particular hotels/chains. Back then the team I studied had an agreement with Van der Valk hotels, a big chain in the Netherlands. They had just got quite far into the cup and were playing a team at the other side of the country, but all hotels were fully booked due to another major event in the area. So Van der Valk arranged a bunch of caravans on a nearby camping for the team to stay in. Apparently it wasn't very comfortable because they lost that game 3-1.

Training/exercise is run by the coaches/actual manager. But again, not in the way you'd necessarily expect. Every month they decide on the 'agenda' in a big meeting with the captain of the team, the physios/sports scientists. But I learned that it is different for each manager. Some prefer lots of team focussed training and a lot of team-wide stamina/cardio training, others draw up seperate schedules for sections of the team (defenders, attackers, midfielders etc.) and adapted for each player's individual needs. It is super intricate and I can only imagine that in the last 20 years that has only become more complicated. Add in that in the NBA the players have a huge say, many have their own personal trainers/chefs etc. So I think it's probably quite different in the NBA in that sense. 

Oh, before I forget, discipline was a huge eye-opener for me as well. The team agree fines at the start of the season, being late, swearing, smoking and drinking (a player told me a brilliant anecdote of being out in the city after a big win with a couple of others, they were drinking and pretty drunk on the main square, partying with fans, when the manager and assistant coach spotted them. Big no no! Cost them €1300 each, which was a week's wages at the time! Funniest thing: The manager was completely blottoed himself) but it's actually the team-captain that is in charge of that. He collects the money and depending on how much there is at the end of the season either organises a massive party, donates to a charity of his choice or a combination of the two. || That's a very interesting topic for me. Like, does LeBron have a company phone? Does he need to go through mandatory courses so he doesn't click on a phishing email and get hacked? || So LeBron exchanges emails, text messages, phone calls, Teams messages, in-person meetings, virtual meetings, and hand written post it notes with JJ. || I’d love to see the spreadsheets equipment managers have to track the extra gear each player wears. Arm bands. Wrist bands. Headbands. Shooting sleeves. Leggings. One-leg leggings. Knee pads. Mouth guards. The list goes on and on. || This is super helpful. I’ll check out those videos. Thanks. || That was interesting. It’s funny to read an article from 2019 that talks about group chats like they are some great advancement in technology.

Inpredictable: Warriors ranked 4th

Inpredictable: 54% probability of finishing 3rd-6th in the West (6th, the most likely, of course)

Out of curiosity, I took a comparative look at the first 8 games of KD & Steph and Jimmy & Steph

First 8 games: KD & Steph / Jimmy & Steph

KD & Steph (6-2): Steph 26/3/6 on 49/46/86 splits and 65.4 TS%

Jimmy & Steph (7-1): Steph 31/4/5 on 51/43/90 splits and 69.6 TS%

Imagine that... When you can't easily get away with doubling and tripling Steph all night, he's basically unstoppable!

I can't believe people were calling Steph washed when, per BBALL-INDEX, Steph's teammates rim shot making was in the 0.5th percentile and his teammates overall shot making was in the 4.7th percentile! And somehow, the legend that he is, he maintained a 5th or higher Offensive EPM and Top 12 EPM! What's he at now? Tied for 3rd Offensive EPM and 8th in EPM. HE'S ALMOST 37!

Notably, both Steph and Jimmy are Top 10 in NetRtg over this 8 game period. Only Cleveland has more players in the Top 10 in NetRtg during this span (3). No other team has more than 1. It seems the Warriors have entered truly elite territory.

Certainly, the relatively weaker schedule strength has helped the Warriors get off to this hot start, but it's worth noting that even before Jimmy showed up they've had a solid record against Top 10 teams in point differential and Top 10 teams in offense and defense. 

Per Cleaning the Glass: Warriors had the 5th highest win percentage against T10 teams in point differential and the 5th highest win percentage against teams that ranked in the Top 10 in Offense AND Defense.

Draymond's ring talk is wild, but the more you look at it, you have to at least consider the possibility of a 2022-esque run from the Warriors. The Pistons traded for Rasheed Wallace in 2004 and took down the Lakers in 5. Anything's possible. In the end, a lot of what happens in the Playoffs comes down to health and matchups.

They still don't have a solid enough 2nd 3pt shooter on the team to be true contenders. Relying on Hield/Moody/Post/Podz to provide 3s is just too shaky. Kuminga coming back should force Podz take less shots naturally, he's the perfect player if hes been taking 8 shots a game, he's been taking 10-18 shots sometimes. Kuminga isn't a knock down shooter either, teams with good tall lanky players are the perfect counter to this team as we saw even Jimmy struggles against teams that had such personnel like the Magic/Celtics/OKC. As far as this season goes, a lot of the success is gonna be contingent on how well Kuminga gets integrated for playoffs offense where starters are all playing 38mins+ a game. I would still be concerned with the lack of shooting with butler + draymond on the floor unless playoffs Jimmy comes back

This team is more primed to win a ring next year if they can add one more critical bench piece and get rid of hield. || I’m not gonna get to hot and bothered with the Warriors. Although they are 7-1 they’ve beaten 1 team in playoff contention, another in the play in, the Bucks without Giannis, and Steph had to go nuclear last night to beat the 7th seeded Magic. Of their 23 games left, 10 of them are against playoff teams. Even though they have been hot as fish grease I’m not gonna overreact until they face actual competition. I don’t think they’ll make it out the West cause for that to happen games like last night where Steph is the only player to score over 20 points can’t happen. || The team is pumped and they are playing well, but I need to see more from Jimmy. I know it’s a drastically different system for him and it’s going to take time to gel, but he hasn’t been shooting or finishing at the bucket. Everything on offense so far is drive kick or exploit a mismatch in the paint.  The foul baiting is nice, but where is the mid range shot? || This is a better team than the team that started 12-3. Podz and Moody are finding their groove, turns out Post is much better than TJD, and Jimmy is a perfect fit - no more 7-minute scoring droughts - and now teams can’t double-team Steph entire games. That being said, we’ll have a much better idea of how good they really are after the upcoming Pistons and Knicks games. Anyway, for them to win a chip, the stars will have to align perfectly - but I think their odds have gone up 25x or so - from about 0.1% to 2.5%! || I worry this is all a mirage, similar to the Warriors early season success. 

These wins/performances have come against lesser teams and we have one if the easiest schedules in the league for the remainder of the season. 

Our shooting efficiency woes have mostly continued and teams still seem to have good nights against us. We're still getting into a lot of close clutch games against mediocre teams, though winning them now. 

We need to play some of the more talented teams with them at full strength, but even then I'm not sure we will know much. Teams need more film on the Warriors with Jimmy to know how to play us. But will that be offset by JB getting more comfortable in the system?

Only time will tell. The Warriors are going to be a 3 or 4 seed most likely. I'm guessing no one will look forward to playing this enigma of a team. || [removed] || I think they’re a dark horse. Steph is picking up after having a rough midseason stretch, and Jimmy has definitively improved the team. Along with Kerr settling on more consistent rotations. All these things have benefited them. As long as they’re healthy, there’s no reason to assume they couldn’t make a decent run. The only real problem is banking on the health and consistency of three 35+ year olds. Warriors have okay depth but Steph, Jimmy, and Dray are gonna have to do some heavy lifting and really can’t afford to be off their game when it comes to a competitive playoff run. || [removed] || > They still don't have a solid enough 2nd 3pt shooter on the team to be true contenders

This is a weird requirement. The Warriors are 4th in 3PM.  

> teams with good tall lanky players are the perfect counter to this team .. personnel like the Magic/Celtics/OKC.

The Warriors are 4-0 vs the Magic since last season. They have played OKC as well as any team in the West the last couple seasons.  They also famously beat the Celtics in the finals not too long ago and have some bad blowouts recently but are still 2-2 vs Boston since last season. 

If there's any archetype GS has struggled against lately it's matching up with lots of size (Jokic, Twin Tower Twolves the previous 2 years, the Twin Tower Cavs). || I’ve definitely never heard the phrase, “relying on Buddy Hield to provide 3s is just too shaky.” But I haven’t been watching the Warriors || > they’ve beaten 1 team in playoff contention, another in the play in

This is just wildly inaccurate. They beat two playoff teams and 4 play-in teams. They played one team out of the play-ins and crushed that team by 38. 

> Of their 23 games left, 10 of them are against playoff teams.

Yes but still wildly misleading. 9-10 playoff teams remaining is exactly what you'd expect in a league of 30 teams, 12 seeds and 23 games left.  GS is done with the 3 best teams in the league and have the 2nd easiest schedule in the West. The Lakers have the 4th hardest remaining schedule and play 14 ""current"" playoff teams including 3 vs the Big 3.  The Nuggets and Clippers have the 3rd and 5th hardest remaining schedules. GS is likely to take over 6th seed by Monday. 

> don’t think they’ll make it out the West cause for that to happen games like last night where Steph is the only player to score over 20 points can’t happen.

The Warriors have won two rings with Steph as the only player over 20 ppg in the playoffs. Lots of other examples even with entire teams lacking a 20 ppg player like the 2013 and 2014 Spurs.  Watch enough ball and you'll see lots of great teams have balanced scoring and it's not a bad thing. || > We're still getting into a lot of close clutch games against mediocre teams, though winning them now.

They’ve blown out every team but two… the Rockets (not mediocre) and the Mavs loss (bullshit reffing). || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || Our sub is for in-depth discussion. Low-effort comments or stating opinions as facts are not permitted. Please support your opinions with well-reasoned arguments, including stats and facts as applicable. || Wiggins accounted for 10% of all fg3 made for the warriors this year and I doubt Jimmy is replacing his production. heild accounts for the 2nd highest at 16% and if you’ve watched recently he’s been pretty much cut out of the rotation, I doubt he’s gonna get more than 15mins in the playoffs if he’s not even getting 20 mins in the regular season because of defense . 

Moody is the only consistent player on the warriors outside of Steph that’s not terrible on defense while some what being able to shoot the 3. Post could be the X factor here but I’m not counting on a rookie to have significant playing time. And podemski well his regression kinda tells the story. 

So yeah I don’t have that much faith in the warriors secondary players to shoot the 3 that well just because they make a lot overall throughout this season as one major source or their production was traded away, the other Half will be targeted on defense to have meaningful game time and the remaining others not having historical volume to suggest they can just carry over the baton 


Yes and no on the okc, yes i know the record but that’s still just regular season and they’ve yet to play okc with hartenstein with holmgren as help. || Haven’t you followed Hield’s career? Dude is as inconsistent as they come: he can be above Steph level for 2 weeks, then turn into Shaq for the next 2 || Actually if you read the rest of that sentence you will see that I actually mentioned the 5th seeded Milwaukee Bucks, the 7th seeded Orlando Magic, 8th seeded Miami Heat. So the other teams they played are the Hornets, Mavericks, Kings, and Bulls.

I still don’t see how it’s misleading when I mentioned that 10 of those teams are playoff teams. I understand as a basketball fan that this is the NBA I get having a certain number of playoff teams remaining but also having a number of trash teams remaining trumping the playoff teams. The teams they have remaining not in the playoff picture are Philly, Charlotte, Brooklyn, Portland, Sacramento, Toronto, Atlanta, New Orleans, San Antonio, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Portland, these aren’t top teams. These aren’t contending teams. These are bottom of the barrel, basement dwelling teams (excluding Atlanta cause they in the 9th seed but still). These are teams fighting for draft position in July not for a playoff spot in April.

Now to the 20 point argument. All I said was you can’t count on Steph to drag them out of a whole every single night. It took him going nuclear and scoring 56 to beat the 7th seeded Magic by 6 points, not by 30, or 25 or 20 or 10, 6. He scores 49 points they lose, he scores 40 they lose. He needed to go nuclear for them to win and you can’t count on him to do that every night but on the other hand Quentin Post did score 18. But you can’t count on 18 from him. The 2014 Spurs was some of the most beautiful basketball to ever grace this planet. I even go back and watch basketball from that season cause it was so beautiful but that team isn’t this Warriors team. Yes those 2 Steph titles were him going over 20 per game and him only and while that is an impressive feat in itself that was Steph at 26 and 33 not a 36 year old Steph (not knocking the age). It not sustainable to count on a Steph bailout to win a chip. || Orlando was also a close game (clutch by NBAs definition), so that is 3 out of 7 games. || > Wiggins accounted for 10% of all fg3 made for the warriors this year and I doubt Jimmy is replacing his production. 

Butler won't directly but he makes it easier for Steph and others to get open.  Steph's production is up with Butler, +0.5 3PM (not even including last game which spikes it much higher) and he's sat several 4th quarters.  

Also TJD minutes -> Post minutes replaces a lot of Wiggins 3P production. In fact since 2/8 Post has averaged the same 3PM per game as Wiggins did (2.0) in half the minutes. That's not sustainable but shows part of how you can replace Wiggins' contributions ""in the aggregate"" as the saying goes.  Not that you have to 100% replace him, I mean the offense has been incredible with Jimmy and the spacing with Post, does it matter exactly where they are getting the buckets from?  Is Jimmy getting to the line instead of Wiggins chucking 3's bad?  

Not enough 3P is just a weird invented requirement -- the Nuggets were like 18th in the league in 3PM when they won, against the Heat who were like 17th -- and on top of that it doesn't fit the Warriors all that well. They shoot a ton of 3's and make a lot.

> heild accounts for the 2nd highest at 16% and if you’ve watched recently he’s been pretty much cut out of the rotation, I doubt he’s gonna get more than 15mins in the playoffs if he’s not even getting 20 mins in the regular season because of defense .

[Hield does't have a single month under 20 mpg this season](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/buddy-hield-mpg-by-month-this-season) and has played more mpg in February (24.2) than any other month. They didn't go all in on Buddy when he was shooting 50%+ and they didn't put him at the end of the bench when he was in the low 30's. He's definitely in their playoff rotation. 

> podemski well his regression kinda tells the story. 

I think he had a terrible 6 weeks with The Mask but he's been at 38% since early December on 50% higher volume than last season (same minutes). || I believe he was being sarcastic. || > the other teams they played

The teams they've played have had a roughly league average w% and SOS. Their opposition isn't the story, they have a great record against some solid, some mid, and one very bad team.  

> I still don’t see how it’s misleading when I mentioned that 10 of those teams are playoff teams.

It gave the impression that the Warriors had a particularly difficult upcoming schedule when the opposite is true. The fact that they have an easy schedule remaining only increases their chances and eventual seed.  

> All I said was you can’t count on Steph to drag them

That is not true, you said ""games like last night where Steph is the only player to score over 20 points can't happen"" which is just bananas wrong, many champions have lots of games where the 2nd scorer is just under 20. || 3 out of 8… || Saying they can’t count on Steph to drag them is saying they can’t count on Steph every single night when everybody else struggles to score 50 and win the game. Yes many champions have had these games and there is no doubt but when a team is fighting for the playoffs and they have been inconsistent the first 60 games of the season and now they have a chance to make the playoffs, Steph can’t be counted on to win these games for them.

Admittedly, I too, found some of these narratives convincing. You likely have reservations about one or more of these narratives. It is irrelevant whether or not these narratives are true. Players are devalued and valued based on things they largely have no control over. Regardless of whether you believe these narratives or not, they are ubiquitous in NBA discussions. All of these narratives are dependent on these outcomes decided by near inches or close games: Ron Artest's 2010 Game 7 Finals 3pt shot, Kyrie Irving's Game 7 Finals 2016 3pt shot, Kevin Durant's game-tying shot in Game 7 2021 ECSF, JR Smith's blunder in Game 1 of the 2018 Finals, Kawhi's Game 7 buzzer-beater in the 2019 ECSF, Jason Kidd's infamous momentum killing timeout in last year's 2024 Finals in Game 3, Game 6 Klay in the 2016 WCF, John Paxson's clutch shot in the 1993 Finals, Steve Kerr's clutch shot in the 1997 NBA Finals, 2002 WCF Game 6 Kings vs Lakers, Ray Allen's clutch shot in Game 7 2013, Game 5 1994 Bulls vs Knicks ECSF (Hue Hollins) call away. These are all moments that could have gone either way and should not define a player's legacy (the most overused word in NBA dialect nowadays) or their impact on winning basketball games.

All of these narratives are also dependent on injuries: Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving injuries in 2015, Draymond Green's suspension in 2016, Kevin Durant missing the 2015 playoffs and the entire 2020 season, Westbrook missing the 2013 playoffs after his meniscus tear, Steph Curry missing most of the 2020 season, Chris Paul getting hurt in the 2018 WCF, Kawhi's injury in the 2017 WCF, Klay Thompson tearing his ACL and Achilles, LeBron tearing in groin in 2019 and missing the playoffs, Kevin Garnett getting hurt in 2009, and I could keep going but I won't for brevity.

Some of these narratives depend on the situations of players drafted to not-ideal situations or bad front offices: LeBron was drafted to a mediocre Cleveland team in 2003, Kevin Garnett's time with Minnesota was plagued with misfortunes (like the Joe Smith situation, among others), OKC let go of James Harden and Demarcus Cousins was drafted to the Kings.

I find something wrong with denigrating or valuing players based on injuries they cannot control or outcomes that could have gone either way. Instead, players should be valued based on their individual performances and their impact on winning in a large enough sample size. I don't know what the sample size is so you can decide that. Maybe we need 40 playoff games to determine how well a player performs in the postseason. If so, then we should need around that same amount of regular season games to see how good a player is in general. I find it logical to value postseason performance more than regular season performance and most of us already do this.

You can have players who are individually excellent and impact winning tremendously (Jokic), players who are individually excellent but don't impact winning (Kevin Love in Minnesota), and players who are not individually excellent but impact winning (Draymond Green). Yet, some people value Draymond Green over Kevin Love or vice versa. That is an interesting conversation to have. It's not interesting to simply say ""Draymond has more rings than Kevin Love, therefore he is a better player"" because their circumstances are so different. I once thought like this as well, but I think it is a lazy attempt for our brains to make conclusions on highly variable situations and circumstances between players with completely different teammates, coaches, front office, the era they played in, etc.

As most of us know, individual players' stats do not tell the whole story and are not consistent indicators. Looking at box score numbers to determine a player's impact does not reveal that player's true impact. You could look at Box Plus-Minus, Win Shares, DBPM, Net Rating, PER, DARKO, or whatever other metrics to find the most impactful basketball players. A player's impact should be the only thing that matters when evaluating a player's greatness. We know Jayson Tatum impacts winning, but that does not stop someone from saying ""Oh, but he didn't win Finals MVP"". I think we need to stop this infantile level of discussion. I am guilty of engaging in this type of discussion myself. Whether we should value individual performances over impact on winning depends on the situation and that is a conversation we can have.

When I use ""we"", I am referring to some NBA fans, not all. Intangibles like leadership, mental toughness, and poise under tight situations, play a role in player evaluation, but it is unfair when the NBA community says ""X player is not a leader"" or ""X player is not clutch"" or ""X is soft"" when we are not in the locker room with that player and we cannot possibly have an inkling of knowledge on these intangibles. We use a few clips or quotes to make these conclusions about players without knowing the full story and circumstances behind a player. We use the stats of said player in the clutch as a way to be objective, we say, yet each clutch situation is highly different with varying circumstances. Instead of how players perform in the clutch under relatively similar conditions (we say it's too much work to do this), we just throw out the clutch stats of one player against another to make our conclusion. I must admit I have done this myself when debating with others on this particular topic. These types of conclusions are frankly lazy and we should do better as the NBA community.

We devalue LeBron James for his series against the Mavericks in 2011 and attribute none of that loss to the Mavericks' game planning, we blame Steph Curry for ""choking"" in 2016 and narratives persisted for years that he was not clutch even though that 2016 Warriors team was minutes away from winning the title, we say Jordan was 1-9 in the playoffs without Scottie Pippen as ""proof"" that Jordan is not as great as we say he is, we say that Kobe's legacy was ""saved"" thanks to Ron Artest's shot in Game 7 2010 Finals, we say that Westbrook is a selfish stat padder who will never win a title, among other narratives that try to make simple conclusions for outcomes. As a specific example, we forget that Iverson's 2001 76ers could have faced Vince Carter's Raptors in the ECF instead of the Bucks if Vice Carter hadn't missed that game-winning shot in Game 7 against the Bucks in the semi-finals. We don't know the outcome of a 2001 76ers vs Raptors ECF, but people would not be idolizing Iverson for ""dragging"" that 76ers team to the finals. We see Vince Carter as one of those very good players, HOF worthy, but not ""one of the greats"", when it's very possible he could have led his team to the finals in 2001 which would have given him extra ""legacy"" points. This is just one example out of many of how we elevate and denigrate players based on non-deterministic outcomes determined by mere inches.

The biggest problem is that NBA discussion is based wholly on simplistic narratives instead of actual basketball, which I am aware has already been talked about ad nauseum.  Whether a team wins a championship depends on so many factors including team chemistry, front office decisions, games decided in the last few seconds/minutes, playcalling, competent coaching, etc.

I could be wrong here, but I do not find it convincing that superstar players are the main reason for their team's success. They are the most consistent contributors to a team, but an individual player is almost never responsible for more than 50% of the team's offensive production. We say that Nikola Jokic is carrying the Nuggets this year. As of today's date 02/27/25, Nikola Jokic is averaging 29.2 ppg, 12.6 rpg, 10.4 apg (source: https://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/\_/name/den/denver-nuggets). He's contributing to 29.2 + (10.4 \* 2 < x < 10.4 \* 3) points, somewhere along the lines of 50 ppg for the Nuggets. Yet, the Nuggets score 121.3 ppg. The overall team collectively is contributing more than Nikola Jokic individually even though it may not seem that way when watching the games. The Nuggets have struggled this year, but it's not because of Jokic. This is an oversimplification of this point just for clarity. We expect a superstar's team to win when they have a 30-point triple-double or when they drop 50 points. We expect superstars to ""carry"" their teams to titles when basketball is a team sport. The idea of a ""#1 option"" or ""#2 option"" is another way for us to categorize players in a simple way. Fans, including myself, are obsessed with individual heroics. We blame superstar players when their teams lose. We call these players ""chokers"" when they perform poorly in playoff games. We say these players are not clutch or they are not ""killers"" like Kobe or MJ. If given a large enough sample size of poor performances in playoff games, then it is fair to conclude a player cannot perform consistently well in playoff games where teams are game planning against them (James Harden comes to mind, perceived as a choker, whether or not this is true is irrelevant). Yet, how many times have we seen a player have historic performances, yet still lose? Examples include:

Jordan's Bulls vs Celtics 1986 averaging 43.7/6.3/5.7 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1986-nba-eastern-conference-first-round-bulls-vs-celtics.html),

LeBron's Cavs vs Warriors 2018 averaging 34/8.5/10 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2018-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html),

Curry's Warriors vs Raptors 2019 averaging 30.5/5.2/6 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-finals-warriors-vs-raptors.html),

Durant's Thunder vs Heat Finals averaging 30.6/6/2.2 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2012-nba-finals-heat-vs-thunder.html)

We fail to realize that individual heroics do not always transcend the team's collective performance and they often do not. We shouldn't penalize players for that.

This is why player rankings, GOAT debates, and the aforementioned narratives lead to unfair discussions of certain players. If you've been watching the NBA long enough, you'll find these conversations stale and dull, for good reason. Looking at the most impactful players, basketball strategy, game planning, players and their individual performances is a much more fruitful conversation than only comparing the most accomplished. It's easy to compare the individual accolades between players. It's harder to compare their impact only.

We elevate players for winning MVPs, DPOYs, championships, All-NBA teams, and All-Defense teams when these are highly dependent on the talent in the rest of the league. It is unfair to elevate one player who has an MVP over another player who does not solely based on that accolade. When I compare two players, I ask myself this question: If I swap the individual accolades of the players I am comparing, does that change my perspective of them? Of course, the exception is players who would never win certain accolades in any era (Tony Allen likely never wins an MVP in any era and Isaiah Thomas never wins a defensive accolade in any era for being 5'9). If I swap the accolades of LeBron James and Michael Jordan, does that change your perspective of each player? If I change the circumstances (where they were drafted, front office decisions, teammates they have, etc.) of one player with another, does that have any effect on the careers of said players? The answer to both questions must be yes and it likely is for many readers. That is fundamentally a problem with how we evaluate players. We cannot make conclusions about an individual player's greatness based on their accolades or championships because these are situational and circumstantial. Many players who have won MVP would never have won MVP while playing in the 1990s while Michael Jordan was playing. That's not to undermine their incredible accomplishments, but context is needed especially when comparing and evaluating players.

I think that the only fair way to determine the value of a player is the impact they have on winning basketball games and their individual performances. Winning crucial playoff games and titles is dependent on much more than a superstar player's performance. I do not need to see Luka win a title to know he can be the biggest contributor to a championship team. He's transcendent enough to where I do not need to see him to do that to believe it. I don't need to see Jayson Tatum win an MVP to know he's an incredible basketball player. James Harden's Rockets were 27 missed threes away from advancing to the finals in 2018 yet according to NBA Twitter, he could never win as ""#1 option"" on a team. Yet, individual talent transcends being in varying situations. This is why superstar players who are healthy and in their primes consistently produce and don't average 30 ppg one year and 16 ppg the next despite being surrounded by different teammates, opponents, and coaches. Even being able to perform consistently among those wildly different conditions is praiseworthy (can we stop saying glazing whenever we praise someone?) to me. As such, the only fair criterion for players is their individual performances and how those performances elevate (or don't elevate) their teams. We've seen players be great individually but not consistently elevate their teams.

Because the playoffs have fewer games than the regular season, it is incredibly unfair to judge players solely based on that. Every single player has had bad games in the regular season, yet they cannot have bad performances in the postseason? The outcome of a basketball game is much more complex and has more variables than a superstar player's individual performance.

All that to say we should definitely value players who lead teams titles, especially more so when a player dominates the competition. All of these accomplishments contribute to the GREATNESS of a player, but not whether they are a better player than another player by themselves. Intangibles also matter a ton, but it is tough to evaluate them specifically. I find that when people talk about a player's intangibles, it's all about gut feeling. Please let me know if there is a way to evaluate a player's intangibles fairly. I personally must refrain from talking about intangibles because evaluating a player's intangibles is subject to our preconceived notions, biases, and prejudices, all of which I have. We're not in the locker room with a player, we're not aware of what they say or do in the huddle during a timeout, we don't know what the player says to motivate their teammates before a big playoff game, and we as NBA fans often do not have the knowledge to make conclusions on a player's intangibles. Of course, intangibles matter, but most NBA fans, including myself, do not have the information to evaluate them (even though we think we do). There is a reason many people question the validity of Bill Russel's 11 championships. It's because competition is a factor. There were only 8 teams and 9 Hall of Famers were on that 1960s Celtics team. Despite that, Bill Russel is (and should be) an all-time great but we often say Jordan was better for a multitude of reasons. The only thing that should matter is whether a player performs well and whether their performance elevates their team.

I just wish we were in a world where NBA fans could discuss basketball in its purest form instead of endless, unfounded narratives and dull debates about ""Who's the GOAT?"", ""Can X player be the #1 option on a championship team?"", ""Does X player have that dog or killer instinct in him?"", ""I need X player to drop a 40-point triple-double to win this game"", ""X player cannot carry a team"", ""X player will never win a ring because Y"", ""X player flat-out choked"", etc. Why can't we talk about a team's game plan against a superstar player to slow them down, why can't we talk about or argue how a player's individual greatness either elevates or denigrates their team's overall performance? Why can't we talk about role players without demolishing them for not being the biggest contributors on their teams? Why can't the NBA talk about actual basketball strategy? Talking heads like Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith who know very little about actual basketball strategy behind it have perpetuated these narratives for decades and it has seeped into NBA fan discourse.

TL;DR: I believe that when comparing and evaluating NBA players, we should only look at their individual performances, impact on winning, intangibles, and pure basketball strategy (game planning, defensive schemes, offensive schemes). Not winning titles or accolades only. A particular individual winning an individual accolade (MVP, Finals MVP, All-NBA, All-Defensive, All-Star) does not by itself make one player better than another. This is because these awards are based completely on the competition and the era you play in. A player winning a championship does not by itself make one player better than another. Most of us who have followed the NBA for a while already know this. This is because there are incredibly varying circumstances, injuries, and outcomes that affect winning titles or accolades.

If I could summarize my argument in one sentence, it would be this: Narratives that do not relate to individual performances, impact on winning (there is a difference between the impact on winning and winning), intangibles (I only trust evaluations of this from players, coaches, front office members, or other insiders of an NBA org), or basketball strategy are lazy and unfair attempts to evaluate players.

Again, I could be mistaken on all of this so please let me know what you think. I am open to being corrected about anything here.

>intangibles (I only trust evaluations of this from players, coaches, front office members, or other insiders of an NBA org

This part is specifically tough. For example, the Mavericks or Wolves just trade a guy like KAT and Luka, which by intent means they do not believe that those players can help them win, but is that a fair assesment? Its hard to predict the future regarding picks and trades. || This is not a very good post for a variety of reasons, but I'll point out just a few:

This is straightforwardly wrong according to the same advanced stats that you advocate for above. [Nikola Jokic has contributed 7.6 of Denver's 10.9 VORP this year](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DEN/2025.html). A team with Jokic and 11 veteran-minimum players would almost certainly be better than the Nuggets minus Jokic.

Does Tatum have the same impact on winning if he got drafted to the wizards instead of the Celtics. Does Jokic put up the same performances if Luka is on his team.

For those who prefer a quick summary, I used AI to condense it:

NBA player evaluations often rely on oversimplified narratives, championships, and awards, overlooking basketball's team-oriented nature. Players should be assessed based on their individual performance, impact on winning, and strategic contributions, rather than just titles, clutch moments, or vague intangibles like ""killer instinct."" Factors like injuries, luck, and team dynamics are often beyond a player's control, so discussions should focus on deeper basketball analysis instead of reductive debates.

This is part of the world we live in where entertainment companies of all sorts are constantly competing for our attention. People naturally have a short attention span when surrounded by novelties. And some of the headlines which have come out of sports in the past five or ten years are downright sensational. 



Along with that, there has always been a tendency among sports fans to have endless conversations about hypothetical matchups or career comparisons or talent levels. Combine that with our overexposure to bombastic media and we get these exaggerated takes on sports reddits. 



The same thing is happening in everyday speech. We all know how often people say “literally” these days. I don’t know if it’s because people are subconsciously becoming desensitized to descriptive language, but hyperbole seems to be on the rise. “X must be protected at all costs” “I’m literally dead” “James Harden is literally hitler”



Obviously these are meme phrases, but this kind of language exists all over the place, not just in sports. You are definitely picking up on this phenomenon where powerful language is more popular than rational discussion. Is this new to our digital age? Have people always had over-the-top arguments with each other? It’s probably a little of both. Whatever it is it’s everywhere and it certainly hasn’t spared the NBA. || Its simple...

But to your point, the trade is not ""pure basketball,"" yet it had (and still has) an enormous impact on the accolades that people like to use to evaluate players. 

The Celtics got to fast forward through rebuilding. Tatum and Brown joined a winning franchise, and got meaningful playoff experience from year 1. I'm a Celtics fan and I think Tatum is incredible, but when people bring up how high his playoff points are for his age, it's impossible to ignore that he was a #3 pick (and would have gone #1) who joined a team that won 53 games and made the ECF the year before he was drafted! That's not a knock against him, it's just a reminder that players exist in a broader context that has nothing to do with their basketball skills.

So as a result of thier nostalgia every discussion regarding a different generation just boils down to handchecking this or no defense that and todays game has soft players....

The media donesn't even appreciate the current style of basketball. As an example when people say there is no defense in todays league, thats just a surface level statement. If you actually think it througj the reason why defense is not as noticeable is bc todays players are just unguardable and the quality of the average NBA player is miles above the 90s. The current superstars would have been unguardable in any era. It wpuldn't matter how personal MJ takes a matchup he is not guarding Curry or Durant better than todays players.

So will the 2010/20s be remembered as fondly as the 90s today in 20 years once the media is filled with people who grew up with this gen of players?",155,135,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j11089/will_this_era_be_the_gold_standard_in_20_years/,2025-03-01 09:45:47,"It usually is. That’s not just basketball but life. Music, movies, culture was best when you were in your formative years to early 20s. 

I grew up watching post Jordan and that was peak basketball for me. Tmac, Kobe, vinsanity, iverson, Tim Duncan. Everyone I know would try to emulate Kobe’s fadeaways and AIs crossover playing pickup. But many say that is the worst era of basketball, with teams barely scoring over 60 in pistons spurs finals. 

I’ve grown to appreciate all eras. This era has an incredible depth of talent with the goat shooter in Steph, incredible passers in jokic, Luka and LeBron, athletic freaks of nature in giannis and wemby. With more money in the league I’m sure the next wave will only be more talented. || My totally unfounded prediction is that minor rule changes will make 3 point shooting more difficult, and people will be saying “back then even centers could shoot the three” || [removed] || Yes and no

The younger gen’s will diss the the 2010s and 2020s in the 2030s and 2040s and all of the people today who diss the 80s and 90s will be acting like the old heads of today. If anyone goes on Instagram or social media and sees comparisons between Wemby and Bron or something like that it’s already happening in the comments (Bron fans saying his era was tougher, etc). 

If “young” people (under 25) here think that’s not going to happen you’re in for a rude awakening. Remember - kids born in the last few years won’t fully know who Bron Durant Curry were as in they wouldn’t have watched their careers as they happened just like those that didn’t see MJ or Kobe. 

I think there was a viral video where kids in elementary school were calling LeBron overrated for example (obviously they don’t know better but still). 

When it happens in full stride and people point out the hypocrisy in about 15 years it’s going to be pretty funny. Just being honest. 

Also I’ve noticed when speaking with people sometimes that they think that this era has peaked with talent and it won’t get better. That’s another rude awakening waiting when they speak to people 10-15 years younger than them years from now who say the league is better than ever. 

I think it’s better/easier to just respect all eras. || Okay, I still love basketball and appreciate the skill set of the guys today. this is the most talented era ever…there’s 30 teams with 13 guys who can play, and there’s more talent overseas and in developmental leagues that would justify spots on rosters. Just by numbers, the talent is better today than ever before.

But the gripes from old media types isn’t all unfair. You say that guys today are unguardable and I agree. But it’s not because they are just that good. It’s that the leniency on what a carry is and the legislation of the zero dribble and gather steps has made it damn near impossible to play defense. It really doesn’t matter. So to their point, sorta like with NFL’s strict no touching on defense and baseballs juiced balls, we are watching a highly imbalanced battle between two teams. And for a lot of people, that’s not the game they love.

But again, I think this generation will probably be fondly remembered because again, the skill set is better than ever before and the depth of talent is legit. And the players now are smarter/more personable than we’ve seen in a while because the money is so big that corporate entities or handlers groom them to be business-adjacent products from an early age. || Respectfully, I don't agree with your premise. While dismissing the current era is wrong, 90s basketball isn't glorified because of nostalgia, but because it was *really* good basketball. I don't know why people have such a hard time accepting that while things now can be great, that there really were Golden Ages.

Now, to answer your question more directly, I think Warrior's dynasty era will be remembered as a great era, but I don't think the last ~5 years (really, bubble onwards) will be. The Warriors/Cavs era was so good because the style of play that everyone plays now was really invented at this time. Things were going on then that people hated (flopping and ""traveling""), but the teams that were mostly doing all that never won. Now, everyone is really just imitating without innovating the game. And to make matters worse, the league has promoted rule changes to make the things fans (and people who play basketball) hate legal moves. But all that being said, I personally still like the today's game even if nothing over the last few years. || Everything isn’t nostalgia and it’s not all about style of play, flopping into the 30th row, crying after every play, sitting out because it’s Tuesday. 

You can’t be critical of anything without it being hate today.

Why do I have to appreciate watching the lakers with Luka LeBron and Reeves bitching and posturing 90% of the game 

There are overrated players today just like their we’re overrated players yesterday. I hear Barkley say our era wasn’t better just different but when he says something critical he’s the hating old head lol

It’s only going to get softer and more entitled the more money the game makes so maybe this will be considered the golden era 20 years from now || The current style of basketball is easily the most entertaining I've seen in my lifetime, and I'm 43. The level of talent is significantly stronger than I have seen as well. The mid to late 90s and 00s were absolutely terrible when it came to talent. As a Knicks fan, it was an embarrasment that we were a tittle contender with Charles Smith, Anthony Mason, John Starks, Doc Rivers and Hubert Davis, Derek Harper and Greg Anthony being our 3-8 players on the team. I love Jordan and think he is the GOAT, but the teams he beat were usually atrocious. 

The Kobe era was way worse. If Vince Carter wasn't disappointing and T-Mac and Yao didn't have their injury issues, maybe we'd have some depth. But aside from the Shaq/Kobe Lakers and SA, there was no other team that had talent. 

The 2010s were dominated by Lebron and GSW. Those were epic matchups, but there wasn't much other competition as SA started to wane. 

And to those whining about how everyone just shoots the 3 and looks the same, sit down. Look at the five best players in the league. They are as different as can possibly be. Look at the 4 best teams, they all play different ways. Boston plays five out. Cleveland plays creative PnRs while also adopting some GS style offense with Mobley, OKC crushes with inverted PnRs and Denver plays inside out.

It really sucks that the fan base and media are so toxic, because basketball is so much fun right now. I currently live in Europe (from NYC) and I woke up early today. Got to watch three 'all-possession' games on league pass (40 minutes you see all the action cutting out stoppages and bringing up the ball) before my wife woke up. Bos/Cle, NY/Mem and LA/LA. They were all great games. || [removed] || Gold standard in what way? The 80’s and 90’s still get talked about because of many things outside of just talent on the floor. Just because players are more skilled than ever doesn’t make your period of basketball better. I see these sentiments all he time and I say, so what? The talent is always going to get better if we can continue to train and improve ppl from a younger age. That’s just how it works. 

the 80’s and 90‘s grew the game to what is it, the tv deals were fresh, the branding changed, it impacted the game around the globe in a way that was unmatched. And as much as that style of basketball isn’t as entertaining through a modern lense it was still the pinnacle of basketball as we know it when it was happening. I don’t really care about the league being so fun and talented to watch. Yea when I was a teenager in the 2000’s it was fun for me too. That’s not enough to be a gold standard. 

I see lots of fans on the internet complain about media, complain about the jerseys, complain about the players, complain about how to watch the games. Most of the same tired discussions, glazing or meme ing every player. And I swear if feels ppl like enjoy looking at the stat lines of the players vs how they actually performed. Always fighting nostalgia and waiting for the modern game to be crowned the best. Always saying someone’s on some goat trajectory. Caring about nothing but what player is on a hot streak or some goat status, and what player you want to win a title doesn’t sound like a recipe for lasting success. You have to build something with the product on the floor. If that continues to be downgraded in the eyes of the fans, I’m not sure what gold standard you think this period should be held to. || I sure hope not.  

Don't get me wrong, a lot of crazy, legendary stuff has happened,  but I'm tired of the 3 ball.

I'm truly thankful for people like Ant that just want to get out there, have that dog mentality wanting to put someone on a poster. || “If you actually think through the reason why defense is not as notable it’s because todays players are just unguardable”

Why would they be unguardable? And why would the league need to remove defensive restrictions if these players are “unguardable”

“He isn’t guarding Curry or Durant”

What? MJ is faster, bigger and stronger than Curry in every sense. What is this nonsense? || Even recently retired or currently players say this era is lacking. So you can blame it on the old heads on these Legacy media networks. However, nearly every YouTube channel that covers the league talks about how redundant today's game is. It sucks. Period. This is why ratings are tanking badly. || I’m under 40 and I don’t think it’s nostalgia. The past players played much better and it was a better product back then. || I'm hoping that the nba starts enforcing dribbling violations and travels and completey eliminates flopping and FT baiting, and actually gives the defense a fair chance again

I hope this era is actually looked at as the dark ages || Yes obviously. People are always nostalgic and wear rose colored glasses. 80s/90s NBA was great in its own way. A ton of hall of fame talent, some great dynasties, brought the game to international recognition.

It also was extremely low scoring and much more plodding and physical. Much slower paced. Athleticism really shines today in a way it didn’t back then. || As one of those in the 40-60 age bracket, I completely agree about the nostalgia-on-steroids nature of the discourse.

That said, what a lot of people who criticize the ""lack of defense"" fail to take into account is that modern defenses have to cover almost all of the 47x50 space in the halfcourt because of how dramatically shooting has improved in the pace-and-space era. || Over 40 and do think the game is better than it was but it could be even better, so hopefully this era won’t be the gold standard. 

Three things to improve for me are:

Allow for just a bit more physical play by defenders.

Don’t allow offensive players to camp out in the corners, have some sort of time that there, like 5 second rule that just can’t be bypassed by moving feet in and out.

Be a tad strict with ball handling. Carrying has gone too far and if it’s atrocious and provides an advantage, it should be called. || It won't be the same because those nostalgic people you mentioned loved their era and always talk positive about it.

When this era's people are 40-60 and in charge of the media it's going to reflect this negative social media driven sports world we're in.

What are the odds this: yeah LeBron scored 38, had 12 boards and 10 dimes but come on, he missed that 4th quarter FT and that shot with 25 seconds left. He ain't clutch, no wonder they lost, world we live in will change to: Actually, upon reflection we really didn't understand how great LeBron was. We realize that now and should have appreciated him more while he was playing. 

That's the difference. That past generation elevates everyone and everything about their era. Right now everyone tears down LeBron for clicks, has their hot takes about what KD isn't instead of what he is, blasts players for load management, whose overrated, whose a bum cause they don't have a ring etc. etc.

I'm skeptical that younger people in media, growing their career in this environment, rising through the ranks because of this environment are going to later in life turn around and go, Oh man, back in the day basketball was just so awesome!

I'd be happy if that we're to happen but I'm not holding my breath || players aren’t more unguardable now because they’re better it’s because travel, carry, double dribble, and moving screen calls are extremely lax and fouls are called way easier. the average player can do way more than before but also the rules dictate the way players play and they’re coached. game was slower in the 90s because of illegal defense rules then afterwards the game got more lax as time goes on. i think you drop the best guys from any era in today’s game and they’ll play great there’s no “gold standard” just different eras || 1980-2010 was great.  2020 to current is the most garbage period of NBA basketball in my lifetime - the old heads absolutely have a valid reason for their criticism of the current game.  

Luka and SGA are the only true elite talents in the NBA right now and that feels like a problem for the league.  Cant think of an era that had worse duo from a marketability perspective. || If you put Michael Jordan in today's league he'd be Lu Dort on defense, SGA on offense. Jordan absolutely would have held Luka to 2 points in a half. || The game keeps changing and I sometimes have nostalgia for the old days, but then I go and watch the Kobe 81 point game and I can't believe the style of basketball that was happening. I watched that game so many times when I was younger and the individual skill is awesome but the team play was terrible. Everything is being optimized now, the players at every position are all becoming more skillful every year. The plays called by coaches always seem to have second side actions and decoys that allow players to make reads, and the players actually can make these reads. Almost every pass now is some version of a look off or no look. Therefore the difference between the best and worst player on the court isn't as noticeable as it was years ago because of skill and scheme. I think basketball right now might be better than it ever has been. 

So maybe the media will miss the greatness of Steph and LeBron, but let's not forget that Festus Ezeli was probably the reason why the 2016 championship swung towards Cleveland. This type of player wouldn't play crunch time now. The players are getting better and the coaches are smarter. || I don’t think it will be. While enjoyable, there’s  a lot still left to be desired.  The constant criticism by the media is grating. However lost in that criticism are some truths.  What’s happen is that the discourse on both sides have become so argumentative that neither side will hear the other one out. 

Defense for a bit was horrible. The league heard it and adjusted. The foul baiting had gotten out of hand but it has somewhat been curtailed.  The league has even tried to get the rest days of players under control. So there are some things that former players and the media sounded off about that obviously needed attention. The problem is that it’s still not enough. However the way the message is being relayed is obnoxious.  And honestly the generation of players are somewhat sensitive. 

If both sides can see that the there is a middle ground then it can be a gold standard. But both sides have to recognize that neither is 100 percent correct.  I think From about 2010-2018 was the sweet spot for the NBA.  Afterward things started shifting too far. || The problem is that in the Steph Curry era  casual watchers, or even passionate fans, can't really parse the complex motion that happens before the shot is taken. How you get a man open to get an easy layup or an open three point shot is the entire game. It's not the shot, it's what happens before the shot. There are too many moving pieces too fast for the fans to understand the tactics.

https://youtu.be/fp4but75EjY?si=8flgPsEb0yG-d4EN

In the 90's/00's era, the whole game was to get the ball to the big guy in the post or run screens to get Jordan to drive or take a mid range. It was easier to follow. But if you're telling me it was more fun watching Shaq pound defenders in the post than watching Steph's artistry, you don't know ball. || Current basketball style is boring as hell, jacking off threes from nearly half court, an abomination called as step back three (glorified travel) none of these are helping gold standart discourse || [removed] || [removed] || [removed] || [removed]",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.038,0.894,0.068,0.7405,0.08,0.735,0.185,0.9999

Will they make a deep run?,"I've been posting analytics (some of you hate them, but look at how accurate they turned out to be) and other facts here that suggested the Warriors would get 6th soon (check my posts). I missed by a couple of days because of Grimes playing the fakest game of his life. 

Warriors last 10 (8-2)

120.9 OffRtg (3rd; ≈2nd on the season)
107.4 DefRtg (3rd; ≈2nd on the season)
13.5 NetRtg (3rd; ≈1st on the season)

Steph (4) & Jimmy (8) both T10 NetRtg (mins≥28 & usg≥20%). Only CLE has more than 1 T10 Net guy.

Steph: 29.5/4/7 on 51/42/88 splits & 69 TS%. 

Steph only trails Jokic & Shai on offense (per DunksAndThrees). He's also 7th in the league in overall impact (per DunksAndThrees). He's basically 37 years old. No other player in the Top 10 in impact is over 30 (Giannis is 30).

The Warriors are elite again and Steph is quietly having an MVP esque second half to the season at age 37. He also has the most 50 point games after 30. As things progress, we're seeing that Steph has unprecedented longevity. Especially for a small guard. His all-time rankings will continue to climb if he keeps this up.

Warriors are currently ranked 4th on DunksAndThrees, behind OKC, CLE, and BOS. They also have a whopping 17 games with a 55%+ win probability (per DunksAndThrees). Their schedule strength up to this point has been one of the toughest in the league. Their remaining schedule strength is much weaker. The combination of adding Jimmy and facing weaker competition strongly suggests they are likely to hold onto 6th and have a small chance of climbing to 5th.

They're 2-1 vs OKC, 2-1 vs MEM, 2-1 vs HOU, and 3-1 vs MIN. Before Jimmy. Seems that if they avoid potentially tougher matchups like the Lakers and Denver, they could make a big run in the Western Conference and maybe end up in the NBA Finals. Would they then face Boston? With not one, but TWO Celtics Killers in Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler?

Intriguing!",177,122,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j38tqg/warriors_82_in_their_last_10_games_will_they_make/,2025-03-04 06:37:19,"Lol I am really excited as a warriors fan. However, we still have some glaring holes in our game, and don't really have a clear 3rd scoring option without Kuminga. Quinten Post is getting there as a reliable spacer, so him Jimmy and JK will feast. I hope JK can focus more on 1v1 defense, cause our perimeter defense can do better honestly. || There’s an unlikely reality they end up on the opposite side of the bracket to Nuggets/Lakers and if they’re very lucky OKC too

In that case, I could definitely see it. If they have to go through all 3 of those teams (likeliest outcome if they finish 6 or 7), I’d very seriously doubt it  || In my opinion, we get trashed by OKC, Lakers... and we can compete decently with wolves, nuggets, grizzlies, rockets and clippers. Specifically with the nuggets we can't stop Joker but we can lock down everyone else and make Joker beat us himself. || I think one important thing to mention is that Jimmy does have an injury history, having missed the playoffs last year due to getting injured. Part of that is obviously due to his age. But another part of that is his style of play does usually result in a lot of contact, unlike Steph. 

You can say there is a lot less pressure on him to carry, then there was with the Heat. But even if he somehow makes the finals, I feel like he’d be pretty battered up by the bloodbath that is the West and not really able to perform. That’s what happened 2 years ago in the East, having to go 7 games against the Celtics. Whereas rn the East has two super teams that will have an intense series but otherwise be fresh for the Finals. || They schedule have consisted of bad teams, Milwaukee and Houston being the good teams they faced, and Bucks didn’t have Giannis and Rockets are trending down. Their record right now those mean much, I’d expect them to be 6-4 or 7-3 without Butler anyway, and the Orlando game was Steph being Steph, nothing to do with Butler arriving.

I do like what I’m seeing from them, specially how Steph is rejuvenated not being triple teamed and having more space to operate. They are winning because the offense overpowers teams. However, their offense still lacks shooters, their offensive rebounding could be better. If they have shooters out there, the defense sucks and forces Dray and Jimmy to over rotate. If they add good defenders than there’s just two shooters out there. I think their holes are clearer and mor exploitable than the other top5 teams. I’m putting them in the Bucks tier now, maybe Knicks. || I would never count out Steph or Jimmy butler in the playoffs. It would be crazy but no one thought Jimmy could take a playin team to the finals or that Steph would win with the 2022 team. || It really depends who they get in the first round. If they get 6th, and Denver/LA decide to ease off the gas to let Memphis/Houston face them in the first round, I can see GSW win that series. 

If GSW end up facing Denver or OKC in the first round, I can't see them winning that I'm afraid. 

If it's the Lakers, oh boy give me LeBron v Steph one more time. I do think GSW could win that but it can go either way. || [removed] || Imo they don't need ""too"" many things to go their way for them to make another deep run. They are older now so health will be the number one concern, but if Draymond, Butler, Steph can all stay healthy they will be able to beat any team in a series. Especially if Steph decides he wants to go nuclear, which is a possibility at anytime even at his age. Butler's smart game really complements Steph quite well and Steph can be good with anyone with his elite off ball movement.

Exciting time to be an NBA fan as it's far more than a 2 horse race for the championship. || Not like they have played good teams and when they have their stars have sat. 

Everyone was calling their run after all star break. Don’t they have the weakest schedule? || They played terrible teams in the last 10 lol.

They don’t have one win in that stretch where they weren’t massive favourites. || They have a long battle ahead and the most important thing for them is making sure they have Jimmy and Steph healthy come playoff time. If either one is not at full strength the Warriors are getting cooked by any playoff caliber team, so I would say they are more Cinderella’s ugly sister then a Cinderella || I am worried about the point of attack defence and general shot blocking/rim protecting. Draymond has always been a unique rim protector because he didn’t actually block shots and if the team is big/ athletic then he actually protection at the rim can be exposed but he is a great paint protector he plugs up holes and players don’t even get to the rim. But against the elite teams who have strong rim attacking and finishing I do think it can be a real issue. So draymond offers a supremely unique rim protection but I think there is considerable value of actual shot blocking that he doesn’t offer especially in 2025. I’m interested though. || I think them facing OKC would actually be one of their best bets.

I feel they're a sleeper pick for sure. regardless of what seed they get they have too much playoff experience. Lowkey Klay would be great - despite his meh play, he was an insane threat and quintessential to the 2022 ring || Warriors are dangerous. Draymond is a nightmare to deal with defensively and against someone like Chet, Dray very well could bully him. They have a lot of depth defensively too and of course the loaded front court of Steph curry and break out future all star Podz getting to their spots and Jimmy connecting with the team makes them a tough contender. || It would be nice, but they can’t survive the non-Steph and Jimmy minutes to save a life || [removed] || [removed] || They need to get to 4th or 5th seed. I don’t see them beating any of the top 3. || I hope so but they are so small and limited. If Steph isn’t on, I just have no idea how they make up the scoring. Sure, Jimmy is good to great but they hardly have scoring outside of these two. If Hield goes on a heater they could be a surprise, but they just look tiny out there and very limited offensively. 

I think they can out hustle people, unless they play Rockets or Thunder. If they can match up against a Clippers team or Memphis team I think they’d win the series. They’d probably hold their own against the Rockets, but it would be brutal given how hard the Rockets play. I’d be shocked if they could beat one of Lakers, OKC, Denver right now. Denver doesn’t seem that much better but they would abuse GS in the paint and it would just be so much easier for them to control the game. 

Again, I hope they make a run. However, they have a huge hill to climb. || I would love that but tbh I don’t see them beating OKC or Lakers. Maybe nuggets, but not Lakers or OKC for sure. 

Yea I’m aware they’ve won already but I mean in playoffs || It's going to be tough because the competition is stiff, but you can never count out Steph. Even though he's a step slower, he can night night any game if he's feeling it and has enough support (screeners and playmakers like Jimmy Buckets to draw some attention). 

Draymond is still somewhat surprisingly effective at what he does and Podziemski's obviously playing well. They have shooting off the bench in Hield and defense in GP2. 

My thing is I don't think they have enough depth. They're like 2 pieces short, especially against teams like the Thunder and Lakers. But can they make it to the WCF and beyond? It's def possible. Playoff Jimmy is a real thing and he never had anyone like Steph || The one thing that makes it hard to evaluate the Warriors is that this core clearly has an X-factor.  They know what it takes to win it all, better than anyone else in the league.  It’s tough to rattle that resolve if you’re an opponent with a theoretical upper-hand || GSW is interesting. They have all the talent they need in the wing and point guard. The problem is they don’t have a consistent big man who can hold his own and not get pushed around in the paint. || They have 3 stars who raise their games in the playoffs and a good coach. As long as they are healthy I expect them to make the WCF. || I think they end up 6th and I think they play the Lakers in the first round and I’m calling an upset. Warriors then play the T wolves who upset the 2 seed Nuggets in the second round and win in 7. Warriors then play a tough series but lose in 5 to the Thunder.  

So yes I see them making a run || Kuminga should be back before the end of the regular season right? || Fifth seed minimum is likely at the current pace. Rockets may not fall enough, but Memphis likely will with JJJ out and a brutal schedule ahead. Not going to say it's a guarantee, but I wouldn't say it's unlikely at all. || We are less than 20 games away and the seedinh looks relatively clear


Okc locked at 1st


Den/lakers 2nd/3rd with a cushion over mem/hou 4th/5th seeds


Gsw and minny with a 3~ losses gap below at 6/7 seeds


Clippers/sac with a small gap below at 8th/9th


Is possible that teams move out of these areas, maybe warriors continud on a war path and overcome the 4th/5th seeds for example but with only 20 games left margins are pretty tight for any of these teams to lose their 2/3 game cushions so dont expect many of them to end out of where they are now


The most likely bracket is okc vs clippers/kings against winner of memphis/rockets


Lakers/denver vs minnesota/clippers in the other side of the bracket || I think the Lakers matchup is more of a tossup, now that AD is gone - he's the guy that always killed the Warriors, and the Lakers have no one that can even pretend to guard Steph or Jimmy. That would be a fun match-up.

Jokic I agree. Can't see Draymond enjoying being tasked with holding off Jokic for extended minutes.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.082,0.831,0.088,0.4857,0.093,0.735,0.172,0.9995

Steph only trails Jokic & Shai on offense (per DunksAndThrees). He's also 7th in the league in overall impact (per DunksAndThrees). He's basically 37 years old. No other player in the Top 10 in impact is over 30 (Giannis is 30).

The Warriors are elite again and Steph is quietly having an MVP esque second half to the season at age 37. He also has the most 50 point games after 30. As things progress, we're seeing that Steph has unprecedented longevity. Especially for a small guard. His all-time rankings will continue to climb if he keeps this up.

Warriors are currently ranked 4th on DunksAndThrees, behind OKC, CLE, and BOS. They also have a whopping 17 games with a 55%+ win probability (per DunksAndThrees). Their schedule strength up to this point has been one of the toughest in the league. Their remaining schedule strength is much weaker. The combination of adding Jimmy and facing weaker competition strongly suggests they are likely to hold onto 6th and have a small chance of climbing to 5th.

They're 2-1 vs OKC, 2-1 vs MEM, 2-1 vs HOU, and 3-1 vs MIN. Before Jimmy. Seems that if they avoid potentially tougher matchups like the Lakers and Denver, they could make a big run in the Western Conference and maybe end up in the NBA Finals. Would they then face Boston? With not one, but TWO Celtics Killers in Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler?

Intriguing!",174,122,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j38tqg/warriors_82_in_their_last_10_games_will_they_make/,2025-03-04 06:37:19,"Lol I am really excited as a warriors fan. However, we still have some glaring holes in our game, and don't really have a clear 3rd scoring option without Kuminga. Quinten Post is getting there as a reliable spacer, so him Jimmy and JK will feast. I hope JK can focus more on 1v1 defense, cause our perimeter defense can do better honestly. || There’s an unlikely reality they end up on the opposite side of the bracket to Nuggets/Lakers and if they’re very lucky OKC too

In that case, I could definitely see it. If they have to go through all 3 of those teams (likeliest outcome if they finish 6 or 7), I’d very seriously doubt it  || In my opinion, we get trashed by OKC, Lakers... and we can compete decently with wolves, nuggets, grizzlies, rockets and clippers. Specifically with the nuggets we can't stop Joker but we can lock down everyone else and make Joker beat us himself. || I think one important thing to mention is that Jimmy does have an injury history, having missed the playoffs last year due to getting injured. Part of that is obviously due to his age. But another part of that is his style of play does usually result in a lot of contact, unlike Steph. 

You can say there is a lot less pressure on him to carry, then there was with the Heat. But even if he somehow makes the finals, I feel like he’d be pretty battered up by the bloodbath that is the West and not really able to perform. That’s what happened 2 years ago in the East, having to go 7 games against the Celtics. Whereas rn the East has two super teams that will have an intense series but otherwise be fresh for the Finals. || They schedule have consisted of bad teams, Milwaukee and Houston being the good teams they faced, and Bucks didn’t have Giannis and Rockets are trending down. Their record right now those mean much, I’d expect them to be 6-4 or 7-3 without Butler anyway, and the Orlando game was Steph being Steph, nothing to do with Butler arriving.

I do like what I’m seeing from them, specially how Steph is rejuvenated not being triple teamed and having more space to operate. They are winning because the offense overpowers teams. However, their offense still lacks shooters, their offensive rebounding could be better. If they have shooters out there, the defense sucks and forces Dray and Jimmy to over rotate. If they add good defenders than there’s just two shooters out there. I think their holes are clearer and mor exploitable than the other top5 teams. I’m putting them in the Bucks tier now, maybe Knicks. || I would never count out Steph or Jimmy butler in the playoffs. It would be crazy but no one thought Jimmy could take a playin team to the finals or that Steph would win with the 2022 team. || It really depends who they get in the first round. If they get 6th, and Denver/LA decide to ease off the gas to let Memphis/Houston face them in the first round, I can see GSW win that series. 

If GSW end up facing Denver or OKC in the first round, I can't see them winning that I'm afraid. 

If it's the Lakers, oh boy give me LeBron v Steph one more time. I do think GSW could win that but it can go either way. || [removed] || Imo they don't need ""too"" many things to go their way for them to make another deep run. They are older now so health will be the number one concern, but if Draymond, Butler, Steph can all stay healthy they will be able to beat any team in a series. Especially if Steph decides he wants to go nuclear, which is a possibility at anytime even at his age. Butler's smart game really complements Steph quite well and Steph can be good with anyone with his elite off ball movement.

Exciting time to be an NBA fan as it's far more than a 2 horse race for the championship. || Not like they have played good teams and when they have their stars have sat. 

Everyone was calling their run after all star break. Don’t they have the weakest schedule? || They played terrible teams in the last 10 lol.

They don’t have one win in that stretch where they weren’t massive favourites. || They have a long battle ahead and the most important thing for them is making sure they have Jimmy and Steph healthy come playoff time. If either one is not at full strength the Warriors are getting cooked by any playoff caliber team, so I would say they are more Cinderella’s ugly sister then a Cinderella || I am worried about the point of attack defence and general shot blocking/rim protecting. Draymond has always been a unique rim protector because he didn’t actually block shots and if the team is big/ athletic then he actually protection at the rim can be exposed but he is a great paint protector he plugs up holes and players don’t even get to the rim. But against the elite teams who have strong rim attacking and finishing I do think it can be a real issue. So draymond offers a supremely unique rim protection but I think there is considerable value of actual shot blocking that he doesn’t offer especially in 2025. I’m interested though. || I think them facing OKC would actually be one of their best bets.

I feel they're a sleeper pick for sure. regardless of what seed they get they have too much playoff experience. Lowkey Klay would be great - despite his meh play, he was an insane threat and quintessential to the 2022 ring || Warriors are dangerous. Draymond is a nightmare to deal with defensively and against someone like Chet, Dray very well could bully him. They have a lot of depth defensively too and of course the loaded front court of Steph curry and break out future all star Podz getting to their spots and Jimmy connecting with the team makes them a tough contender. || It would be nice, but they can’t survive the non-Steph and Jimmy minutes to save a life || [removed] || [removed] || They need to get to 4th or 5th seed. I don’t see them beating any of the top 3. || I hope so but they are so small and limited. If Steph isn’t on, I just have no idea how they make up the scoring. Sure, Jimmy is good to great but they hardly have scoring outside of these two. If Hield goes on a heater they could be a surprise, but they just look tiny out there and very limited offensively. 

I think they can out hustle people, unless they play Rockets or Thunder. If they can match up against a Clippers team or Memphis team I think they’d win the series. They’d probably hold their own against the Rockets, but it would be brutal given how hard the Rockets play. I’d be shocked if they could beat one of Lakers, OKC, Denver right now. Denver doesn’t seem that much better but they would abuse GS in the paint and it would just be so much easier for them to control the game. 

Again, I hope they make a run. However, they have a huge hill to climb. || I would love that but tbh I don’t see them beating OKC or Lakers. Maybe nuggets, but not Lakers or OKC for sure. 

Yea I’m aware they’ve won already but I mean in playoffs || It's going to be tough because the competition is stiff, but you can never count out Steph. Even though he's a step slower, he can night night any game if he's feeling it and has enough support (screeners and playmakers like Jimmy Buckets to draw some attention). 

Draymond is still somewhat surprisingly effective at what he does and Podziemski's obviously playing well. They have shooting off the bench in Hield and defense in GP2. 

My thing is I don't think they have enough depth. They're like 2 pieces short, especially against teams like the Thunder and Lakers. But can they make it to the WCF and beyond? It's def possible. Playoff Jimmy is a real thing and he never had anyone like Steph || The one thing that makes it hard to evaluate the Warriors is that this core clearly has an X-factor.  They know what it takes to win it all, better than anyone else in the league.  It’s tough to rattle that resolve if you’re an opponent with a theoretical upper-hand || GSW is interesting. They have all the talent they need in the wing and point guard. The problem is they don’t have a consistent big man who can hold his own and not get pushed around in the paint. || They have 3 stars who raise their games in the playoffs and a good coach. As long as they are healthy I expect them to make the WCF. || I think they end up 6th and I think they play the Lakers in the first round and I’m calling an upset. Warriors then play the T wolves who upset the 2 seed Nuggets in the second round and win in 7. Warriors then play a tough series but lose in 5 to the Thunder.  

So yes I see them making a run || Kuminga should be back before the end of the regular season right? || Fifth seed minimum is likely at the current pace. Rockets may not fall enough, but Memphis likely will with JJJ out and a brutal schedule ahead. Not going to say it's a guarantee, but I wouldn't say it's unlikely at all. || We are less than 20 games away and the seedinh looks relatively clear


Okc locked at 1st


Den/lakers 2nd/3rd with a cushion over mem/hou 4th/5th seeds


Gsw and minny with a 3~ losses gap below at 6/7 seeds


Clippers/sac with a small gap below at 8th/9th


Is possible that teams move out of these areas, maybe warriors continud on a war path and overcome the 4th/5th seeds for example but with only 20 games left margins are pretty tight for any of these teams to lose their 2/3 game cushions so dont expect many of them to end out of where they are now


The most likely bracket is okc vs clippers/kings against winner of memphis/rockets


Lakers/denver vs minnesota/clippers in the other side of the bracket || I think the Lakers matchup is more of a tossup, now that AD is gone - he's the guy that always killed the Warriors, and the Lakers have no one that can even pretend to guard Steph or Jimmy. That would be a fun match-up.

Last night, while the Lakers and Celtics were on ABC primetime, there was another game in Golden State that was more competitive and had an intense playoff feel with frequent lead changes.

Both the Pistons and Warriors have been playing phenomenal basketball in recent weeks, steadily climbing up the standings.

#Pistons’ Current Matchup

The No. 6 seed in the East led by all star Cade Cunningham would face the No. 3 Knicks. Even with a healthy Jalen Brunson (recently injured his ankle), the Pistons could definitely upset the Knicks (already defeated New York twice at the garden).

#Warriors’ Current Matchup

The No. 6 seed in the West led by the recent member of the 25K club, Steph Curry, would face the No. 3 Lakers. Even with a healthy LeBron James (recently injured his groin), the Warriors could definitely upset the Lakers (especially after acquiring Jimmy Butler; 11-1 in the lineup).

#Avoiding No. 3

This could be the difference between advancing and elimination. The Lakers in particular may see a better matchup with the Grizzlies/Rockets than the Warriors.

The Knicks would have to go on a significant losing streak to not be the 3 seed. The Pistons may go up in seeding to the 4th or 5th seed (Knicks would be in the clear).

#Injuries

Within the last 72 hours, there have been major injuries that will affect how the rest of the season goes for these particular seeds. Nevertheless, the Warriors and Pistons are 2 teams that will not be easy matchups in Round 1 of the postseason.",281,72,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j765cg/the_current_no_6_seeds_in_both_conferences_will/,2025-03-09 07:59:47,"Warriors are much more dangerous because they e been there and have championship DNA. 

The Pistons are a tough out but they are very young. || The Pistons are young and talented, but they also have zero playoff experience. That usually results in an early exit regardless. And if a team did want to dodge the Pistons, they’d face the Pacers or Bucks, who I’d be a lot more worried about. || The Warriors have Steph and the pedigree to be taken seriously. I don't think any serious team is worried about the positions, but they've had a great year and Cade might be all-nba. || Non ""contenders"" you don't want to see in round 1:

Warriors 
Bucks 
Clippers
Suns

High ceilings low floor teams basically. Any of these teams if they are playing well can upset a round 1 matchup. || People are underrating the pistons vets, they might not be elite players but THJ, Beasley, and Tobias are all rotational players and have plenty of playoff experience || The Pistons have been playing great but lets not act like they weren't the worst team in the league last season. Making the playoffs will be a huge success for them but the Knicks are clearly a better team.   
Detroit won on Dec.8 120-111 with Sims as the starting center and KAT as a DNP. Granted on Jan 14. Piston beat the Knicks at home by 5 points, but the Knicks blew out Detroit by 30 points on Nov 1st.  
With Kat and Mitch back for a 7 game series Pistons might sneak a game but nothing more. || I personally would not be worried for OKC or CLE with those matchups in the first round. || Nobody should want to play either of those teams. The Dubs are the hottest team in the league since the Jimmy trade, despite most of their games being on the road. And they’ve done this without Kuminga, who should be coming back from an ankle any day now. And they have Steph…and playoff Jimmy. Plus Draymond will kick you in the balls. Literally. 

The Pistons are a completely different team over the last 20 games. Cade is playing at an all-NBA level, Beasley can’t seem to miss (42% on 9.2 threes per game!), and Ausar is borderline all defense. They’re young, sure, but I like their chances against the Knicks. || You clearly haven’t watched JB Bickerstaff try to run an offense in the playoffs || The ""Pistons have zero playoff experience"" is such a BS trope.  They have over 200 games of playoff experience in their rotation between Tobias Harris, Tim Hardaway, Malik Beasley, and Dennis Schroeder.  Their coaching staff is led by a HC who has led teams to the playoffs, and they have an experienced assistant staff.  Are they AS EXPERIENCED with their playmaker Cade and HC?  No, definitely not.  But this isn't some team that's going to get to the postseason and lay down because the lights are too bright.  Have you seen how Detroit plays this season?  They scrap with everyone.  They even tried to fight Steph Curry.  I mean this with all due respect, but Detroit is almost too stupid to realize they shouldn't be as competitive as they are.

I think they beat Indy in a series and give hell to NY.  Milwaukee would be tough. || I don’t think people realize how different the basketball games are in the playoffs (far higher % half court sets vs. transition)

Or account for how “caught up in the moment” players get. Especially the ones who haven’t been there before, or gone as deep

Warriors for sure can beat the rockets or grizzlies, rockets more so. I’d favor them in either matchup but nuggets or lakers would both beat gsw in 5/6

Grizzlies far deeper than gsw but many of their young players make dumb mistakes, and Ja been throwing temper tantrums when he doesn’t get calls throwing himself into dudes, which you tend not to get more of in the playoffs || The Pistons won't. It's a jbb team. He won't make adjustments and try to brute force it. || Warriors are not doing anything in the postseason. They’re too small and reliant on Steph to shoot lights out every game. || [removed] || Agreed.
Most young core never been in a competative team.

As a pistons fan, i love this team, they might win a playoff game or two, but that's all. || Also, the Warriors are much better than their record. Since adding Butler, they've looked like one of the best teams in the West. || With the Brunson injury it may be the bucks the pistons end up playing! || Suns defense is beyond awful, they are not beating a 1/2 seed.

Bucks will prob be 4th so no top team can see them in the 1st round.

Clippers with Norm can be a tough out.

Warriors if they play Hoston/Memphis sure, the other top teams should beat them. || Suns aren’t getting out of the playin || You saying that actually convinced me less than before I read this. If you’re relying on the veteran leadership of THJ Beasley and Tobias, you aren’t doing shit. What have those 3 ever done in the playoffs. || Nov 1st pistons were a VERY different team, guys made jumps, Schroeder and Ausar changed a lot for this team || Agree that that trope is often trotted out more than it needs to be, as a Thunder fan I know that for sure. But I suppose one could argue that the lack of playoff experience together could be a little bit of a factor. Given the choice between those guys having independent playoff experience or playoff experience as a unit, you’d definitely take the latter. But I suppose the bit that’s up for debate is whether the benefit would be massive or negligible. I suppose it’s not really a question that can be answered as only one outcome can come true, but it’s something to think about. 

Then again, the unit has looked good this regular season, so maybe that translates to the playoffs. I just wonder if it’s going to be a bit of a roadblock for these guys who don’t know what effect, say, getting clamped by the same team for the first two games might have on their teammate and whether they can trust them to bounce back in the following games. 

I don’t know, I’m yapping about hypotheticals so I probably sound like a crackpot, but maybe you can see what I’m getting at. || As a Cavs fan who watched a JB team the past few years, he's definitely good at laying foundation for good culture and raising a teams potential floor.

I think if they can get the right seeding, they can win a 1st round against the likes of Memphis/Houston/Sacramento. All depends on the matchup. || How many times have I heard that now? || Remindme!

Stephen Curry,"""Stephen Curry"" OR ""Chef Curry"" OR ""Steph"" OR ""Curry"" OR ""Stephen""",2025-03-08,nbadiscussion,1j6wkrc,Debunking the Phil Jackson rule once and for all,"Now that every team has played their 60th game, it's that time of year when everyone is talking about the Phil Jackson '40 before 20' rule - that is, to be a championship contender, you have to win your 40th game before you lose your 20th. According to this rule, the only three teams that can win it all this year are the Thunder, Cavs and Celtics. But exactly how useful is it?

# The timeframe is arbitrary.

Everyone always adds the 'since 1980' caveat, which Phil never said. But why is that? Could it be that the 1979, 1978 and 1977 champs all failed to qualify? No, it has to be the addition of the 3pt line, despite the fact that the 1980 finalist Lakers and Sixers made one 3pter *combined* across the entire six-game series. The NBA of 1995 (the first 'exception') is far closer, both stylistically and chronologically, to the late seventies than it is to today - and Phil should know: those were his playing days. But it was also the golden age of parity, post the 1976 ABA merger (which makes far more sense if we're going to draw an arbitrary dividing line). With all the talk about the parity of today, why exclude those champion Blazers, Bullets and Sonics?

\[This alone should be enough to discredit the rule, but I'll humour the Phil apologists (Philologists?) and only talk about the 3pt era from here\]

# Are early wins inherently more valuable?

This is the first key plank of the argument - that banking wins earlier in the season allows teams to rest up and prepare for the playoffs later. In fairness, there's [some](https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/news/as-dnp-rests-rise-remember-momentum-is-a-myth/348273/) [evidence](https://www.theringer.com/2019/04/12/nba/nba-playoff-momentum) for this. But is winning two-thirds of your first 60 games really better than winning two-thirds of your games full stop? That works out to a 55-win pace. But none of the four famed 'exceptions' to the rule (1995 Rockets, 2004 Pistons, 2006 Heat, 2021 Bucks) reached that threshold either, so that doesn't really help us. We'll have to widen the net.

\[Bucks had a shortened season but were on pace to miss. Henceforth I'm excluding both COVID and lockout years\]

# Everyone measures this the wrong way.

Any previous analyses I've seen along these lines have been only skin-deep: 'A high percentage of NBA champions meet this criterion; therefore it's a good one.' Wrong. I could just as easily create a u/teh_noob_ rule which says, 'You have to win 52+ games to be a champ.' That would cover all winners except the Rockets, but it would also massively increase the rate of false positives.

\[Hell, lower it to 47 games if you want to hit 100 per cent\]

Nobody ever looks at the other side of the coin - that is, 'How likely are Phil Jackson contenders to win?' You know why? It's more difficult, and people are lazy. But here you have it: 175 teams have met that threshold over the relevant timespan, a little over four per year. With 38 champs, that's a success rate of just over 20 per cent. Pretty good, right? Well, going back to our previous point, there have been 179 teams who won 55 games over the same period. The fractionally lower hit rate is statistically insignificant.

# Can we fix it?

Now we've established that the 'early wins' part of it doesn't really matter, does 55 games strike the right balance between breadth and depth of contenders? Well, no team has won exactly 55 games and gone on to win the title, so we can safely bump it to 56, knocking off a bunch of pretenders without losing any real contenders and increasing your winning odds to about 25 per cent. But in fact only one team won at the 56-game mark, Phil's own 2001 Lakers - an all-time masterclass in taking the regular season off. It would be no great loss to write them off as another exception and raise the bar to 57 wins.

Where does it end? Obviously the more wins you have, the higher your title odds. At 63-64 wins you cross the line of 'more likely to win than not'. That's not mere contenders; those are title favourites. About three teams win 57 games per year. That's a contender for me. Your mileage may vary.

\[Amusingly, you're only 50% likely to win the title with 70+ wins\]

# Case studies

I omitted to mention earlier that there are two teams who met 40-20 and failed to reach 55 wins yet still won the title, and they both happened quite recently: the 2022 Warriors and 2023 Nuggets. The Warriors are easily explained. They won 70% of their games with Steph in the lineup (and even higher with Dray). Only injuries determined which combination of 40/20, 55+ and champion they would meet. The Nuggets are a bit more in the spirit of the rule, coasting and resting down the stretch (which cost Jokic MVP). But as has been well publicised, they didn't face any 50-win teams in the playoffs, let alone 55+ or 40/20.

\[But kudos to Phil for the out-of-sample predictions\]

# Conclusion

Fear not, fans of the Lakers/Knicks/Grizz. You may have narrowly missed Phil's seal of approval, but if you win 55-57 games, you're still in it with a chance.

\[Hell, even Bucks and Rockets are mathematically possible\]

# Further research

The extended hypothesis would be whether speed of reaching 40 wins is a better predictor of playoff success than overall record amongst teams who both hit that mark, or to find out who did better out of non-champion teams that reached one of 40/20 or 55+ but not the other.

\[With nearly 50 such teams, this was beyond my scope\]",307,104,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j6wkrc/debunking_the_phil_jackson_rule_once_and_for_all/,2025-03-08 20:36:43,"Ultimately, Phil was probably just trying to stress the importance of the regular season.

It doesn’t make sense to count teams that hit 40-20 and fail to win a chip against the Jackson rule when a 40-20 team wins the chip that same season.  

If anything the best analysis would be to look at either the record of who beats 40-20 teams, or likelihood of reaching the conference finals. || I don’t think it’s arbitrary.

Whereas a team that reaches the threshold later in the season can be one that recently got a good piece. However, this “newer” team is untested in the playoffs.

The 2021 Bucks were the after Covid season so it was a weird seasons with players missing games due protocols.

And the 2006 Heat actually went on a 10 game winning streak after losing the 20th game so they were 40-20.

I would say the rule has been very good so far. || I appreciate your effort, but I really hate this analysis.  The Phil Jackson rule is a guideline.  A rule of thumb for us to have an idea of ""who is most likely to \*contend\* for the title"", generally meaning Conference Finalists, Finalists, and probable titlists.  It is not intended to be a predictor of ""who is going to win the title this year, for sure"".  If there was a guideline that could predict that with 100% accuracy, we'd all be billionaires.

But your analysis is essentially a statistical exercise in widening the criteria such that we include enough to cover all the titlists and making the Phil Jackson rule pointless.  I mean, could we say, ""All NBA titlists win games""?  Yes, but the fact that this is true doesn't make the 40-20 guideline less useful.  The calculation you make of percentage of 40-20 teams that win vs. 55 win teams is misleading in my opinion.  You should be comparing 40-20 teams to non-40-20 teams that win.  I think then we'd all see the statistical weight of being 40-20.  And if your eventual point is ""40-20 is useless because it's essentially the same chance to win as 55+ teams"" - that may be true, but with the 40-20 guideline, we have an idea of who to really keep an eye on a full 1.5-2 months earlier!  So why would I have to wait until the season's final day to figure out who's a power player when another guideline does essentially the same thing months beforehand?

Look, we have a number of indicators that determine a true \*likely\* title contender - 40 before 20, apparently 55+ game winners, top 3 seeds - they're all equally as useful in my opinion.  Are there exceptions to these rules?  Yes, absolutely.  But exceptions don't prove a guideline to be useless imo.  You can look at my post history, I'm a person who constantly bangs the drum about non-top 3 seeds having vanishingly small chances to win a title, but will a non-top 3, non-defending-champ eventually win a title?  Sure!  It may even be a team that went 34-26 in their first 60, and only won 46 games.  Does that mean I throw all our guidelines out the window and say ""Oh well!  Time for a new way to 100% determine the champ?""  No, you go forward, understanding that you have to play the games to determine the winner, and that's why we watch ball.  Again, appreciate the effort and upvoted the post. || Regarding the Warriors and Nuggets examples:

These are also both Western Conference teams. What we forget is that the West has historically been the more competitive conference for the majority of the NBA. We know that teams in the same conference play against each other much more in the regular season than the opposing conference. 

This means that top tier East teams do have somewhat inflated numbers when it comes to regular season wins. I think there should be a metric for evaluating this differential and it should be commonly applied on a season-by-season basis. || I mean he was really trying to stress the importance of starting the regular season off strong and with the right habits, like a champion would. 

You can debunk his idea of contenders winning 40 before losing 20 by acknowledging the existence of the 2014-15 Atlanta Hawks though.  || You're far more than 50% likely to win the title at 70 wins. Just because only two teams have hit 70 wins and only one got it done, doesn't mean that that's the probability of 70 win teams to win the title. || Two teams make the finals every year though, the rule is to be a contender, yet you say it’s only a 20% success rate, that’s unreasonable. The rule isn’t “you’ll be a champion” it’s “you’ll be a contender” 

Realistically the 4 conference finalists could all be counted, which would make the Jackson rule far more accurate. || I mean, I always saw it as more of a guideline than a hard and fast rule. It’s more like saying “the large majority of champions win at least 2/3rds of their regular season games” which is pretty close to the truth. || My theory has always been that if you rank top 10 within both offensive & defensive rating then you are a title contender. || I see y’all are still overthinking this. It’s just a simple heuristic. It’s not written in stone. || I think you misunderstand the point of this exercise. The ""Phil Jackson Rule"" exists to evaluate potential NBA finals contenders, while the season is still in progress. 

Yes, a team's final record will likely be a better indicator of their championship potential than a ~60ish game sample, it will include a more complete data set. I don't think Phil, or anyone else would dispute that.

Basically, the rule is simplifying these two statements:

- NBA Teams that win 67%+ of their games are finals contenders
- 60 games is a valid sample size to draw conclusions about a teams true quality.



Winning 55 games is a 67% win percentage also... || I always thought this made sense in the 90s and 00s when there were some really bad teams in the NBA, so good teams should be beating up on them. But in today's NBA, even a bad team like the Hornets still have a great player and other playmakers. Bad teams today can still be at good teams on random nights because there's just so much more talent in the NBA today. So good teams just aren't getting to that 40-20 thing as easily any more, but doesn't mean they aren't championship material || The fact that your first piece of evidence is to add in results from 45 years ago does the opposite of what you're attempting. People lead with their best evidence, because frankly people aren't going to read 5 paragraphs of nonsense to get to the real stuff. 

The premise isn't meant to be absolutely perfect, it's more a guide. And how many teams won without that qualifier? That's the real test. 

Might I also suggest that instead of mere blocks of text, when you're talking stats, use table and different methods of presenting information. It's just hard to read anything when it's so homogeneous. || lol. Let me guess? You’re a lakers fan? It’s all good man.

Its picked up much more steam and airspace than it should have. Obviously if you have a 67% win pct at minimum with 22 games remaining you are a good team. The eventual champion coming from this group shouldn't be anymore surprising than OP's 52+. All of these are arbitrary. The post itself has no meaningful analysis. || Are you including the 95 Rockets? That was a strike season which is another variable || Whether record or seed, what you and others are missing is that this is a correlation vs causation problem. Which statement makes more sense: “great teams win championships” or “top seeds win championships”?

Being a great team leads to having a great record and being a 1 seed. Great teams are very likely to win championships. If you put the Hawks or Pacers or Sixers as the 1 seed in the East this year and slid everyone else back, they would be marginally more likely to win a championship, but they would still not be close to the favorites. 

More simply put, being a great team is the cause, having a great record or seed is just highly correlated with being a great team. || Good teams win games, the argument is simple as that. || Ultimately Phil said a lot of things that were wrong, like that corner 3's lead to fast breaks and are a bad shot || It's true 91 percent of the time! Do you have a mid-season rule that is 95 or 100 percent correct to replace it? The **40–20 rule** posits that an [NBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA) team must win 40 games before losing 20 to have a chance at winning that year's [championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals). It was first publicized by coach [Phil Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson) in 2008. Ever since the NBA added the three-point line in the 1979-80 season, 41 out of 45 NBA champions have abided by the 40-20 rule; the four exceptions were the [1994–95 Houston Rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994%E2%80%9395_Houston_Rockets), [2003–04 Detroit Pistons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_Detroit_Pistons), [2005–06 Miami Heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_Miami_Heat), and the [2020–21 Milwaukee Bucks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_Milwaukee_Bucks). || People take this stat the wrong way. 40-20 isn’t about predicting who’s going to win it all. It’s more about teams that can’t hit that mark not being a realistic contender.

Stephen Curry,"""Stephen Curry"" OR ""Chef Curry"" OR ""Steph"" OR ""Curry"" OR ""Stephen""",2025-03-10,nbadiscussion,1j8tpx7,Dissecting the Lakers' defense,"If you have watched any NFL whatsoever over the last two decades, you have undoubtedly heard someone comment that former Patriots coach Bill Belichick always tried to “take away what an opponent does best.” I know I shouldn’t bring up a Boston team when discussing the Los Angeles Lakers, but coach JJ Redick has instilled something similar in his team this season. Sound tactics, buy-in from players, and a healthy dash of luck have cooked up something tasty in Hollywood.

They utilize all the buzzword-laden modern defensive principles: peel and scram switching, targeted help, free-safety play, tactical ball pressure, one-man zone principles, and multiple defensive looks to keep opponents guessing where and when the help will come from. The Belichickian end goal: the Lakers want to make opponents’ worst players beat them. It’s worked. Since January 15th, the [Lakers have had the best defense in the league](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=01/15/2025&end=10/15/2025).

\[As always when I do these breakdowns, I've included plenty of illustrative video clips. You can find them[ in-context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked) or linked in the post.\]

To paint a picture with video instead of words, check recent victories over the Clippers. First, watch how the team treats James Harden with the ball: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

Then, watch how they insult poor Kris Dunn when he has the rock: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

That’s cruel!

A higher-profile example came in LA’s much-ballyhooed victory over Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets, when the Lakers limited the big man to a paltry seven field goal attempts while enticing Russell Westbrook into leading the charge with 17.

The Nuggets game was instructive. Most teams in the league are comfortable helping off of non-threats, but rarely to LA’s degree. Watch this play: \[[video here\]](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)

When the ball inevitably finds Aaron Gordon wide-open beyond the arc, no Laker so much as stunts at the forward. Sure, Gordon drains it, but the Lakers have had far more success than failure with this strategy — teams have made [just 33% of their flings from deep](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/shots?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=01/15/2025&end=10/15/2025#tab-defense_shooting_accuracy) against LA since January 15^(th), second-lowest in the league.

Plenty of good fortune is involved in that number. The Lakers don’t have a magic voodoo doll they prick every time someone enters their shooting motion (probably). They steer the best looks toward weaker shooters, hoping to siphon the ball away from a team’s more efficient scorers, but that effect is likely overstated.

The stars have to play along, too. The Lakers held Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to just 33 combined points in LA’s victory over Boston in January; the Jays were *determined* not to let that happen in Round 2, as they were the only Celtics with double-digit shots in Boston’s victory this past weekend.

But the approach has generally worked. Karl-Anthony Towns: 3-of-13 shooting, 12 points. James Harden: 18-for-67 over four games. Steph Curry: 37 points, but on 35 tries (including 20 triples!). Anfernee Simons: 3-of-13 shooting, eight points. Anthony Edwards: 6-for-12, etc. etc.

A byproduct of this help-heavy scheme is that the Lakers give up a lot of threes — they’ve allowed opponents to shoot a greater-than-median share of three-pointers [22 times in their 26 games since January 15th.](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/14/gamelogs#tab-shooting_defense_freq) Defenses can only control so much once the ball takes flight, but the Lakers have enforced their will to the best of their ability.

Walling off stars’ driving lanes to allow more threes isn’t the only pitch; Redick has done a nice job tailoring his solutions to the opponent to take away strengths. In both games against Boston, for example, Redick has instructed the team’s defense to stick tighter to the Celtics’ bevy of shooters — Boston actually shot a *smaller* share of threes against the Lakers than their league-leading average in both recent games.

A more minor (but still important) note: Los Angeles has also dramatically improved its transition defense during this stretch. They were [dead last in transition defense](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/context?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=10/15/2024&end=01/14/2025#tab-defense_transition) on January 14th; since then, they’ve been 11th-best, the difference of roughly a layup per game.

Like all defenses, there are still areas of concern. Speedy guards have given LA problems, as Jalen Brunson, Tyrese Maxey, and Kyrie Irving have had success probing through the Lakers’ big, but relatively slow, defenders — when Jarred Vanderbilt isn’t on the court, waterbugs can flit around without much resistance.

Truthfully, though, that would be a bigger problem in the East than in the West. Los Angeles’ uniquely giant lineups are better equipped to handle their conference’s brightest lights. Even without a dominant center, the team can field a forest: LeBron James, Hayes, Dorian Finney-Smith, Vanderbilt, and Hachimura all have at least a little experience playing center. Add Doncic, and you have a truly Brobdingnagian core.

Size isn’t particularly advantageous unless the team puts in the effort. Redick pointed this out recently when he acknowledged that “there’s actually only one cheat code in the NBA, and that's playing hard.”

He’s right. Remember, we’re not far from the Lakers looking like *this*: \[[video hereo](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

Now, even Luka Doncic and The Ancient One are flying around like their pants have been sipping Red Bull.

Notably, Doncic’s [three best games by Defensive EPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/player/1629029/historical) have come as a Laker. Doncic is usually stationed on a non-threat, so Redick has encouraged him to play highwayman (as long as he doesn’t compromise the defensive shell too much): \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

James’ defense has similarly upgraded. Redick claims that LeBron is performing at an All-Defense level. I can’t go that far, as he’s still a little prone to ball-watching and picking his spots… but he sure is picking a lot *more* spots than he used to. Players are legitimately frightened of James, for good reason — he’s only faced 26 isos *all season,* giving up just 11 points!

But I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the defensive turnaround started around when the team traded for DFS and intensified with Vanderbilt’s return from injury in late January.

The DFS fit has been flawless. The Lakers have allowed [\-8.4 points per 100 possessions fewer](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/1134/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) when he’s on the floor, in the 96th percentile, and he has guarded nearly everyone for LA. [His top matchups](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627827/head-to-head) include every notable offensive name from Jokic to Tatum to Curry. He’s a try-hard who sets the tone for the Lakers. I’m particularly fond of his pell-mell close-outs: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

If Finney-Smith is a try-hard, Vanderbilt is the try-hardest. Every game, the man leaves skin on the floor laying out for loose balls: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

Vanderbilt’s brand of defensive freneticism — all waving hands, skittery feet, and heedless dives — has always freaked out opposing ballhandlers. Offensive limitations curtail his playing time, but that may be a blessing in disguise, as it allows Vanderbilt to consistently red-line his motor without blowing it out.

The rest of the crew has done their part, too. Thrust into a larger role by necessity, Hayes has been playing better than at any point in his career. Gabe Vincent and Jordan Goodwin are *dawged* on-ball defenders, and Redick has not been afraid to let them try their hands at switching onto centers despite their pint-guard size (see what I did there?). While rookie Dalton Knecht has struggled at times this season, he’s figured out how to mitigate his weakness within the scheme — and when he forgets, Redick has had no problem letting him learn from the pine.

With Doncic playing at least passably, and sometimes better than that, the team’s main defensive weak link has been Austin Reaves. While Reaves tries, he’s often caught too upright in his stance, losing the leverage to hold his ground. Bigger foes run through him like he’s break tape, and even similarly-sized opponents smash him with quick seals in the post: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

Smart help can mitigate this a bit. Look at this perfectly executed scram switch, in which Vanderbilt sprints over to replace Reaves as soon as the pass is in the air: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

Although Reaves isn’t good on defense, the Lakers are in pretty solid shape if he’s their fifth-worst defender at any given time. Frankly, it might be a positive for the Lakers to provide an alternative target to Doncic. Attacking the superstar can tire Doncic out or get him in foul trouble (something he’s struggled with at times).

Overall, this isn’t a top-one defense over a full season. The defensive shooting luck is real, and they’ve had a relatively easy schedule during this stretch. But nobody plays only cupcakes during a 26-game run. The Lakers have shown that they can sustain a high level of play with smart tactics and high effort.

However, without elite rim protection, the team’s margin for error is small. It shrank further with LeBron James’ recent injury.

Anthony Davis erased many of the team’s mistakes. Since the trade for Doncic, the team has responded by limiting gaffes, but everyone must be on a string. James might’ve been the most imposing paint presence the Lakers had left, although I don’t mean that to sound like high praise — the competition isn’t stiff. He certainly was the team’s best defensive communicator, barking orders from the backline. His absence for the next handful of games will stress LA’s defense. A poor showing against the G-League-tastic Nets last night wasn't a great start, and upcoming games against Milwaukee (twice), Denver (twice), and Phoenix promise to test the team further.

Still, the Lakers are fighting for a top-two seed in the West. They’ve been far better than I expected after the Doncic trade. While the defense may take a step back, the offense will almost inevitably improve as Doncic gains more familiarity with his teammates, which could accelerate with greater responsibility in James’ absence.

“Just shortcuts,” [Redick responded](https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/44201494) when asked about his team’s struggles against Brooklyn last night. “If you want to be a good team, if you want to win in the NBA, you have to do the hard stuff.” For nearly a third of the season, the Lakers have cut no corners.

Now, things get even harder. We’ll see if they're up for the challenge.

He’s done it in fewer minutes than anyone else of the top-15 scorers during this period, playing only 32 minutes a game.","Curry’s old.

And Old + More Minutes = bad combination. See: Kyrie Irving.

I know everyone has been focusing on how GSW has been great since the Butler trade, having gone 13-2 (one of those losses being a game Butler missed for rest), and also on how Curry has been lights out during this period now that he’s got someone else that opposing defenses need to focus on, and someone who’s a FT merchant and both keeps the defenses honest in the lane, and gets GSW in the penalty sooner, giving them more FTs.

But I think one of the overlooked factors is how because of Butler, despite this being the stage of the season where teams start ramping up player minutes cause they’re fighting for playoff positioning (which GSW is) Curry’s just had to play fewer minutes. In more than a quarter of the games, Curry hasn’t even passed 30 minutes. Multiple instances of him just chilling on the bench in the 4th. It is highly efficient scoring (not just from a % perspective, but a points per minute perspective), and is allowing Curry more rest than he otherwise would have gotten.

I don't have the stats on hand but whenever we shot more than 40% from three during Jimmy's time we had an insane winning percentage and conversely a terrible winning percentage when we shot less than that.

Jimmy will get you open and his shot diet creates space for shooters. He also slows down the pace of games with foul baiting so he gets his shooters a second wind and less tired legs.

I love Jimmy but I will definitely argue that his game's weakness in this era is that he won't usually take on the role of primary scorer if the threes aren't going down. He famously can, as 'playoff Jimmy' saved the Heat from a ton of games where we shot like shit, but it requires a ton of exertion and maybe even a playoff like game pace with longer possessions. 

Another wrinkle to Jimmy's game is that he can score against almost any defender when he wants to so when he gets going in that playoff mode it almost doesn't matter who is guarding him. Obviously he is susceptible to being double teamed and trapped so that should create much better looks for Steph in the playoffs or really anybody else on that team.

But TLDR whole thing really only works if the three ball falls at a good clip. I think they can win the West for real if they're shooting hot but I just want to flag right now for Dubs fans that maybe you'll get 4-5 playoff Jimmy games if you make it to the Finals but they won't be consecutive and if Steph is in a slump it might not be enough.

Dubs are +800 to win the West and +1800 to win the chip right now. If Steph is shooting hot and Jimmy doesn't have to use his Playoff Jimmy turbos until later series I think there is some serious value in that bet. || That’s crazy considering he’s had games like last night where he isn’t even looking to score since he’s been double and triple teamed and face guarded. || I was very skeptical of how this trade would work out due to the lack of 3 point shooting around Curry, but man I was wrong. Having just another guy who can create offense when needed is all you need with Steph. You saw the impact not having that has in the Sixers game where it was Steph trying to do it all. West is wide open IMO and I think Warriors are a legitimate threat || Butler's on/off is +11.3 for lineups that have played at least 10 minutes together. He's a great decision maker that also provides a scoring threat (as opposed to Wiggins who can only score, or Draymond who can primarily makes decisions) and elevates everyone. || Yeah, it's funny – like a lot of Warriors fans, I've been banging the drum for years to just get Steph a real second option and it'd change everything. But a large part of that is how much a real #2 makes sense of the rest of the roster, sliding everyone down into a role that better fits their skills. I wouldn't have necessarily predicted this immediate, straightforward impact where Jimmy arrives, and Steph goes nuclear and starts producing like it's 2016. Go figure, I guess.

I was looking into this a few days ago and found an interesting wrinkle. In the first 13 games of the Jimmy era (including the one he sat), the Warriors posted a 119.9 ORTG, 6th in the league in that span. This was largely powered by free throws (3rd in the league in FTA, 2nd in points at the line) and extra possessions (5th in 2nd chance points, 1st in points off turnovers by a huge margin); as a team they shot a pedestrian 34.4% from 3 (17th in the league). But Steph going psycho, and the emergence of Quinten Post, actually disguised how poorly they've been shooting – remove those two from the stretch, and the rest of the team shot a putrid 28.9% on 25 3s a night.

Couple ways to look at this. One is that they desperately need more shooting, which was one of the potential drawbacks of adding Jimmy (who's shooting like sub-20% from 3 since becoming a Warrior, to nobody's surprise). The other is that some positive regression is coming -- and indeed, in the 2 games since I looked all this up the non-Steph, non-Post Warriors have combined to go 30 for 51 from 3. Now it's *possible* that Gary Payton II won't continue to shoot 70% from the 3-point line the rest of the season, but I do think there's a happy medium where the open looks for guys like Moody and Podziemski start falling at a higher rate.

Anyway, totally agree with the overall point of how helpful Jimmy's presence has been for Steph. I think we're also still just digging into how this can cascade down to the rest of the roster and generate good offense even when Steph isn't in god mode. || Jimmy is by far, by far the most underrated player I've seen in basketball.

I remember the comments after the GSW trade very well. For some reason, many people just ignore what this guy is capable of. Maybe because they don't watch him and his stats alone are never that impressive. 

Jimmy has an incredible basketball IQ and he's oddly unselfish. You can't possibly understand his effect just by looking at his stats, because he certainly doesn't cRe about them himself.

He will give you whatever you need, whenever you need it. Can be your first scoring option, primary ball handler or just a glue guy. All depending on what the team needs at that moment. || jimmy creates offensive opportunities for steph and the rest of their 3pt shooters and steph being on the court leads to open shots for jimmy and all the inside/ mid range scorers. it’s a perfect match || This team is going to be an absolute nightmare for most teams in the west come playoff time. Jimmy completely opens up the floor for Steph and allows him to move much more freely off the ball.

They’re definitely making a run at the WCF, and if the chips line up, I could see them winning the West. || The Lakers just had a very hot streak and have now cooled off.  The Warriors still have to play the Nuggets twice, the Bucks, the Grizzlies, Lakers, and Rockets, and I'm leaving out the Knicks and Hawks, who should at least not necessarily be walkovers.

Which makes sense, it's gonna be more effective against the smaller player, and you can't effectively double 2 players in the NBA. 


And if that line-up w Steph, Dray, Jimmy, Kuminga, and Podz/Moody start closing effectively, that's a really intriguing line-up in the playoffs, outstanding balance of scoring and defense.


But as you seem to suggest, I think you gotta double Steph and force Jimmy and the supporting cast score buckets.

During this 13-2 stretch they've pulled out several games against middling-to-bad competition that they absolutely would have lost earlier in the season.

Not saying they don't have anything to prove (particularly against Denver), but rather that ""can they win the games they're supposed to win?"" has been, for the Steph-and-some-guys era, as much of a question as ""can they beat the top teams?"" I genuinely think that as good as it was to beat the Knicks in the Garden on a B2B (best win of the Butler era), it was just as important to see them win the obvious trap game in Brooklyn two nights later. || Agreed that they've had the advantage of a weaker schedule, but I don't think they go on this run without Jimmy. They can only play who is on the schedule, and they've done about as well as you could ask for. We'll see how it goes as competition ramps up.

In a playoff matchups, Denver is going to be rightfully favored, but in my opinion, the Warriors might have enough different pieces to have a shot against anyone. Before this, I don't think you could reasonably say that. || LeBron has been out for LA || Yeah, I would wait for the honeymoon period to wear off before I would come to any greater conclusions - this happens all the time near the end of the season, where teams who press the ""win now"" button run into an array of teams pressing the ""lose now"" button and seem invincible.

My only point is that I can't imagine he would score 30+ in consecutive games or more than once or twice a series so Steph absolutely has to shoot well for them be able to take on teams with more talent. I don't think there is enough offensive firepower on the Dubs roster to overcome OKC or the Nuggets if Steph is on a shooting slump, even if you get Goku Jimmy once or twice.

Stephen Curry,"""Stephen Curry"" OR ""Chef Curry"" OR ""Steph"" OR ""Curry"" OR ""Stephen""",2025-03-13,nbadiscussion,1jb1nw4,Glass Cannon players and building rosters,"Donovan Clingan is a modern glass cannon. He's  elite at offensive rebounding, and has defensive rim numbers that are equivalent to Wembenyama. But he's got no perimeter shot, his 290 frame struggles in space, and he's probably going to have career injury problems everyone that size has. 

A glass cannon is a guy ridiculously overpowered in certain areas, but also exceedingly vulnerable in others. In RPG games he'd be that wizard who can magic missile a mountainside, but because he's old and squishy you can one shot him right off the board.

Players in this mold are always situational and stressful.  Some nights they are the linchpin to a 30 point beatdown, and others they're virtually unplayable. 

The coach and teammates will always be on the edge, looking for signs that the good outweighs the bad. You have to have specific play styles to make him work, and you are more limited on teammates you can pare with him.

But it's not all bad. The risk is often worth the reward. Shaq, Iverson and to some extent Curry were all glass cannons stars (fucking howitzers!) Gobert is the modern poster boy for the modern highly successful glass cannon role player. Dennis Rodman may be the all time glass cannon role player. 

This type of guy can be great. But you have to be clear the juice is worth the squeeze. Nobody projects Clingan to be Shaq-tier, but Gobert is achievable. 

It's interesting to project young glass cannons based on where the league is headed. Most would say his lack of perimeter play  is a really bad omen. 

But one reason I think Clingan's worth it is the recent dominance of interior players. Jokic and Embiid have been camped at the topped on the MVP list. Ja, SGA and Giannis are going to destroy you at the rim if you don't have someone who can make them think twice. It's inevitable that Wemby will be next. 

Clingan is a specific solution to a specific problem in our league--a problem you have to solve to win at the highest levels.

The key is to build around him the right way, work on his vulnerabilities as much as you can, and for God's sakes don't hand him a Gobert contract that hamstrings your roster's flexibility. Because you'll need that flexibility to make him work. 

Is Clingan a building block for the future? Eh, he's more like the statue you put in front of the building.  You can see him plainly every night, but he's not like Deni Avdija or Toumani Camara where you know you can use him in any situation no matter what. 

I absolutely love Clingan. When he's levelling mountain sides it's so much fun to watch. But you have to be dead certain about glass cannons if you really want to consider them foundational pieces. I'm not there yet.

Glass cannon stars and glass cannon role players live in entirely different spheres. You can easily decide to mold a team around a prime Steph. But finding the right fit for Draymond Green outside of Golden State is a lot harder. (Part of Green's glass is psychological.  His bullshit would wear thin on many teams.) 

Glass cannons, I suppose, are basically the polar opposites of the jack-of-all-trades. The biggest nit you can pick about Jason Tatum is that he's not enough of a cannon. But you can plug him into any playoff team in the league and likely contend instantly. 

Portland never built a roster around the glass cannon of Dame Lillard. We paired him with a less powerful cannon in CJ and wasted most of his prime. 

In Portland, Sharp, Tou, Deni and Scoot (yes he's actually starting to look good) are our cornerstones. We're the youngest team in the league, and we need guys with flexibility to mold around the star that hopefully emerges. 

Clingan isn't a cornerstone.  I want him to be, but I just don't think he's got the skills and talent to rise above glass cannon role player.

Like, there's a palpable hate and disgust to it. Just such a negative and cynical way to view players and the game IMO. || Dunno, Clingan's shot isn't nonexistent, it can be worked on. I don't think Gobert is a good comp for him, he's not useless on offence || Shaq was absolutely not a glass cannon. He was elite or above average in every phase of the game except jump shooting. || You know the interesting, overlooked glass cannon guys. Volume scoring guards without much else. It looks so good and they're absurdly skilled, but they actually hamper team building unless you bring them off the bench. || Just wanna say I really enjoyed reading this, your writing style is very engaging || I always figured Mark Eaton and to some extent James Donaldson only existed to stop Kareem  or at least make him work harder (harder to finesse a big guy than shoot over a small guy like Duncan over LJ).

They also minimize the star's defensive impact since they're stuck keeping a non threat off the offensive boards.

I wonder why Tacko Fall couldn't establish a role as a foil for Embiid.  (I guess Embiids body foiled itself, Giannis, Wemby, AD are too quick, and Jokic too much of a playmaker to be stopped this way...leaving no one else to face except Clingan/edey) || Jokic. He orchestrates a beautiful offense while standing completely still on the other end as if he were cosplaying a traffic cone.  || Yeah no one calls a one dimensional tank a glass cannon. || Yeah. In RPGs it's cloth wearing magic users that can cast spells that do ridiculous damage but are easy to kill. An NBA equivalent would be Kyrie Irving, or Anthony Davis, I Zion Williamson, back in the day Bill Walton. Everyone knows they are great, but they easily get injured. 

Not all big men are injury prone. There is no evidence Clingan will be this. Robert Parish and Kareem were both big men and they have played more games than LeBron. 

Actually 7 of the top 10 games played for their career leaders are big men. In fact it's guards that usually have shorter careers. 

Sure some big men due to their size have lingering issues that do limit them, but we quite frankly don't know if Clingan is going to be one of those guys. So we can't really call him a ""glass cannon"" imo. || Oh yeah he was actually a great example of borderline star glass cannon. || > The warriors were able to build well around him with great defenders at the 2-5

Thats a lot because of Steph. In this day and age of 4-1 or 5 out he managed to win a championship with Looney at center and Draymond at PF. Both provided no spacing/rimpressure/scoring. 

Kerr has always relied on Curry to provide just enough offense to otherwise defensively slanted teams. 

While he's not even close to elite defensively as an individual, he is pretty good as a team defender and brings a whole lot in the macro sense if you consider it as him giving them the opportunity to build from the back without worrying too much about shooting etc. 

Jokic' teams have constantly been middle of the pack defensively (with the notable exception of drtg#8 in their title year), because they build from the front - accentuating his strenghts.

However, quantifying this concept has seemed impossible until now (well, maybe not, but I gave it a try anyway).

No player in the world creates fear or has a gravitational pull off the ball like Steph Curry; he’s one of a kind. What is that type of fear worth to the Golden State offense?

… 11.6 points per 100 possessions.

Stick with me here.

Curry leads the league in Off-Ball Screens run this season with 1,086 total actions. These are all non-on-ball reps, so the defensive shell should NOT be centered on his action. In theory, the defensive spacing should be based on where the ball is located. So, these actions will show his gravitational pull without the ball in his hands.

I filtered these actions for a 400-action minimum, the Top 55 players in volume.

**Curry’s Off-Ball Screen:**

* Touch Percentage: 17th (65.8%)
* Points Per Direct: 11th (1.160)
* Points Per Possession: 1st (1.276)

The difference between Curry’s points per direct number (1.160) and the Golden State points per possession number (1.276) is 0.116 points per possession, which translates to 11.6 points over 100 possessions. That’s the value of Steph Curry’s off-ball gravity to the Golden State offense.

I’m sure more intelligent people than me would know how to factor in the touch percentage, but I don’t have as much big brain energy as those people, so 11.6 per 100 it is.

It's not an easy thing to quantify things in basketball. And trying to quantify off-ball gravity is interesting. Have you watched last game against the Kings. His man was glued to him all the time, and sometimes Steph would just stand far from the ball and let his teamates play 4 on 4. Is there a way to quantify that? There was a play where Kuminga dunked and Steph just walked away and he pulled his defender without any screen. I think it will be hard to quantify these kind of plays. || This thought came from preparing for a Golden State podcast with Eric Apricot from DubNationHQ.

There was a chart going around several years ago that showed Warriors’ players TS% with and without Steph on the court. Everyone shot 2-4% better with Steph on the court. And his impact was way more than even guys like Bron and prime Harden. 

I maintain that his offensive impact is still very under appreciated. Who else in the league would have been able to lead an offense with Wiggins as the number 2 all the way to a championship? || Surely there’s a little bit more in terms of numbers you’d have to run here. Like if I take any random player in the league, and find the delta between their direct and team ppp per screening action, if that resulting number is positive i don’t feel like you could be saying that this delta is all points directly resulting from that players off ball gravity, right? 

It seems like you’d have to be taking relative numbers, both within the team and between teams to establish something like this, I think the calculation would have to be a lot more complicated. Maybe the number you’ve come up with could be used as more of a general “off ball impact” metric, but it doesn’t seem to me like it can be used to simply quantify how many points a players off ball gravity is worth. || When people have tried to answer the theoretically simpler question of what is Steph Curry overall worth to Golden State's offense through something like on/off data, it usually results in a pretty similar number to this throughout his career.

If you place this value on his off ball gravity, then it essentially attributes like 95% maybe up to even 100% of Curry's net offensive value to off ball gravity, which doesn't seem quite right as he contributes positively in other ways. But if you had a framework for measuring offensive impact and then separating that out into categories that include off ball gravity maybe it would be the biggest component. || This is something I've had to point out to people with dumb takes like ""KD/Draymond were the engine of the offense"". Curry constantly moving off-ball and throwing team defenses into disarray just because of his lethal catch-and-shoot skills is what allowed everybody else in Golden State to eat for years. Draymond, Wiggins, Poole, etc are all seen as better when alongside Curry than without. || It's so hard to quantify without watching the games at a deeper level. 

That's why Steph has always been one of the hardest superstars to rank. And it's the reason why he's only given 1 FMVP instead of 4. He is the entire warriors offense even when he doesn't have the ball. He's the first star of this kind. 

He commands the most gravity we've ever seen, but also the entire team is built to take advantage of his gravity. || While an interesting effort in nerdom... Please, can we stop trying to ""calculate"" ever aspect of the game, and just Watch and Appreciate it? 

Why can't this analytics generation just be satisfied with ""intangibles"" ???

Don't get me wrong, as a math nerd I have some respect for stuff like this and I do find it interesting. 

But, analytics has killed so much of the game and the fandom. Now people think they understand players and games just by looking at numbers and random highlights, instead of watching games. Maybe part of why ratings are down || Do you think Reggie miller was close to curry in terms of off ball movement? || This is actually what propelled Steph and Klay to be so good together. Yes they are both individually amazing shooters, but the off ball gravity combined with ball movement created by each allowed the other to get basically wide open looks all the time. || Touch % - how often SC touches the ball when running an off-ball screen. So, 2/3 of the time here. 

Points per direct - points scored when he's directly involved.

So, plays when two guys go to SC, and someone gets a slip pass off of it do not count toward the number, but they do toward points per possession. 

That's where this gravity valuation is coming from. || In addition to what these mean, which is not clear as per above, how do these compare to league avg or other top players?

Just the threats that he can turn a pin down into a get action turns up the Fear! || If Curry is touching the ball on 2/3 of ALL his off ball screens he is the center of the play and the defense would be focused on him being the recipient of the action.

Not in a “all of these guys are super stars” sense, but each player on the team has a specific role to fill a team need and every single one of them execute that role to perfection. Having like 7 of the leagues best defenders doesn’t hurt either. || MVPs are often one-man shows—and those kinds of teams rarely go far in the playoffs.

Take Jokic this season: he might win MVP, but the Nuggets aren’t going anywhere.

Makes you wonder how valuable the MVP really is. || Because it’s a team sport, including the bench, and the average player is much better compared to the average player back then.

This is why even having two superstar players is not enough. All the teams that have won lately have had bench players making huge plays then securing a bag before being traded at higher value.

FVV, Poole, GP2, Gabe Vincent (Finals) || It’s just luck.  

2023 Nikola Jokic (2nd in MVP following back to back)

2021 Giannis Antetokounmpo (4th in MVP following back to back)

2020 LeBron James (2nd in MVP voting)

2017-18 Stephen Curry (Super Team following Back to Back).

2016 LeBron James (3rd in MVP 2 years removed from 4/5).


You shift the title winners a year or two in a different direction, and this doesn’t happen.  The champs have been led by MVP level guys per usual. || Part of it is just chance. Let’s say that roughly 6 teams each year have a legitimate chance to win the finals, and 1 of those teams has the MVP. For the sake of argument, let’s say each of those 6 teams has an equal chance of winning, meaning the chances of the MVP winning are 1/6. It’s not that unbelievable for a 1/6 chance to not occur over a 10 year stretch.

There’s also the factor that the MVP doesn’t usually go to the really good teams, because the teams with amazing rosters don’t have 1 guy carrying them. Look at the 2016-19 Warriors. KD and Steph were the concensus #2 and #3 (order for those two is debatable) players in the league, and on by far the best team. Neither came really close to the MVP conversation though, because the team was so stacked that you couldn’t give any one guy the MVP. If your team would still be a title contender with one of your superstars off of it, then that superstar has absolutely no business being considered as the most valuable player. The 17-19 warriors are an extreme example where you couldn’t crown any guy the MVP when it was up for debate who the best player on the team was, but the point still stands. || It’s not that MVP doesn’t matter as much for championships but the last 10 years especially there’s just been certain players that have undeniably deserved the MVP but were not on MVP caliber teams or the teams got injured. 

Giannis won back to back but the team suffered injuries but won the year right after the second because the team stayed healthy.

Jokic won 2 in a row and the voters didn’t want to give him a third and embiid gave them a reason by scoring 35 a game with very close to jokic efficiency and that ended up being the year jokic wins the chip.

James harden shouldnt have won the mvp. 

Westbrook only won it because it was either the second or third year in a row he averaged a triple double by stat padding and the voters couldn’t ignore it anymore. 

Then you got the year curry won the mvp but lost to lebron in the finals cause of draymond green got suspended. But I think lebron would have won anyway. 

Technically it’s just coincidence considering the context. || This is why I think the Thunder won’t win the championship. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is likely not going to become the 10th or whatever player to ever do this || Probably just coincidence more than anything. 

2016: Warriors inexplicably blow 3-1 lead

2017: Westbrook has ridiculous season, but Warriors are overwhelming

2018: Rockets lose in 7 in a series they probably should have won.

2019: Giannis is a victim of “the wall” & Toronto goes on a crazy run.

2020: Giannis gets injured in the bubble; LeBron finished 2nd in voting and might have gotten the nod if they hadn’t stopped the season early.

2021: Nuggets probably didn’t have a real shot w/o Murray.

2022: No Murray for Nugs; lost to eventual champ GSW.

2023: Philly chokes 3-2 lead in 2nd round

2024: Nugs run out of gas in 7 games in a winnable series in the 2nd round.

Only like twice did the MVP come from a team that didn’t have a real shot at the title. They are generally on very good teams. || 3 big reasons:

1 - multiple MVPs during those years were extremely close, such as Curry being up 3-1 in the finals before a bs suspension to Draymond, Harden being up 3-2 on the Durant warriors before the Rockets missed 27 straight 3’s, and Giannis being up 2-0 in the ECF and having double digit leads in at least 2 of the losses. 

2 - several players were denied MVPs for basically narrative or team related situations. Durant and curry cancelled each other out but Durant should have won at least one MVP if the only criteria was being the best player in the league. Jokic got denied 3 straight and so did Giannis at least a little bit due to voter fatigue, and they both won a championship the year they would have won the third. 

3 - MVP used to be an award that had an enormous team component to it in that you basically had to be one of the top teams and a serious contender to get consideration for MVP. Jokic winning MVPs while not being a remote contender for a ring those first 2 years kinda broke that idea since a lot of people just want to give it to the guy with the best stats every time now. 10 years ago there would have been 0 debate between who would get MVP between Shai and Jokic this year. || Kyrie shattered his knee into a trillion pieces and Kelly Olynk attempted to murder Kevin Love.

Stephen Curry,"""Stephen Curry"" OR ""Chef Curry"" OR ""Steph"" OR ""Curry"" OR ""Stephen""",2025-03-20,nbadiscussion,1jg2001,Why doesn't KD win?,"Charles Barkley once famously said that Kevin Durant could never win a championship as a ""Bus Driver.""

And this current season feels like testament to that - He's still highly efficient, 52/41/83 (64TS), but the Suns are struggling to find a play-in spot.

Comparing Lebron, Steph, and KD, Durant doesn't seem to move the W column that much.

The '16 Thunder had 55 wins with KD, and the '17 Thunder had 47 wins without him. Meanwhile, '10 Cavs with LeBron had 61 wins and then 19 wins that following year without him.

And then Steph had his injury year which made the Warriors a lottery team, although a lot of others were injured too, but KD doesn't seem anywhere close to being a player that adds to the win columns like the other two.

Which is perplexing because he is consistently added to All-Time starting 5 lists. Arguably the greatest scorer ever, the most efficient scorer ever, so then what is it about his game that isn't able to translate to Wins?

Can he not just brute force a win, taking 30+ FGAs a game like Kobe or Jordan did on a consistent basis? Is fatigue an issue? He's doesn't necessarily contain the athletic build to sustain high energy possessions for 35+ minutes a night, could that be it?

Is it true that KD could never have a championship ring if he is option 1?",1117,692,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jg2001/why_doesnt_kd_win/,2025-03-20 18:46:03,"He excels in scoring, but ue doesn't take more attempts than he should. And sometimes he should be doing that as the number 1 option. He also doesn't have playmaking abilities as the others you've mentioned. He excels with a point guard next to him. || His playmaking was never that great - see how Iguodala bothered him and Warriors forced him into multiple turnovers in 2016. But it’s really fallen off since the injuries.  || Most of KDs teams have been really poorly constructed. KD loves and respects ISO street ball style players, and so he often has a bunch of teammates that are also 1v1 guys, like he did in Brooklyn and Phoenix. It's just redundant, guys taking turns. 

I think KD is incredible, but I don't think he makes his teammates that much better like a facilitator does. || I think he’s more of a ceiling raiser then he is a floor lifter. If u get him to a high leverage moment and need him to outduel someone to win he’s maybe the best weapon in league history at that (two time finals mvp) however he hasn’t been able to leverage that in ways that benefit his team. It’s a hard thing to quantify, you could do it directly with LeBron’s playmaking, indirectly with Curry’s gravity, or like giannis being a one man defense and wrecking ball when they won the title. KD certainly isn’t a turnover machine, a fine defender (great when he wants to be) and he isn’t ball dominant either so he doesn’t have any glaring red flags -but he just hasn’t been able to weaponize his off ball skills in a way to “lift all boats” so to speak. Man is just the most efficient and inevitable bucket getter in the league -maybe ever. Which definitely is a large portion of the game, and is usually the deciding factor in games, but he never really evolved to leverage his traits to amplify his teammates (not calling him a bad team mate or even a bad playmaker at all he just… doesn’t make them better) || Look, Kevin Durant is the ultimate glass-cannon DPS. The man is a seven-foot sniper with the agility of a rogue and the precision of an elven archer, but that’s all he is. You drop him in any system, and he’s gonna rack up a 40-piece like he just specced into critical damage. But the problem is, you can’t win a championship when your party is just a maxed-out ranger with zero tank or leadership perks. The man’s been on multiple superteams, but the second a boss fight gets dicey, he’s looking around like, “Uh, who’s got aggro?” Bro, YOU’RE the legendary hero! Why are you acting like a loot-hungry rogue who dips when the raid wipes?

Meanwhile, every successful championship team has had a fighter-type class leading the charge. Jordan? Prime melee DPS with tanky resolve. Kobe? Warlock multiclass with Black Mamba debuffs. LeBron? A damn Paladin with max charisma and AoE leadership buffs. But KD? He’s that overpowered mage who keeps screaming “Where’s my support?!” when the cleric is out of spell slots. Give him a tank like Steph or Booker to draw fire, and sure, he’ll melt defenses like he’s running a busted build—but the second he has to frontline? He’s alt-tabbing to Twitter mid-battle. || Stat pads for efficiency and is just obsessed with system basketball 

Sure. Clearly bad shots aren’t gonna make winning plays. But you have to worry less about efficiency and play to win. 

Dudes just a perfectionist who is a great number 2 option. Probably the best scorer ever but would rather score 27 a game at 50-37-88 splits rather than 35 a game at 45-35-88 which is where you’d do more winning. 

If he stopped deferring in OKC they’d have won. Russ wasn’t scared to shoot, but it should’ve been KD. Russ got flamed for being inefficient but KD was so passive. || I think a large of this is him not being in his prime. Last couple years both LeBron and Steph have been borderline play in teams as well. That Nets Bucks series was nearly 4 years ago. I realized that as I typed this. I believe he’s been capable, he won MVP largely because of that. He’s still a great scorer but doesn’t generate much rim pressure or the presence of other stars. Doesn’t draw as many free throws. Never been a great playmaker either. Capable , but not a consistent defensive stopper. He doesn’t solve or mask any weaknesses in Phoenix. || Nobody in the history of the NBA has ""brute force a win"" NBA title like you imply, not Jordan, not Kobe, not even Wilt who put up about as inhuman a single person offense as you can imagine; it is a team game and only one team every year so you need to be in the right place at the right time. Had injuries not lined up wrong on the Thunder KD probably would have at least one title there, in the same way had Magic not had HIV he might have played long enough to get some late career rings with Kobe and Shaq, or had Barkley been traded to Portland like he wanted, the Blazers might have won against Chicago. To assume ex post facto psychological explanations for the breaks of the game is generally not going to shed a lot of light on what happened || There’s a multitude of reasons but I’ll add that first and foremost it’s really fucking hard to win a title. Asking ‘why doesn’t KD win?’ Really dumbs it down || I think for any stars that want to make it to the Finals they either have to have an elite playmaker next to them or they themselves needs to be a great passer.  If you look at the players with Finals appearances in recent years, you have Giannis, Jokic, LeBron, Curry, Tatum, Kobe, Wade...all great players that is also great to elite at playmaking.  Durant would most likely be the weakest passer in that group.  I think that partially explains why.

Not sure why this doesn't apply to Harden though || The reason is this and I’m surprised nobody has said it: he doesn’t elevate his teammates to championship level. 

KD is gonna give you buckets and solid defense, but he only plays his role. He doesn’t elevate his squad the way lebron, Luka, Steph, and jokic do. 

Unless a great roster is constructed around him, he will never be able to win a championship as the bus driver. || So many people in here are missing the point.

For starters ive seen multiple people say shitty roster construction..? what?
What Thunder teams post 2012 finals appearance had bad roster construction?

Bad luck is the #1 reason he didn't win with OKC.
Russell injury in 2013 - his broken foot in 2015. 2016 was their chance, imo they were THE best team in the playoffs that year. Taking down a 67 win (!!!!) spurs team then almost knocking out the 73win warriors? Who has a path like that thru their conference before?

2016 was biggest showcase of KDs fatal flaw as a player which a lot of ppl have been saying: he doesn't ""rise"" to the moment and he doesn't necessarily elevate his teammates

KD is a pure hooper but I can't really think of any 2012 Lebron ECF Game 6 kind of moments for KD. He's not gonna put up 30+ shots to avoid elimination.
He's gonna play his game... and his game is COLD.. but he's only gonna play HIS game HIS way. 

I'd also say not winning with the Nets was bad luck too.
He was a toe away from likely winning a ring there - and we can't forget the bad injury luck and off court shit they had whole time he was there.

With the Suns - yea James Jones is a dog shit GM. Add age, chronic injury, temperament.. and there u go || Leadership. KD doesn’t want to lead—just play.

I appreciate that, whether or not you want him as your lead dog is an easy no.

KD is about KD. It’s not malicious, but he’s just not a team guy. || I think with the Thunder the blame was on the FO than anything else. They set the team back with the Harden trade, like brutally, they lost a lot of their dynamic when Harden left.

Then losing Harden coincides with the rise of the Kawhi Spurs, Harden Rockets and The Warriors, it was a lot to overcome with it just being him and Russ.

He wins with the Warriors because they’re a completely different team that was built with depth and systems outside of him. And he wins, overwhelming force will do that.

Nets were a disaster because of the FO. Capitulating to Stars is never a wise move. Got rid of Jarrett Allen for a broken DeAndre Ayton. Pushed tor Steve Nash. They sacrificed depth which was the problem in OKC. They then add Harden but again. Depth and Injuries. And after Harden left KD was just too old and injured at that point.

His defense which was never spectacular kind of fell off and the Suns gutted their whole depth and future to acquire KD and then Beal. || He’s a tall Carmelo. He needs to be carried on a championship team because outside of easily scoring next to one of the greatest players of all time who was always doubled he has little to offer. Scoring efficiently even at the PPG he gets isn’t enough to win it all. To lead a team to a championship you need to have good to elite playmaking and he severely lacks in that and cannot pass out of double teams. For all his faults Harden is unironically the better player when you look at play off success and carrying teams. Look at any non-Curry team he’s been on. He has only made one finals and lost Curry he can’t even get out of the first round even though he’s been ring chasing on super teams. He ranks behind LeBron, Curry, Kawhi, Jokic, Butler and Harden when it comes to leading a team to play off success and shouldn’t be listed in the same tier as these players going forward. || He scores and defends his man well. He doesn't make the players around him better, and he doesn't seem to push them in practice either since he keeps to himself. One of the best 1v1 players, maybe the best, ever, but basketball is 5v5 and what he does doesn't elevate the other 4 players on the floor with him. || I think he just isn’t a good enough defender or playmaker to win as the number one option. Kobe and Jordan also played in a different era where you didn’t need to do as much as a number one option to win. 

I would say KD closest comp to a player who was the bus driver in the last decade is Kawhi. Unlike Kawhi tho he isn’t an all league defender. || Because the Suns roster is terrible outside of KD & Book? People don't like KD because of his tenure with the Dubs, but he can absolutely be a bus driver. Additionally, not every all-time great is a floor raiser the way that LeBron and Steph are. || I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again KD is the ultimate plug and play scoring talent maybe ever. He was literally the perfect piece to fit into GSW to make them unbeatable due to his greatest strength being elite scorer w/o being heliocentric. However because he’s purely a scorer if he is the entire offense it won’t be as effective as a LeBron/steph led offense because LeBron/steph are offensive system’s themselves.

Best analogy: LeBron/steph are the main course of a meal while KD is an amazing side dish which sometimes is even better than the main course. || these are horrible cherrypicked comparisons that make it hard to believe you're arguing in good faith.

more than just lebron left after 2010, the 2017 thunder literally had the mvp on it

if you want him brute forcing a win like kobe and jordan look at the entire nets vs bucks series

and he lead his team to the finals as a number 1 option in 2012

this entire argument makes no sense because winning in the regular season is still winning. its not like he never had success in the playoffs either, leading your team to the finals is winning. so yes he does ""win"" || Suns are 31-26 when he plays this season, and 2-11 without him. Anyone saying his game doesn’t translate to winning is just completely false. The roster outside of the ‘big’ 3 is nowhere near good enough. || Winning in the NBA consistently is extremely hard and is dependent on the talent and coaching around you as well as your competition. 

Kevin Durant definitely impacts winning. He is 15th in NBA history in win shares [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ws\_career.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ws_career.html) and 8th in VOORP which shows how irreplacable a player is: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/vorp\_career.html. 

No, KD could have certainly (and still can) win a ring as the best player. In Game 2 of the 2012 Finals, the refs missed a call where LeBron placed his forearm into Kevin Durant's chest which could have completely changed that series. If the Thunder wins that series, does that change your view on Kevin Durant?

 LeBron and Steph have been blessed to have healthy teammates during their championship runs. Kevin Durant has missed 3 opportunities to win a title in 2015, 2019, and 2020 when he experienced a Jones fracture and tore his Achilles in the 2019 finals, missing that finals and the entire 2020 season. What if Kevin Durant's team wins a title during 2015 and 2020 if he was healthy? What if he leads a 3-1 in the 2019 Finals if he was healthy? These very real plausible hypothetical are ignored by fans even though basketball is a game of inches and attrition.

This is why I never judge players based on their championships but only on their impact on winning. I still believe LeBron and Curry are more impactful players than Durant, but it is not because they have more titles.

By using your logic of win counts, you also failed to mention that in 2015 when Durant injured his foot, the Thunder missed the playoffs that year when he was not healthy at around 45 wins despite Westbrook's heroics that season. Even just using win counts for a season is unfair as the talent around the league is different year to year, your teammates have a huge impact on the win column, injuries can happen, and circumstances change each year. || This is a really interesting question, I think.

When KD was here in OKC, he was obviously the most talented player, but even he made the point to say that Russell Westbrook was the leader of the team.

When he went to the Warriors, again he was obviously the most talented player, but Steph and the Gang had already won and been winning without him, so it was easy to simply upgrade their roster from Harrison Barnes to Kevin Durant and achieve the expected results. KD won two FMVP's, but no one would ever question ""are these KD's teams or Steph's?"" because the answer was obvious. And then that same team won another title without him a couple years later, further proving that he didn't make THAT much of a difference.

His attempts to be The Man in Brooklyn and Phoenix have not resulted in anything close to the results he had before, and yeah if the Mavs didn't decide to ruin their entire organization, the Suns wouldn't even be in the play-in conversation.

Why doesn't he affect winning? I'm not really sure, except that it must be some sort of locker room leadership kind of thing. He puts up numbers on the court. Beal and Booker have not missed significant time this season (time, but not a ton) and yet the team needed to be gifted the 10 seed and limp into the playoffs. I don't care about the rest of the roster, with those three there should be better results, unless Beal and Booker are both also the type of guys that can put up good numbers on bad teams but not really affect winning, which seems like it might be the case. || People just say shit because they hate KD and use the lame bus driver argument. He’s one of the 3 best players 2010s players and a top 20 all time player, of course he can win a chip being number 1. With his skillset he can fit on any team. You’re dismissing 3 years because he was on one of the greatest teams of all time. No one has ever used that argument against Kobe’s first 3 rings or Magic with Kareem. 

2012, a 23 year old KD carried the baby thunder to finals favorites and could’ve won if they had a competent coach. With Brooklyn they were prohibitive favorites and dominating before the injuries. Suns looked amazing before cp3 got hurt and ayton quit. He likely wins one on OKC if he stayed, he was definitely due. There’s no doubt he can play on the big stage || He’s just a basketball playing mirage. He appears to be dominate at basketball but when push comes to shove he can’t even convince his teammates he’s the best player on his team. Westbrook, Curry, Kyrie, and now Booker are the actual go to guys.  || A lot of people giving basketball reasons but I think there's an obvious one that's not actually about his play style at all.

His prime aligned with Bron's. OKC would've probably won a championship if it didn't. That's not to discount Boston who was absolutely capable of beating OKC, but I do think the Heat were just a harder out for OKC that season. And if they do win, does OKC drag their feet on extending Harden? It could've kept that team together for much longer than they did. || Of course he was good enough to win as a #1 option he just didnt. 1 of 30 teams wins every year. Its really hard and has a ton of random chance and luck involved. He just didnt catch the breaks in OKC, we know the GSW run...then his Brooklyn and Suns teams just werent good enough || His style of play is too passive. He's still a great player, but he doesn't impose his will on the game most of the time. He also gets weaker as the game progresses. He should have lifted weights a little more . || The Thunder didn't become a dynasty in large part because Durant was not the leader everyone expected him to be during that time. His skills are extraordinary but he functions best under a leader like Curry. || I been saying this, Durant is a pure scorer maybe one of the best but he could care less about anything else. Without the 2 rings he would be in the same category as Carmelo Anthony.",0.506,0.494,0.0,-0.4717,0.11,0.703,0.187,0.9794,0.096,0.689,0.215,0.9999
Stephen Curry,"""Stephen Curry"" OR ""Chef Curry"" OR ""Steph"" OR ""Curry"" OR ""Stephen""",2025-04-01,nbadiscussion,1jpah3q,Hornets/Pelicans Franchise History,"Ok, let me start off by saying I am not a fan of either of these teams in any way, nor do I live in either of the cities. I probably care too much about this topic, but I am too invested in it and have to make this little rant. The history of the Hornets crossed my mind because I’m a Lakers fan, and I know Kobe got drafted by the Hornets (kind of).

I am 22 years old, and when I was a kid, the New Orleans team was the Hornets, and I learned that they used to play in Charlotte. At the time, Charlotte’s team was called the Bobcats. I remember when NOLA rebranded as the Pelicans, and I thought, “huh, cool”. I remember when Charlotte rebranded from the Bobcats and renamed themselves the Hornets. Again, “huh, cool”. I thought it was weird that they took a name that belonged to another team just over a year ago, but it is what it is, and they have that right. I thought that way at the time and have for the last decade.

But I never knew about the agreement the teams had in 2014 to transfer history over, and I (who I thought was a hardcore NBA fan) am literally just learning about this today.

Just to be clear, I fully understand the process of how the current Hornets and current Pelicans franchises got here. I understand the timeline, the relocation, the rebranding, and the 2014 “history agreement”. My problem is that I wholeheartedly disagree with this “agreement” the teams had to “transfer the history” of the 1988-2002 Hornets to the current Charlotte Hornets team.

The current team did not start in 1988. It just didn’t. It started in 2004. As the Bobcats. They played (and poorly so, though that’s not the point) as the Bobcats until 2014, when they wanted to rename themselves as the Hornets. All fine and good and well with me. But how can they claim that points or any other statistics scored by players by the 1988-2002 Hornets were scored for their franchise? That’s just not the case.

And even though they got those stats for a Charlotte team, you don’t play for a city, you play for a franchise (sorry to the people of Charlotte if you find this offensive).

A basketball team was brought in in 1988 that played in a city until 2002 and then relocated to another city and has played there ever since (barring 2 years when they were forced to play in OKC, which is besides the point). All the roster moves (trades, FA signings, coaching and staff changes) by that team created in 1988 and onwards have gotten them, the PELICANS, to where they are now. None of those roster decisions have anything to do with the current Hornets, so whey do they get to claim historical records by former Pelicans’ organization players?

I understand the desire to attribute a city name to a team name, I even understand why the word “Hornet” has a special meaning in Charlotte. But you can’t (or, at least, shouldn’t be allowed to) transfer history.

If the Hornets had, say, won a championship from 1988 through 2002, I don’t think the Pelicans would have done this history transfer agreement (I understand that means they probably wouldn’t have ever left Charlotte if they had won, but that’s not the point). The Lakers won 5 in Minneapolis, those belong to the current Lakers organization, not the Wolves. As it should be.

Dell Curry, for example, is the CURRENT FRANCHISE LEADER in games played for the current Hornets, when this current organization never drafted him, never signed him, never traded for him, nothing. In my opinion, he never played for this franchise, and that opinion will never change, but it is what it is.

If there were a trivia question about which of the current teams is the newest, the “correct” answer by the NBA’s rule would be the Pelicans because they are now considered a 2002 expansion team. The problem is that they weren’t an expansion team in 2002; they just relocated.

If there were a trivia question about which of the current franchises drafted Kobe, it would be Charlotte, when the organization that actually drafted him went on to NOLA and is now the Pelicans.

Again, I get all of it. The fans of Charlotte that watched the team from 1988-2002 want to have the ability to claim the history then for the team now, but that’s just not right in my view.

Ok, I am done with my rant. I want to know how other fans, especially Hornets and Pelicans fans, think about this. I am also curious if there are people out there who are fans of the Pelicans now that maybe live/lived in Charlotte and once rooted for them when they played there, and have stuck with that franchise instead? Or did you leave it behind when the Bobcats were introduced and are now a Hornets fan? I don’t judge you one way or the other, I am just really curious about that, and what you think of the history transfer and if you agree with it or not.

Also, I wonder if this ever gets mentioned ever during broadcasts for either team when stats are brought up, and if when the two teams play each other, does this ever get mentioned by fans at the games?",7,16,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jpah3q/hornetspelicans_franchise_history/,2025-04-01 19:41:45,"Long story short the Hornets meant (and still do) A LOT to the city. And Charlotte fans were screwed over by Shinn moving the team. The deal they made is basically as if that never happened.

It's unusual, but the Pelicans owners were agreeable to the arrangement. New Orleans fans don't particularly care about having the Hornets history. There are no titles or anything or real connection.

It doesn't get mentioned much on either broadcast because both fanbases get it. There's nothing to throw a fit about here. These are two young franchises who have yet to reach the top and really build their legacies.

You say you get it but the thing you really don't get is what the Hornets mean to Charlotte. They were a team with consistent sellouts in the 90s. Even in recent years despite being bad their attendance is still pretty good. || As a transplant to Charlotte, there's still such a connection with the city to the 90s teams and players. Dell is hornets commentator, and Muggsy is constantly making appearances around the city. Erasing them from the city would feel so wrong. || I am a 45 year old fan of this franchise, never lived in either city, and this does bother me. My first favorite team had Larry Johnson, Dell Curry etc.  As I’m now a Pels fan, I would love if those guys were included in the franchise records. 

But I realize most people in NOLA don’t care, and the folks in Charlotte are probably happy to have those guys included.  

It’s similar to the Cleveland Browns, in that the original Browns are now the Ravens, but I think the current browns retain all the history || Hell yeah. IMO this is exactly what the sub is about. Idk if I agree or not, but I like your spirit.

I think the franchise record point is actually really interesting, and I never thought about that before || I had this same argument with people at the time of the change. I eventually accepted that it is what it is because people with more influence than me got to make that decision. || >And even though they got those stats for a Charlotte team, you don’t play for a city, you play for a franchise

I think this gets at the crux of the debate. I think if you asked players, they would say they play for, in order, their teammates, their coaches, the fans, and then the management/front office. And if you asked fans, they would say they cheer for the players, then the coaches, then the management/front office. So in both directions, the connection is stronger between city and team as in the product on the floor than between city and team as an organization/entity. That's why Charlotteans deserves to keep Grandmama LJ, Muggsy, Glen Rice, Dell, down through Crash Wallace, Kemba, and now Lamelo. While New Orleanians get to keep CP3, DWest, AD, Zion, BI, etc. And I'm sure if Seattle gets an expansion team they will reclaim the Sonics portions of Thunder history for the same reason. || I honestly agree. It is complete bullshit. It's one thing to change the name, but to take the history. Does that mean that Wizards won the 1948 championship? Because nobody makes this claim. || Some good points. I really do get the Hornets mean a lot to the city, I just find it interesting how the history aspect is gone about. 

Let me use this as an example (although it is not a perfect comparison, I think it will illustrate my point). I’m not sure if you follow the NHL but the Arizona Coyotes were a team through last season and relocated to Utah and are now actually considered a new franchise (an expansion franchise) called the Utah Hockey Club (temporary name, they’re going to get a permanent name next season). But an expansion team is supposed to be a new team that collects players from other teams with a separate expansion draft to form their own team. However, the roster of the Utah team is mostly made up of the Coyotes team of last year (a few changes made in the offseason just like any other team) as well as the same coach etc. 

But this year’s team for them is now considered an expansion team so in future discussions when other teams’ first years are put into conversions over things like who was most successful/least successful in their first year or other things like that, this 2025 Utah team will be in that conversation even though their foundation of players has been around for a few years, not starting this year. 

There are already discussions that Arizona will get a team again and be called the Coyotes. If and when that happens, maybe they will do a similar thing where the new franchise takes back the history of the former Coyotes (now Utah). But that would be kind of dishonest because they are two separate “family trees” as the new roster wouldn’t have any roots from the old roster.

Again, this is not exactly a perfect comparison to the Hornets/Pelicans, but my point is that it’s just funny to me that an organization (not in a fans aspect, but the firings, signings, trades etc. aspect) is allowed “trade their history” and it’s almost like pretending that they don’t know what happened or that they weren’t the ones that made those moves. || I never knew that about the Browns. Wow || As a NOLA native, I agree that the people do not care one bit about the history of the Hornets. We're just glad to have a NBA team to root for and drink to. 

I would be more curious as to how the Supersonics would work if OKC wins this year. || You think it's complete bullshit why? 

Also a big reason is was so easy is that the Hornets are one of the youngest franchises. And they have no titles. 

You can't compare them with a team playing in the 40s || Yeah well the Coyotes were some other team before they were the coyotes.

But let's say they were actually a new team in the 90s, and then this happened, it would be a comparable situation and might make some sense.

The best comparison is actually the Cleveland Browns. They moved and became the Ravens. But the Browns have a deep history with the NFL and the city. So there was a deal worked out where the Ravens were treated like an expansion team and the Browns history was kept in Cleveland even though it was a few years before they got their team back. 

 Hornets were an expansion team and the first major sports franchise in the entire state. Guys like Muggsy and Curry are legends in Charlotte. They don't mean anything to New Orleans. It's just something that makes for all sides. In reality, sports teams aren't so much about the billionaires at the top and all that, it's about the city and the fans that have connections to those teams. || I think if Seattle gets an expansion Sonics they will get all the old history back as well. 

As a side note, I’m very glad they moved to Nola, as I’ve visited several times to see the Pels, and absolutely love it there || Because it's not true. We can all see it. And it's not just the Hornets. This is a recent phenomenon with the Browns or the Earthquakes. They were the Hornets for years after the move, and all of a sudden, they magically became an expansion team. This shit also encourages teams to move because it makes it easy for owners to circumvent expansion regulations and cheap out. Also, teams are teams, and they are not a city. People root for teams outside where they live. Why is this association with cities a thing? Especially since some cities have more than one team. || ""why is this association with cities a thing?""

Because that's how sports are. 

They're not called the Dolan Knicks or the Reinsdorf Bulls.

The geographic connection is why fans invest in and love their teams. To try and downplay this is really misguided. || Sure, but again, it's not a guarantee, and nobody is mandated to do so. I mean, I don't like the MLS because no team interests me. That's not even going into cities that have no team, and we're not blocking them from liking the game. Because we don't own them, we don't have a club system that even grows talent. Should we force people to be fans of the local team? Again, New York and Los Angeles are weird because they have more than one team, and success or failure of one isn't for the other. Fans of these teams don't feel this way, and it's a reason why intracity rivalries exist. We're not here hugging and kissing each other.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.034,0.855,0.111,0.9973,0.069,0.804,0.127,0.9986
Stephen Curry,"""Stephen Curry"" OR ""Chef Curry"" OR ""Steph"" OR ""Curry"" OR ""Stephen""",2025-04-01,nbadiscussion,1joodhd,Everytime I watch old basketball I feel like someone who's being deprogrammed after leaving a cult,"So this whole post was inspired by the Thinking Basketball video on the NBA's YouTube channel regarding the defense of the '04 pistons, particularly during the finals against the Lakers...and I feel like I'm actually insane. Like somehow my YouTube got a different version of the video than everyone else's. 

The more I watched the more I realize that Detroit had such a great defense because they were executing what are considered basic defensive actions today. Switching, pre-rotating, sagging off bad shooters, trapping PnRs, doubling and rotating, big men coming up to the level of the screen ECT. These actions happen hundreds of times in today's NBA, and modern players get lampooned when they don't execute them properly. Yet the world famous, historical Kobe-Shaq Lakers couldn't handle it.

First of all, there was no spacing. It was hilarious to watch the Pistons sag off the perimeter players so much that they were essentially executing a box-and-one for most possessions. Gary Payton passed on multiple open threes, and like lazily passed on them too. He just kept the ball moving seemingly without intent or urgency, which gave Detroit plenty of time to rotate. There were multiple examples of Lakers defenders, including Kobe (who was all-defense first team that year) getting beat badly off the dribble on the perimeter by Chauncey, Rip and even Tayshaun. Oh and there was barely any help behind them. Sometimes the defenders in the paint would take a step in and think about contesting the shot, but usually they just got open layups...in game three of the *finals*.

Shaq was an absolute joke defending the PnR. It almost looked like he already knew he couldn't defend in space so he didn't even bother trying. This is the Shaq that gets paid millions of dollars to talk about rangz™ and shit on modern players on TV? Correct me if I'm wrong but Chauncey isn't some once in a generation athlete, and all he needed was one screen to make Shaq look like me at the Y. 

I think the Monty Williams Pistons had a more complex offensive system than the Lakers in the video I watched. Seriously, the would take ten seconds to execute one simple play and if that didn't work they gave the ball to Shaq or Kobe and stood around for the rest of the possession. The sheer lack of movement and intensity was astonishing. No wonder players got injured so much less back then, they spent half the game not moving. 

There was one play where number 3 on the Lakers (Devin George? I don't care) passed to Karl in the post from the corner then immediately cuts to the rim. Karl passes him the ball back, and George went in for the layup. The problem was **he drove directly into Rasheed Wallace** who, having just been guarding Karl in the post, needed to literally take one step over to block the shot. 

There was another play where Kobe gets the ball in the corner and gets around Tayshaun. The problem is the Lakers spacing is so bad that the other four pistons are literally each standing in one of the corners of the paint. There are three wide open Lakers, including first ballot hall of famers Gary Payton and creepy uncle Karl, just standing around twenty feet from the hoop. Chauncey doesn't have to move to help on the Kobe drive, Kobe tries to force a pass to Shaq (literally his only teammate that isn't open) and it practically hits Ben Wallace in the face and goes out of bounds. 

Finally (I could sit here for hours and dissect the Lakers offense possession by possession, but I'm capping myself at three examples) there was a play where George gets doubled at half court as he's bringing the ball up. I should put doubled in sarcastic quotations because it was the slowest double I've ever seen. There are two Detroit defenders, each about seven feet away from George, and they're about to double him. George has a full three seconds to hold the ball and think *before he dribbles directly into the double team.* Pistons swarm, ball gets knocked out of bounds. A starter on the lauded 03-04 Lakers team was so discombobulated by the idea of a trap at half court that he takes a deep breath, checks the wind, then tries to dribble through it instead of pass to the two other Lakers who were with him in the backcourt. It's truly unbelievable. 

What's really upsetting is the comments are absolutely orgasming to this footage. Literally people talking about how this Pistons defense is a work of art and how modern teams (who execute this type of defense practically every day) could never compare to this kind of basketball. Somebody literally said the 05 Pistons and the 05 Spurs that went to the finals the following year were the best defensive teams ever. He actually emphasized the ever. I couldn't believe we were watching the same footage. It's unfathomable. 

But most upsetting was knowing I was watching the legends of the sport. ""Mamba Mentality"" ""12 time all defense"" Kobe getting beaten so badly on the perimeter that he's barely moved his feet before the guy is passed him. Shaq and Karl repeatedly just jogging back on defense, often allowing open shots in the process. Karl and Payton just standing around in offense on multiple occasions. Nobody, and I do mean nobody, rotating to help defend the rim even though the spacing was so bad they were already in the paint. The Lakers not actually starting their offense until 14 seconds left on the shot clock, and completely panicking when the first action doesn't work. 

These are the legends that I keep hearing about? These are the guys that go on TV and shit on the modern game constantly? These are the heroes of the modern players in the league that I love now? These are the players that were winning awards every year? This is how they play in one of the biggest games of their time? It's embarrassing. Idk how anyone can watch that and try to tell me with a straight face that it's better basketball. 

Has anyone seen the video I'm talking about? Am I crazy? Please tell me that I'm not alone, because if one more person tells me that Lakers team would beat the Steph-KD Warriors in a seven game series I'm going to set something on fire 💀

Also here's the video in case anyone wants to see it

Edit 2: just to be clear, my main point of this post was to criticize the people who constantly shit on the modern game while telling me the old game was better. I understand how and why the game has evolved, and that comparing players from 20 years ago to modern players is a bit unfair. I just hear so much praise for old basketball that when I saw these legendary teams I was taken aback at their performance. I see now that I could have communicated that better. ",3317,756,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1joodhd/everytime_i_watch_old_basketball_i_feel_like/,2025-04-01 01:41:58,"Zone defense had only become legal in 01-02 so the execution by the pistons was not something the lakers were familiar with as not every team had embraced it yet. Larry Brown was really a pioneer in modern defense. 

And what you are describing of the lakers offense is the triangle, it’s why no one runs it anymore. The glove and Malone were a bad fit in the offense just in general, they are both all time pick and roll players, which the triangle is the opposite of, and it notoriously took players 2-3 seasons to “figure out” Jackson’s triangle offense. Taking threes from the top of the arc was sacrilege in Jackson’s offense. And GP was the 4th scoring option on that team which basically meant “don’t shoot” to Phil Jackson. Kobe notoriously tried to play hardcore hero ball in that series to the point that it irrevocably broke up the Shaq Kobe duo, so I’m guessing GP wasn’t feeling like going rogue in that series. || Over the years there have been many advancements to the coaching and to the strategy of the game. Year by year incremental changes have added up and game play has significantly progressed.    
That being said, as someone who watched those games in real time and is still watching today, everything you said is both true and fucking hilarious. || It’s the biggest thing people miss when they talk about how everyone just misses games now. It’s a lot easier to play basketball when you’re mostly just running back and forth from paint to paint. Nowadays guys might have to cover a player just past half court, shuffle with him on a drive, x out to cover a shooter in the corner and then go help in the paint all in a matter of seconds. It’s a huge strain on the body to change speeds and directions that quickly and frequently 

I haven’t seen the video you’re mentioning but I’ll check it out, I always find it striking how much the league has evolved in such a short time || I was a huge sports fan growing up, particularly from 95-06. I slowly dipped out of sports viewing as a hobby until stopping cold in 2010. During that specific period, my family and I watched the entirety of games almost every single day of the week. We were also Mavs fans, so I definitely saw the lows of the NBA as much as anything else.


I randomly got back into Basketball last year, and holy moly. This is almost a different league of sport with the amount of skill jump there's been.


People get caught up on highlight reel, playoff time moments of a lot of older players and teams - but day to day most would not be considered very good if they time travelled to play now. || People are going to favor the era of a game they first liked or played. Obviously the game has evolved past what it was 20 years ago but you also don't get to this point without the success in previous era's.


It gets talked about all the time because it's a stupid argument that drives engagement from people that can't breathe out of their nose. || I recently watched the 4th quarter of the Lakers-Mavs game from early 2000s on YouTube, where the Lakers make a historic comeback. I was also struck by how overwhelming the sentiment in the comments was about how that was the best and most entertaining era of basketball. 

My sense is that while it's objectively true the game is more skilled and complex, I think it has crossed some threshold to where that skill and complexity has genuinely made the sport less entertaining and harder to follow for the average viewer. Stuff like big man post-ups are in contrast an easy to follow one-on-one battle that involves a matchup of strength and footwork. 

From the actual game I think the thing that most stood out to me more than anything that was happening on the court was how engaged the crowd seemed to be despite the home team being down big because this was pre-smartphones. || There's a lot of things that factors into why it was as slow and ""physical"" as it was then. For one, zone defense wasn't even allowed until not that long before this Finals. People then definitely weren't geared to shoot, so that simplified the game so much more than what it is today, not to mention, positionless basketball was not even remotely a thing yet; it was way beyond the horizon. But you're 1000% right though, I mean, teams today would run a train through most of the teams of the past, and the Shaq & Kobe Lakers were def a legendary team too. People talk about physicality that modern teams wouldn't be able to handle, and that's a fair point, but they always say shit like that as if there's nothing to exploit about old school basketball in a match up against the modern era and that physicality will trump everything.

Fact of the matter is, If any team in the past, and I'd dare say even the 96-97 Bulls had to chase Steph's energizer bunny ass all game long, because he gave up the ball to Dray then get hit with down screens after down screens, after down screens, see him set a screen as the PG, for the 3 before zipping out to the corner off a dribble hand-off for a wild off balance corner pocket 3 (or more realistically if they played him in the first year, probably a wide open 3 since they'd have no idea how to chase him nor could they keep up with his motor), then proceed to watch him nail a 40 footer in the next possession when he's on the ball? I've said this to my friend a few times, but they'd have Steph tied to a stake and burned alive underneath the jumbotrons before he ever got to play a second game if he time traveled back to any time period before the mid 2000s. Because that shit's gotta be witchcraft given the state of the league then. The types of actions, the constant passing, drive and kick, flare / ghost screens, 4 on 3 basketball with wide open lanes or wide open 3s would make their fucking heads spin. Look no further than 2014-2015 thru 2015-2016 Golden State and specifically Steph absolutely terrorizing an entire league every single game on the way to a 73-9 season. Minus the Finals meltdown, I had never seen the league look so lost on defense because they had never seen let alone been prepped to deal with anything like him before. 20-25 pt leads were being evaporated by that Golden State team. The Hampton 5 line up was putting up 50+ pt quarters demolishing teams before it even got to half time. Those shots that used to get your ass benched for even thinking about? Steph was and still is capable of sinking them from logo distance over double teams. He pushed the league to its absolute limit and opened the door to all the possibilities of the game and that forced everyone to play ball or get left behind in the dust. Today's basketball is a product of constant movement and generating the highest level of advantage possible through spacing. A lot of the plays that the 04' Finals Lakers and Pistons couldn't efficiently execute? We got wrinkles in those plays now in the modern game and that puts the modern game far ahead of the past. What's that called? Oh yeah, evolution. It's only natural. Once defense was able to catch up with how to defend the plays, the game got even more entertaining imo. Players and teams have to play more pinpoint, precise defense than ever before, and that in my honest opinion, takes way more skill than to have to hack someone everytime because it's a sign that you can't keep up and have to resort to fucking someone up just to get a stop. That's also defense evolving to be more skill oriented.

HOWEVER, I am a believer that the rules are still far too in favor of the offense nowadays, and would like, at least for the NBA to stay consistent in calling the rules as they had changed it a few years ago to prevent players from jumping into other players for fouls. In fact that specific call in favor of the offense, I had seen so many times from Kobe and Wade when I was watching them as I was growing up. Only difference was/is in the modern game, that quite a few players don't even bother making the shot and just flop around to get the call.

But at the end of the day, the old heads, the old school way of basketball was there for a reason. They're lessons, and they paved the way for what is possible today. Afterall, Steph is a blend of Reggie Miller, Rip Hamilton; even he had people to look up to before he was bombing away from everywhere within half court. || While I understand your off hand dismissals of Chauncy and Tayshaun, you might not understand how good both of these guys were playing at the time. Chauncy may not be a once in lifetime athelete, but he was ultra skilled and was known to break teams. His collection of skills, his leadership, and his reputation helped make Detroit into a team that other teams feared. Tayshaun played well for a couple of years, gaurding the best offensive option on the other team and generally using his length well on offense. Tayshaun was in the olympics and got a gold medal. That 2004 team won as a team and every player had moments in their run. Tayshaun was as important as Rasheed and Ben, and don't even get me started on the innovative play of Richard Hamilton. His DNA is all over the modern NBA. || You're experiencing a basketball version of the Seinfeld isn't funny trope.  You're not entirely wrong, but you are standing on top of a ladder looking 20 years down and wondering why those idiots didn't just keep climbing. || This is an eras thing. Go and watch the Ravens play the best defense ever in the 2000’s it’s the same thing. They would be destroyed by almost any NFL offense right now. What’s you’re saying is completely accurate. It’s just that coaching and analytics have changed almost every sport. Go watch the whole games from the 97-98 Bulls games how they defend the PnR is hilarious, under every screen, no hedging or switching it’s so basic. This against “the best pick and role duo ever” in Stockton and Malone and yeah the old heads are insane. It’s so much harder to play defense. The amount of effort and communication required for modern defenses is night and day. || I'm a Pistons fan, so obviously the 2004 team is incredibly special to me. But I'm also very much not deluded into thinking that the 2003-04 Lakers were the same as even the 2001-02 Lakers. They were carried by the talent of Kobe and sheer dominance of Shaq, and when those two were working together, they beat anyone. To some level, I've always suspected Lakers (but more specifically, Kobe fans) need the 2004 Pistons to have a mythic aurora about them to mask a truth that was clear in this series: Kobe's selfishness cost them this series, and he fell right into the Pistons game plan.

But the Pistons were also no scrubs, either. They were arguably the first team to run a ""modern"" line-up with four guys who could shoot, and the one guy who couldn't shoot was an absolute defensive monster and elite rebounder. They would still match up well with any of the current teams, and to echo what others have said, I prefer the game when every bucket feels important and hard-fought.

I get excited by insane deep threes and circus lay-ups as much as anyone while also attributing outsized importance to the midrange jumper. But to me, I think the loss of allowable physicality is a loss for the game itself. Rewarding offensive players for initiating contact cheapens points, and de-incentivizing that aspect of the game would do wonders for watchability. || I think watching eras you're not familiar with is difficult, and if you're like me, it's also not the same when it's not live.   I'm not saying any era I've watched is better than any other era though.   They all have specific feel to them, much different variables, there's certain things that make each one special, this current one is no different.  The bar gets set, and we watch players raise that bar beyond what we thought it could be and we all fall in love. The era's change but the viewing experience is honestly similar.

When I was younger in the 90s, I used to go online and talk shit about 60s/70s basketball to old heads, so I totally get where younger people are coming from. They would tell us the same nonsense you hear today. It's just an old head thing. 

If you teleported the 96 bulls into a game today, they'd most likely get wrecked.  If they grew up in this era though, I'm positive some of them would still be in the NBA doing crazy things.  That doesn't necessarily make this era better from a viewer standpoint though, just different.  Some people enjoyed the dead ball era because scoring was difficult and games felt more like a chess match.  

For me personally, the highs of this era are my favorite and the lows are some of the worst. I do feel players/teams used to take the regular season more seriously, many regular season games were just as intense as playoff games. || I feel like people underrate how massively NBA coaching staffs have figured out every ounce of an advantage possible through 70+ years of basketball tape.


Of course every team will be aware and utilize the schemes of the most famous defensive unit in NBA history. Plus the will use every other defensive resource both in NBAs history and from every other league.


The same thing happened to the 2016 Warriors. They cracked a sort of offensive code and soon after, every team figured out how to use movement and the 3 ball. 


It's like that gif showing the difference between gymnastic eras. || The problem with all this “awareness” is that you omit the reality that players don’t just get to go rogue. You play based on what you’re coached to do. So the notion that a style of play is inherently a function of player skill or lack thereof is a silly statement to make. If Steph Curry existed in the 90s, he wouldn’t have gotten carte blanche to shoot 3’s. KD wouldve been asked to post up with his back to the basket. 

Now, assume players have had these things normalized the way the game has basically flipped to a jump shooting contest the last 15 years. You still assume a Shaq who played in that situation would be “useless” (he dropped a 36/20 in the most important game of the series and got let down by Kobe going 8/25)? LeBron shot 44/27/73 vs a lesser version of that team in the 2006 playoffs and is now ultra efficient. So was he overrated, or MAYBE, was defense simply more prioritized and allowed during the aughts? || Playing d is a lot harder when you have to guard 4-5 3 pt threats at all times and offenses designed to create open threes or use the threat to open up cuts. Plus rule changes. 

Anyone saying ""no one plays d"" acts like players, nevermind coaches and GMS, don't realize it's half the game and only care about fantasy league stats. Instead of winning and keeping their jobs. || Talking about how good the defense used to be is a clear sign of someone who genuinely has not watched the NBA for a long time. Defense in general is sooo much better today than it used to be. || You can’t directly compare the modern game with previous generations. Everything should be graded relative to the era. Eras build on each other.

The Steph KD Warriors would not be the same in 2004. Steph and KD themselves would not be the same. The Lakers would not be operating the same in the modern era. Kobe and Shaq would have more sophisticated games.

You wouldn’t look at chess masters in the 1800s and say wow, those guys are terrible, what were they thinking? Knowledge and best practices evolve. || That’s like looking back on Dan Marino and being like his arm isn’t so great. The teams and players that redefine how we play the game are the greats, and yea everyone then goes and tries to copy the greats || It was a weird in-between period, after the zone defense rules changed, but before the hand check rules changed. So I think that makes it difficult to compare to today. Teams were still figuring out how to attack the zone.   

Also,  you might want to watch some random non Finals game from that season just for comparison. Please share if you do. || People who bash the modern game are annoying and wrong but you're doing the opposite which is equally annoying and wrong. Both the past and present greats should be appreciated for what they are instead of viewing through the lens of constant comparison. Early 00s basketball was great and your dismissing how awesome that series was by only engaging it through comparison instead of just enjoying what you are watching. || There's a perfect test case to consider how players and the game have evolved - LeBron James. He played in this era of the league when he was drafted in 2004 at 18 years old, and he's still dominating in a completely new era of the league at 40 years old. Anyone comparing the two eras would normally be hyperbolic and say ""a young LeBron would put up 75 ppg in that era of the NBA!"" and they would be wrong because we saw what he did, just like an old head saying LeBron couldn't play in their era would be wrong because we saw what he did. You can make the same argument for Chris Paul. Another example is a dude like Jason Kidd - in his prime, he was a terrible three point shooter. His nickname was Ason because he had no J. Fast forward to the league prioritizing the three point shot, and he got his 3P% up to the low 40s range. These arguments always fall apart when you ignore all the players who bridged two eras and show how guys can evolve with the game. Players who are good now would have been good back then, and players who were good back then would be good now. The rules and the context in which the game is played has completely changed, and the players evolve their skillsets to match what was prioritized at the time. If Wemby played in that era, he would be 100lbs heavier and his ass would be parked down at the block. Context matters. || That era is known as the dead ball era for a reason. Yes, for today’s NBA the defense wouldn’t hold up, but for that time it was revolutionary. That Pistons style defense completely changed the league for the better. Without it we’d still be watching guys who shouldn’t be ISO’ing doing it 100 times a game anyway. The game was unsophisticated because it didn’t have to be complex to work until the rule changes. Once the ISO era offenses got beat to death, we started slowly moving towards what we have now. So yeah, the game is way better now but specifically because it was so bad from 2000-2009. I’m glad you have fought through the brainwashing || Defense takes effort and that team is historically the best defensive championship winning team they held there opponents to under 90 points that whole playoff and finals series . That Detroit team would have won back to back if there wasn’t that all time great team the San Antonio Spurs . || So the team and the coach who pioneered many of the things that make NBA defenses so good today were bad? || OP, you’re not crazy. Modern NBA media commentary is mostly just hate-slinging for impressions and attention. Hilariously, or ironically, guys like Kenny and Barkley put as much effort into their basketball “analysis” as those Lakers put into defense lol. It’s infuriating as a Timberwolves fan especially. Last year we’d be folding teams left and right, and I’d turn on NBA Today to see 20 min of heated discussion about Golden State and the Lakers who were like the 8 and 10-seeds at the time. These networks know who butters their bread and they’re happy to generate viewership by farming outrage from big markets instead of doing actual sports journalism. || I agree with pretty much all of your points, but I think you're doing the video a bit of a disservice, as the guy doing voiceover basically explains all of this. He explains that it was a different era of basketball, that taking a contested two-pointer as a star was considered better than an open three, that the Lakers lineup had major weaknesses that the Pistons exploited, etc. I'm no basketball expert but I do know that getting mad about internet comments is almost never a good idea, those people don't actually care about basketball in the way you do and their opinions can be safely disregarded. As far as the '04 Pistons themselves, from what I can tell, it seems that they inspired other teams to use their defensive techniques, making them quite influential, which is one of the greatest achievements a team can have. The fact that they won a championship doing it makes it all the sweeter || This is a very interesting discussion to have and you're right on some levels, but you're also missing some context. There's a reason that 04 Lakers team lost the Finals. That wasn't the vaunted legendary Lakers team you're thinking of, that everybody celebrates. 

The 04 team was already a far cry from the all time great 2000 to 2002 team that won a 3peat. There were many issues, and some of these may or may not sound just like excuses to you:

- It was a team that was past its prime as a unit. It didn't have the same chemistry because half of its players were new to the team and weren't the same ones from the 3peat. 

- Karl Malone and Gary Payton, who were great in the 90s, were old and washed up by 04, plus they were newly added to the team that year as a desperation move to try and bounce back after not making the Finals the previous season.

- Shaq and Kobe famously were feuding with each other and went their seperate ways right after.

Multiple times u mentioned Shaq and Malone's slowness and inability to defend in space. Shaq was close to 400 pounds by then so of course he wasn't quick or agile on defense, like you very much noticed. Karl Malone was pretty heavy himself, plus he was 41 years old by then, so way past his athletic prime (he used to average like 30+ in the 97 and 98 Finals) and he barely scored at all in this series.

When there's no chemistry or cohesion, it's hard to play team defense or get guys to really commit to playing the right way, plus there was no hunger for a championship anymore for most of those guys who had been there and done that already. They all probably just wanted to get it over with, although that's not a valid excuse for half passing your way through the NBA Finals.

So the team u saw wasn't the world beating team that blew through the league a few seasons prior and I hope these things might explain some of the deficiencies you saw. I'm sure there's more to it too that others can add. There's probably other things I could say too, but its the morning for me and I gotta get ready to go to work. Probably shouldn't have spent so much time on this just now lol. || One of the things that’s shit about modern NBA is the homogeneous nature of play. Everyone looks the same. 

Second the lack of time protection. Watching Jordan, Starks, Nique, get up and absolutely cram on someone is better than watching some one hit a 3 on a defender closing out or worse yet doing a run out. 

Watching actual post play vs a double team is better than watching a fucking shooting clinic. 

Sure the athletes aren’t as athletic or as skilled shooters but on the other hand post play was better and point guards were better. 

Watching fast breaks was also more enjoyable with guys cutting to the hoops vs running to the corners || > The more I watched the more I realize that Detroit had such a great defense because they were executing what are considered basic defensive actions today.

Yeah, that makes sense to me. Detroit wasn't a great defensive team because of complex schemes, they were a great defensive because everybody on the floor was a good if not great defender (Rip Hamilton was the only starter who wasn't playing D at a borderline all-defense-team level and he was still an above average perimeter stopper) and because they had great chemistry and teamwork - everybody had everybody's back, nobody cared who got the credit, if there was blame then they kept the finger-pointing in the locker room, everyone gave their full effort night after night. 

> because if one more person tells me that Lakers team would beat the Steph-KD Warriors in a seven game series

Well to be fair, they're probably thinking of the 2001 Lakers playoff run which was their preak, not the 2004 Lakers that were feuding and sniping at each other. That said I still think the Steph/KD Warriors win because of the sheer talent. It'd be like taking the 2001 Lakers and then adding Kidd, Duncan, or Garnett to the squad.

> ""12 time all defense"" Kobe getting beaten so badly on the perimeter that he's barely moved his feet

This is some great evidence that Kobe got way too many of those awards. Aside from maybe 2000 and 2001 he had his highlight locked-in moments and could defend well at those times - but he wasn't like that game-in and game-out. Nobody in league history has a higher ratio of All-Defensive Teams / Actual Eliteness as a Defender.  Looking at his awards you'd think he'd be up there as an all-time perimeter stopper like you see from the primes of Scottie Pippen, Joe Dumars, Gary Payton, Tony Allen, Bruce Bowen, Shane Battier, Kawhi Leonard, Ron Artest, etc, but he just wasn't *that* good on a typical night. || Its not that deep. You should watch this video. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=E4H\_qxksBFA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=E4H_qxksBFA) 

Basically the three ball in today's era means that defenses and offenses look a lot different and prioritize getting open looks from there and conversely taking those looks away. The 04 lakers and the pistons defensive schemes for them would look a lot different if the lakers had multiple great 3 point shooters like teams have today. But they didn't; so you had a lot less switching and more players in the paint to take away rim drives and mid range jumpers. While Modern nba schemes have advanced, the criticisms you're levying have more to do with the fact that the lakers triangle offense had players that frankly didn't suit them very well. The pistons offense that same series had a lot of the off ball movement that you criticized the lakers for.

I am no mathematician and I do not know much about statistics, so I just decided to take some time and find the answer to the easiest question:

This was more for my personal curiosity. I do not claim that this method actually has any validity or importance, but I did the work so I thought I would share.

**METHOD:**

*stats collected on 4/3*

To do this I referenced the 8 following advanced metrics that I see commonly used:

I decided to include both EPM and EW because I think EPM is the best advanced metric so I wanted to give it some extra weight.

In order to compile the list of players best deserving of All-NBA recognition, I first went through each advanced metric for this season and gave each player a tally for an appearance in the top 20 in each of the stats.

I ended up with a list of 23 players who appeared in the top 20 in >3 out of the 8 stats, who are also likely to meet the 65 games played requirement. I had a few players that surprised me, but generally speaking it aligned with my preconceived idea of who was in contention for All-NBA recognition so I decided to roll with it. The only notable omission was Cade Cunningham who appeared in the top 20 in only 2 out of the 8 advanced metrics. Due to his narrative and likelihood of achieving All-NBA recognition, I included him.

In the following table, I list each player with each of their respective RANKS in each advanced metric. This is not the metric itself, it is just the RANK in which their metric lies in comparison to their peers. 14 in the table means the 14th best number in the league for that respective stat.

At the end of the table, I include two averages. The first average is their average rank across all 8 advanced metrics. The second average (AVG(IMP)) is their average rank across the 5 all around impact metrics (EPM, EW, RAPTOR WAR, LEBRON WAR, and DARKO DPM). I believe these metrics to be different in kind to the others, so I wanted to see their averages separately.

**NOTES**

\-Haliburton being so loved by advanced metrics definitely surprised me given the narrative about him earlier this season. I would be curious to see his metrics if he can put together a full season of consistent play. Advanced metrics understandably love you if you push pace, generate great looks, and rarely turn the ball over.

\-Derrick White being so beloved by advanced metrics was not necessarily surprising, but the fact that it was enough to rank top 15 in this group of players is impressive. He is the epitome of a winning player.

\-While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated. I believe he deserves a lot more love for his performance this season(DPOY anyone?).

\-LeBron, JJJ, Brunson, and Cade not ranking well is definitely not what I expected going into this. Most of the conversation around these players land them in Second Team at worst and I have even heard arguments around these players to claim the 5th First Team spot.

(Looking to see how EW calculated…) || Man Zubac is awesome, eye test tells me he's a great center -- but I still think there is some black box of these stats where they are giving what a center does more weight than other positions. 

Halli is officially super underrated, and Tatum/White, way more than Brown, Jrue, KP, etc. etc. etc. are why Cs had another dominant regular season. (Does your measure like Kornet more than JB? I bet it does.) || [deleted] || Yo this is great. I've idly thought about doing this but was always too lazy, so thanks for the effortpost.

**Edited** to mention their extremely great health this season has a lot to do with it as they're all eligible for these honors. || I did that a while back and was really surprised how each metrics have their clear bias baked in yet top 4, r guys seem to be all unanimous. Like EPM favors offensive usage, LEBRON favors players that fit well into winning teams, DARKO really favors establish stats, etc. but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context. These metrics are really helpful to find out underrated role players, but for stars, they can be extremely misleading. || It’s crazy that the Cavs best player isn’t even one of the 4 in this analysis  || Very interesting perspective, thank you for sharing!

Zubac is a beast || Interesting stuff. Thanks for gathering this data and breaking it all down. Unfortunately, I think you're right that due to media narrative, there is no chance Brunson and LeBron get left off, and it's likely that Cade and JJJ will make it. Although those guys have all had very good seasons so it's not like it will be a travesty for any one of them to get the nod.

Zubac has almost no chance, as deserving as he is (I've been very impressed with him in the few clippers games I've watched this year) and White and Allen will likely miss the cut. I'd love to see Allen make it. The guy is such a great two way player and he's so unselfish on offense. He really makes the Cavs a much better team. || Jarrett Allen and Ivica Zubac ranking #3 and #4 in win shares is an indictment of that statistic.

> While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated.

I agree with the first part of your statement. But given that reality, why are you then trying to use these insignificant statistics to draw conclusions?

Zubac and Allen have roles to play and they play them well, but role players don't deserve to be ranked ahead of guys like Brunson or Cunningham who have far more difficult burdens to carry. || Why would you base it off metrics nobody uses?

Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil.  They’re useless.  

Obviously this isn’t how the teams are selected.  

Harden hasn’t made an all nba team in 5 years and he’s not going to make one over LeBron, who was the February player of the month and 5th on mvp ladder. || [removed] || Ultimately, the players are very close in a lot of these metrics so one good game or bad game down the stretch could vastly change the calculus for this analysis. 

  
For example, Ant had a good game last night and EW updated so now Ant is up from #10 all the way to #5. This alone would likely push Ant firmly into second team if I were to re run the analysis. But as of 4/3, these were the rankings. || Before Kawhi started playing like Kawhi, I thought Zubac was easily the most important Clipper. And for a team that was projected to be a lottery team to have a shot at 50-wins, that's Hella impressive || PER notoriously overweighs rebounding, so bigs pretty much always have higher PER than guards of similar quality. TBH it's a very flawed advanced stat that shouldnt be included in any analysis including this one imo. || The hate towards him was crazy. The people that were saying that haven't actually watched him play in a meaningful amount. He is the best pure creator in the league, hands down. His three point shooting, while streaky at times, is upper echelon. His defense is improving significantly as he gets more experience. He has moved to being a solidly average defender, when he was often a genuine liability in the past.

He still catches hate from people who like to make similar arguments against him that people do for John Stockton. It's baffling to me that people attempt to make straight faced arguments against these players because they make a high volume of ""easy assists"". You are seriously going to hold it against a player because they are capable of coordinating an offense so effectively, that they are able to very consistently get good shooters open shots, in spots that they shoot particularly well from? That is a testament to their ability as a creator, not a detrimental attribute. || The irony about the ""one good month"" thing is that it's really one bad month that tricked people. He was All-NBA last year and will likely be again this year. He had a bad start to the year but is putting up historically efficient numbers. It's basically him and prime CP3 in terms of this combination of scoring and assist volume + efficiency. Nobody else in NBA history has done this. || It’s the same story around the current MVP debate. For a huge amount of NBA fans, box score is the only value you bring to a team. Offensive output, advanced metrics, film, team success, none of it matters compared to that box score that you can glance at for five seconds and determine how valuable a player is. || The reality is that Allen not being worthy of an all-star this year is mostly a numbers thing, getting four players in is pretty ridiculous given how much talent there is around the league. But having watched most of our games this year, I think it's debatable that he's even our fourth-best player, especially if you consider his defensive impact. He's also the type of player to be underrated by casual/occasional viewers, because he does a lot that doesn't show up on the scoreboard. || >but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context.

Do these metrics underrate these players or are you just over rating them? 

Harden, Herro, and Cade all have good advanced stats. They all carry fairly poor offences || Yes, the biggest reason for this is that none of these stats measure on-ball defensive attention drawn and the benefits that it leads to for other players on the team at the risk of deflating counting stats of the player drawing the attention.

Making open looks as the 3rd/4th option on your team and ending up with a high TS% does not make a player better than say a Cade Cunningham or Donovan Mitchell.

It’s similar to how Ayton had distinctly better advanced numbers than Luka in their rookie seasons along with strong box score numbers at incredible efficiency yet anyone watching knew he was Ayton was a play finisher role player on a fully firing suns team and Luka was the entire Mavs offence. || 2025 is certainly the year of our Lord Tyrone Jerome. || What makes Zubac a role player? He's averaging 17 and 13 playing 33 MPG while anchoring the Clippers' defense. He's contending for the most important player on the team right next to Harden and Kawhi. || > Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil. They’re useless.
> 
> 

Publicly available defensive metrics, absolutely. There's basically zero value in those.

Publicly available overall metrics are solid. The vast majority of basketball value comes from offense and we can measure most of that. It's imperfect, but it's a very good way to determine who's in the ballpark. || My understanding is a lot of these stats weigh a bunch of counting stats heavier for centers than other roles -- which is OK up to a point because maybe a center getting an assist is more valuable than a PG doing the same, but it's hard to know. PER people who know seem to generally perceive as antiquated, right? || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || As someone who doesn't watch much Indiana or Charlotte basketball,  I'm really curious how Haliburton and Ball compare now. And to a lesser extent, Ant.  
Thinking back, man, that was a really fun draft class. || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || It's so weird, he was an all-star and top-tier playmaker an entire year on the Pacers in 22-23 season. His second half of the season in 21-22, when he was traded to the Pacers, was also really really good. His shooting averages have been good his entire career. ""One good month"" people are trolls or need to have their eyes checked because all you need to do is watch 48 minutes of the Pacers and you'll see him constantly trapped and doubled _at the logo_ and instead of playing hero ball he swings it because someone will be open, whether it counts in his box score or not.

But it's no surprise, average basketball fans are really really stupid when it comes to elite playmakers. Jokic was clowned for years and now pretty much everyone recognize how incredible he is. I wonder, what is the difference between now and years before? Ring finger, that's it. || Wouldn't models that include plus/minus stats account for this?

**NOTES**

\-Haliburton being so loved by advanced metrics definitely surprised me given the narrative about him earlier this season. I would be curious to see his metrics if he can put together a full season of consistent play. Advanced metrics understandably love you if you push pace, generate great looks, and rarely turn the ball over.

\-Derrick White being so beloved by advanced metrics was not necessarily surprising, but the fact that it was enough to rank top 15 in this group of players is impressive. He is the epitome of a winning player.

\-While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated. I believe he deserves a lot more love for his performance this season(DPOY anyone?).

\-LeBron, JJJ, Brunson, and Cade not ranking well is definitely not what I expected going into this. Most of the conversation around these players land them in Second Team at worst and I have even heard arguments around these players to claim the 5th First Team spot.

This likely means nothing to most people, but there may be a few sickos who find this interesting.",293,44,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jrdwn9/202425_allnba_teams_based_on_average_ranking/,2025-04-04 10:56:58,"I have long thought Zubac criminally underrated but this HAS to be the most surprising result.

**Edited** to mention their extremely great health this season has a lot to do with it as they're all eligible for these honors. || I did that a while back and was really surprised how each metrics have their clear bias baked in yet top 4, r guys seem to be all unanimous. Like EPM favors offensive usage, LEBRON favors players that fit well into winning teams, DARKO really favors establish stats, etc. but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context. These metrics are really helpful to find out underrated role players, but for stars, they can be extremely misleading. || It’s crazy that the Cavs best player isn’t even one of the 4 in this analysis  || Very interesting perspective, thank you for sharing!

Zubac is a beast || Interesting stuff. Thanks for gathering this data and breaking it all down. Unfortunately, I think you're right that due to media narrative, there is no chance Brunson and LeBron get left off, and it's likely that Cade and JJJ will make it. Although those guys have all had very good seasons so it's not like it will be a travesty for any one of them to get the nod.

Zubac has almost no chance, as deserving as he is (I've been very impressed with him in the few clippers games I've watched this year) and White and Allen will likely miss the cut. I'd love to see Allen make it. The guy is such a great two way player and he's so unselfish on offense. He really makes the Cavs a much better team. || Jarrett Allen and Ivica Zubac ranking #3 and #4 in win shares is an indictment of that statistic.

> While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated.

I agree with the first part of your statement. But given that reality, why are you then trying to use these insignificant statistics to draw conclusions?

Zubac and Allen have roles to play and they play them well, but role players don't deserve to be ranked ahead of guys like Brunson or Cunningham who have far more difficult burdens to carry. || Why would you base it off metrics nobody uses?

Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil.  They’re useless.  

Obviously this isn’t how the teams are selected.  

Harden hasn’t made an all nba team in 5 years and he’s not going to make one over LeBron, who was the February player of the month and 5th on mvp ladder. || [removed] || Ultimately, the players are very close in a lot of these metrics so one good game or bad game down the stretch could vastly change the calculus for this analysis. 

  
For example, Ant had a good game last night and EW updated so now Ant is up from #10 all the way to #5. This alone would likely push Ant firmly into second team if I were to re run the analysis. But as of 4/3, these were the rankings. || Before Kawhi started playing like Kawhi, I thought Zubac was easily the most important Clipper. And for a team that was projected to be a lottery team to have a shot at 50-wins, that's Hella impressive || PER notoriously overweighs rebounding, so bigs pretty much always have higher PER than guards of similar quality. TBH it's a very flawed advanced stat that shouldnt be included in any analysis including this one imo. || The hate towards him was crazy. The people that were saying that haven't actually watched him play in a meaningful amount. He is the best pure creator in the league, hands down. His three point shooting, while streaky at times, is upper echelon. His defense is improving significantly as he gets more experience. He has moved to being a solidly average defender, when he was often a genuine liability in the past.

He still catches hate from people who like to make similar arguments against him that people do for John Stockton. It's baffling to me that people attempt to make straight faced arguments against these players because they make a high volume of ""easy assists"". You are seriously going to hold it against a player because they are capable of coordinating an offense so effectively, that they are able to very consistently get good shooters open shots, in spots that they shoot particularly well from? That is a testament to their ability as a creator, not a detrimental attribute. || The irony about the ""one good month"" thing is that it's really one bad month that tricked people. He was All-NBA last year and will likely be again this year. He had a bad start to the year but is putting up historically efficient numbers. It's basically him and prime CP3 in terms of this combination of scoring and assist volume + efficiency. Nobody else in NBA history has done this. || It’s the same story around the current MVP debate. For a huge amount of NBA fans, box score is the only value you bring to a team. Offensive output, advanced metrics, film, team success, none of it matters compared to that box score that you can glance at for five seconds and determine how valuable a player is. || The reality is that Allen not being worthy of an all-star this year is mostly a numbers thing, getting four players in is pretty ridiculous given how much talent there is around the league. But having watched most of our games this year, I think it's debatable that he's even our fourth-best player, especially if you consider his defensive impact. He's also the type of player to be underrated by casual/occasional viewers, because he does a lot that doesn't show up on the scoreboard. || >but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context.

Do these metrics underrate these players or are you just over rating them? 

Harden, Herro, and Cade all have good advanced stats. They all carry fairly poor offences || Yes, the biggest reason for this is that none of these stats measure on-ball defensive attention drawn and the benefits that it leads to for other players on the team at the risk of deflating counting stats of the player drawing the attention.

Making open looks as the 3rd/4th option on your team and ending up with a high TS% does not make a player better than say a Cade Cunningham or Donovan Mitchell.

It’s similar to how Ayton had distinctly better advanced numbers than Luka in their rookie seasons along with strong box score numbers at incredible efficiency yet anyone watching knew he was Ayton was a play finisher role player on a fully firing suns team and Luka was the entire Mavs offence. || 2025 is certainly the year of our Lord Tyrone Jerome. || What makes Zubac a role player? He's averaging 17 and 13 playing 33 MPG while anchoring the Clippers' defense. He's contending for the most important player on the team right next to Harden and Kawhi. || > Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil. They’re useless.
> 
> 

Publicly available defensive metrics, absolutely. There's basically zero value in those.

Publicly available overall metrics are solid. The vast majority of basketball value comes from offense and we can measure most of that. It's imperfect, but it's a very good way to determine who's in the ballpark. || My understanding is a lot of these stats weigh a bunch of counting stats heavier for centers than other roles -- which is OK up to a point because maybe a center getting an assist is more valuable than a PG doing the same, but it's hard to know. PER people who know seem to generally perceive as antiquated, right? || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || As someone who doesn't watch much Indiana or Charlotte basketball,  I'm really curious how Haliburton and Ball compare now. And to a lesser extent, Ant.  
Thinking back, man, that was a really fun draft class. || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || It's so weird, he was an all-star and top-tier playmaker an entire year on the Pacers in 22-23 season. His second half of the season in 21-22, when he was traded to the Pacers, was also really really good. His shooting averages have been good his entire career. ""One good month"" people are trolls or need to have their eyes checked because all you need to do is watch 48 minutes of the Pacers and you'll see him constantly trapped and doubled _at the logo_ and instead of playing hero ball he swings it because someone will be open, whether it counts in his box score or not.

But it's no surprise, average basketball fans are really really stupid when it comes to elite playmakers. Jokic was clowned for years and now pretty much everyone recognize how incredible he is. I wonder, what is the difference between now and years before? Ring finger, that's it. || Wouldn't models that include plus/minus stats account for this? Even if you don't necessarily generate an assist or made shot, if your ""gravity"" is actually opening things for teammates and contributing to winning it will show up in the plus/minus.",0.0,0.652,0.348,0.5859,0.032,0.837,0.132,0.9987,0.097,0.711,0.192,0.9997

His playmaking isn't anything too special but neither is Curry's. 

Kyrie's still a legend but from an eye test it seems to me like the gap between his and curry's impact on their teams is much bigger than the gap between their skills on paper, at least when Kyrie has been healthy. Does Curry's gravity really make his ceiling-raising ability that much higher? I also feel like the threat of having an elite three point shooter that is also a hyper elite slasher should have created far more opportunities for his shooters, and I also feel like his athleticism over curry should have made him a more valuable defender. 

Was his scoring style too energy-costly? Was it lack of leadership/chemistry? Off court antics? Maybe the Lebron-centric offense of Cleveland wasn't quite the optimal complimentary fit and after Cleveland he kept shooting himself in the foot.

Curry's willingness to sacrifice for the good of the team from early in his career. That's on an in-game level, where he plays off the ball and runs through a million screens to get open, and on a macro level, where he welcomed Durant to the team and scaled back his production so that KD could fit in. 

Kyrie just didn't have that in him until he was playing alongside Luka. He and LeBron could have had several more Finals runs,  in Boston he was intent on big broing JT and JB, and then in Brooklyn talked about how he and KD didn't need a coach, got Kenny Atkinson fired in favor of never-coached-at-any-level Steve Nash. 

Maybe Curry's early ankle injuries and the uncertainty that created gave him a humility that Kyrie didn't get until much later, but it's lack shaped Kyrie's career. || Curry is probably the greatest off ball player of all time. His ability to run around screens forever and have enormous gravity is so concerning for the defense that he can be the best offensive player without ""doing anything"". || You know, when Kyrie was young, it was actually a pretty vibrant debate about who was better. On the Kyrie side, people talked about his skills: Kyrie might have the best dribble in league history. Young Curry's handle, on the other hand, was nowhere near as good as it is now, which is why people kept saying he's ""not a point guard.""

And one of the biggest differences in how we evaluate players is that some people evaluate skills, and other people evaluate your impact on winning. Kyrie is off the charts from a skills standpoint. 

One of the obvious problems with his play is the extent that he likes to dribble the ball. The prototypical Kyrie possessions is him dribbling the ball 7-8 times at the top, deciding what he wants to do, and then making his move. 

One of the things analytics has taught us is how much value this costs you. Attacking a set defense is harder than attacking one that's scampering around trying to make sure everything's covered. 

You want to know why Curry has so much gravity? Because he might shoot *at any second*. Whereas with Kyrie basically says, ""Hey,  everybody, watch this!"" before he does this thing. And, you know, it IS impressive to watch. But it also means that everybody is on their correct defensive assignment, set and ready when he goes.

Also, you know, people get tired of analytic folks talking about efficiency, but the dirty little secret of Kyrie is that, while he's not *in*efficient, he's not actually super efficient, either. His TS+ for his career is 105. That's a solid, good number, especially for a guy who takes a lot of difficult shots ...

But Curry's is 113. It's elite for a high-volume scorer. He's just better at putting the ball in the basket. Kyrie's best season from an efficiency standpoint was 110, which is worse than Curry's career average. 

(Harden's career average is 110, KD's is 113. You can see that Kyrie is good in this department, but not great.)

The difference on three-point shooting is substantial, as you probably know. Curry is .423% on almost ten a game. Kyrie is .394 on six a game. 

But it's not just three-point shooting. This one always surprises people, but Curry is more efficient at shooting near the basket, too: .652 career vs. Kyrie's .626 fg% inside of three feet. This feels like it *can't* be true, because Kyrie's got this crazy array of circus moves. But that gets to the dichotomy I spoke to above: are you evaluating what a player CAN do, or how much they help you win? Kyrie can absolutely make a wider array of crazy shots near the basket than Curry (although Curry has closed the gap considerably in the past five years) - but it turns out the crazy shots don't actually count for more points. Kyrie's greater number of highlight plays at the rim are counterbalanced by more misses. || I think there are a few things.

First, the difference in shooting skill. Obviously you do agree with this, but I think it should be pointed out that Curry has taken 50% more threes than Kyrie on 3% higher efficiency over their careers. Steph is simply on another level, with his ability to take and make tough shots being far greater than Kyrie's.

Second, I wouldn't understate Curry's playmaking ability. We saw him thrive in a traditional PG-centric offense under Mark Jackson in 2014, where he averaged just short of 9 assists per game. Furthermore, the off ball gravity and attention he commands opens up immense opportunities for his teammates. Everyone intuitively knows this, but I think to really understand it one absolutely needs to watch some film analysis videos on how two defenders stay locked onto Steph during an off ball screen action, opening up the paint for his teammate to cut, or how the mere threat of Curry breaking free momentarily freezes a defender such that a shooter is left open in the corner. In terms of playmaking, they are night and day; even though Steph does most of his playmaking off the ball, he still has great assist numbers.

You made a point about finishing as well. Here, I would posit that the gulf isn't as large as people would traditionally think it to be - obviously Kyrie takes a higher volume of shots, and has an incredibly wide arsenal of layups he can utilize, but Curry is incredibly efficient at the rim (historically so during his younger days when he was more athletic) due to the unique opportunities his three point shot creates, without needing to be as flashy.

Finally, I think there's also the aspect of leadership. Kyrie is, in many ways, a pure ""hooper"" (and this is not in a derogatory manner, he is an amazing player). He gets his buckets, yes, but beyond that, Curry is uniquely able to lead a team, inspire, and do what it takes to win even at the cost of himself. I mean, just take a look at Kyrie's antics in Brooklyn or in Boston, he has never really been able to take a team to that next level on his own.

For these reasons, Kyrie's career hasn't panned out like Steph's -- he is simply less able to elevate both oneself and others to the same degree. || I think it's a couple of things and winning is the most obvious one. Curry is a proven winner. There just isn't any way to get around that. I'm not even a ""RINGS"" guy but I think it is very relevant. 

I think Kyrie's antics and lack of leadership are bigger deals, though. It seems like he can never stay settled. I'm not saying he doesn't deserve to determine his career path, but it seems like it has gotten in the way more than it has been helpful. 

Kyrie is also way less impactful when the ball isn't in his hands. Curry is the GOAT shooter, but even more importantly he affects the game massively when the ball isn't in his hands.

The streets will never forget Kyrie but I think had he won even one more finals he would be held much higher than he is now. || Steph's most elite ability (Shooting 3s at an insane clip) is a literal league-changing ability. He's changed basketball fundamentally, which, since it came at a time when nobody was doing it, caught the league by surprise and allowed for a dynasty run. Kyrie's elite ability (Amazing ball-handling), while incredible, hasn't been able to elevate his team's game.   
  
He's an incredible 1-on-1 player, but Steph's game elevated the whole franchise, Kyrie's elevated himself. It's the reason he didn't do much of anything for years before Lebron came back to the team, even though he was scoring well individually. 

I actually feel like if Kyrie had been LESS of a scorer and more of a facilitator with an unreal handles bag, he might have been more valuable over the course of his career so far. Imagine a taller Chris Paul with Kyrie's handle, or a more athletic Nash with a flashier handle.

This isn't to say Kyrie has had a bad career, but Steph's shooting just had/has way more top-end value than what Kyrie brings to the table, and that's before you get into leadership and other less tangible things. || 3 reasons.  

1: Seeing basketball in terms of 1v1 instead of 5v5.  Irving doesn't have as much of a focus on creating great team looks compared to creating shots he can hit.  This is why he's best next to guys like LeBron & Luka who are genius level at creating great looks for teammates.  Watch for what players are willing and good screen setters and the enthusiasm they make decoy cuts, there is a strong correlation between how hard players play on actions not designed to get them the ball and how much they view the game as a 5v5 game.  Offensive geniuses like Harden and Luka often fail this test.  Hustle guys like Westbrook often fail this test.  But ""selfish"" guys like Kobe can pass this test.  (In Harden's defense, he dials up his off ball game when he had a lower offensive load, so he and Luka likely have the 5v5 mindset, but pick their moments rather than making it a consistent part of their game).  

2: Over reliance on tough shot making.  Sure, Irving can beat anyone 1v1, and hit crazy hard finishes over help defenders or midrange jumpers, but a contested layup from a 6'2"" guard or a midrange jumper from a great shooter still brings lower expected points per shot than a role player taking a open 3 or a big finishing a shot under the rim.  Being able to hit tough shots has its value, but it's has less value than being able to generate easy shots for themselves and/or teammates.  

3: an incomplete understanding of talent by nba observers.  We see guys like Jokic & Steph, and think they over achieve, because we don't have good ways to quantity the advantages they get from endurance, balance, core strength, and crazy coordination, yet we are extra aware of their athletic weaknesses.  But when other players struggle with stamina, we project it as them being lazy and undisciplined rather than acknowledging that almost no players can develop Steph like endurance, even if it was their goal.  Irving has done a ton to maximize his game, but Steph has another level of conditioning that most players can never reach. || Curry is on a completely different stratosphere as a shooter and that opens up the rest of his game. Steph also has superhuman conditioning so he runs around off-ball the entire game in a way no one can. Those two allow Steph to just be a better shot creator and be more efficient. || You cannot exaggerate how great Steoh shooting is let's consider the greats that made themselves on one specific style of three form shooting James Harden off the dribble,  catch and shoot with Klay, movement shooting Reggie Miller, absurd long range Dame all of these guys who are a super star at this specific style.

Steph Cyrry has better numbers than all of them in their specialty. Hus MVP he was shooting at an efficency rate that is comparible to Shaq and Dwight Howard. He is shooting farther than everybody and his efficency can only be matched by those who shot the closest.

I don't think there is a single player other than Steph that has a skill that is set apart so far from anyone else in history.

Now the issue with Kyrie is because he isn't steph level shooting to be this high scoring player you then need to get to the free throw line something he doesn't do because he avoids contact. || People mentioning stuff like stamina, gravity, better shooting ability, etc. all of which may be true, but I think what fundamentally sets Curry apart from him is his basketball IQ. Basketball IQ is what separates superstar players and superstar winners. Curry is one of the smartest players ever in understanding how to use his skills to impact winning. 

In addition to Kyrie, you can apply this to Dame Lillard and James Harden as well. All 3 of them are 3 of the most skilled players ever. They are all some of the top shooters of all time, they all have top 10 handles ever, and unlike curry all of those guys are very explosive athletes. So you would think those guys should be able to do what Curry does right? 

But there is a reason that their elite shooting, elite dribbling, elite scoring, elite athleticism, does not lead to winning the way it does for Curry. Because those guys don’t see all the small non flashy nuances that lead to winning. Like when to set a perfect screen. Or when to move into an open spot without the ball. Or when to just make the swing pass and keep the ball moving. All the stuff that leads to winning basketball that they 100% have the ability to do, but just isn’t how they see the game. || [removed] || [removed] || 
Some shooters you close out on, but don't guard them as tightly cause they have a slow release + low 3pt percentage when closing out. 

Some shooters you have to stick to like glue because they can fire it off the second it gets in their hands, and you need to close out or run them off the line

Some shooters you have to stick to like glue, but they run around the court 30+ minutes per game, and causes so much miscommunication that he draws double teams 20 feet away from the basket, whether on purpose or not.

Guess which one Steph is, and guess which one is the most impactful. || Kyrie wanted to be a leader of a team but he is just not  a leader. That is why he did well wirh Lebron and failed wjth thr Celtics and the Nets. Then did well again with Luka next to him. || Kyrie has improved as a playmaker in his later years, but I just don’t think he’s ever been as inclined to set people up to score as Steph is.   I think people forget that before Draymond came into his own, Steph was averaging 8+ assists a game.  Like I think Steph really could’ve averaged like 27 points and 8 assists throughout his prime, but he transitioned into more of an off ball role for the sake of the team.  Draymond is much more effective when Steph plays off ball.

Then Kyrie just isn’t quite the same shooter Steph is, even though he’s still one of the best ever.  Kyrie never got into habit of shooting those really deep 3’s like Steph and Dame do.  He’s not really a threat until he’s a foot or two behind the line. Plus Kyrie never shot as many 3’s as Steph and typically doesn’t shoot them as efficiently.  So yeah he’s “almost” as efficient as Steph but it’s on like 5 fewer attempts a game and he’s taking most of his shots from right behind the line instead of taking them from 28+ feet. Steph makes defenses freak out so much because he’s  a threat from so far away.  Kyrie isn’t gonna be left open, but he’s also not making defenses bend to guard him like Steph does.  Kyrie’s crazy mid range scoring is great, but it doesn’t open up as many scoring opportunities as Steph’s style does. 

Also, Kyrie is great at attacking the paint but he never really sought out contact.  Like I’m pretty sure he averages fewer free throw attempts than Steph, in spite of being perceived as the more physical player. || Stef Curry is the greatest shooter the league has ever seen.  It's a skill beyond ""elite"", he's literally the greatest at it, in an era where shooting is much more impactful and important.  Additionally, his off-ball movement and ability to get shots off in fractions of a second with minimal space are what takes his offensive impact to another level compared to other all-time shooters like Allen, or Nash, or Miller, or Bird, etc.  He warps the defensive game plan so much that it opens up high-quality opportunities all over the floor as the defense needs to slant in his direction so much...and with all his off ball movement, that slant is constantly having to adjust all over the floor, which is nigh impossible to do.  Stef Curry is one of the greatest *offensive* players of all time, right up there with Wilt, Magic, Jokic, etc.

Kyrie Irving doesn't approach that level of impact in any way.  His best skills are ballhandling and iso scoring.  Both those skills, independent of high level playmaking skills, are only very impactful in certain circumstances - say with another high level playmaker, for instance LeBron or Luka.  While Curry's impact affects his entire offensive side, making offense easier for his entire team, Kyrie's impact is only getting his own shot off.  People might not like this comparison, but I feel like Kyrie's impact is along the lines of a player like Joe Johnson - a walking bucket to be sure, but not a player who makes other players better by making the game easier for them.

Stef Curry is in another stratosphere from what Kyrie Irving brings, and Kyrie simply never had any shot of having a career like Stef's because he is a different, and vastly inferior player. || He’s just not nearly as good as Curry.  He is better suited to being a score-first second option, he lacks elite playmaking for a PG, he isn’t much of a defender, his shot selection can be questionable, obviously a great player and a unique talent but a team with kyrie as the #1 option is going nowhere || Kyrie is awesome and is a joy to watch, but he is just not better in 5 on 5 organized basketball. Curry's game impact overshadows him in almost every aspect. It's not really close by any metric, unless you really value ""hooper"" players. || I think it's just as simple as Curry is better.  Kyrie is probably the best ball handler of all time, but outside of that there's really no conversation.  He might do different things better than Curry does, but Curry is MUCH better at his things than Kyrie is at his. Trying to put Kyrie into the Steph conversation, even if it's framed as ""why did he never get as good as him"", is kind of a forced conversation.  Kyrie is one of the best players in the league on any given night, but in terms of guys he should be talked alongside with, he's closer to Devin Booker than he is Steph Curry.  Kyrie has also never been the #1 guy on a team that has won it all, or has had sustained success. || Kyrie is self-centered, selfish and cantankerous.  Steph is laid back, rational and much more of a team player. || [removed] || You do realize playmaking isn’t just an assist numbers thing right ? Kyrie simply just doesn’t have the gravity that Steph has . Steph makes everyone around him better while Kyrie just doesn’t provide that same type of gravity or space. || His antisemitic comment because when you go up against the owners, it doesn’t play very well, especially one who was as well known as Mark Cuban when you make certain comments, you kill a career || I think Steph is so great at shooting that people tend to overlook how great he is at everything else. They just see him as a 3pt machine. His handles are elite, I'd say Kyrie is really the only one better than him, and it's not that big of a gap. His play making is wildly underrated as well, his BBIQ is way way ahead of guys like kyrie. His conditioning is on another level, his off ball game is insane. He runs around more than anyone else, even at his age now. Really the only thing he isn't elite at is defense, and his defense got better over time. Kyrie has great handles and is more athletic(explosive), but that's all he has on Steph. || Kyrie is most definitely not as good as Curry, and that's the main reason.  Otherwise, Kyrie's teams weren't as successful as Curry's teams mostly because the Warriors have had more defense (Draymond, Iguodala, even Klay), they developed more chemistry through keeping the same core together for a long time (Kyrie has changed teams a couple of times), and the Warriors system / the way that Curry fits into the system by running cuts.  Kyrie has played on a squad with Harden and Durant... and none of them got an All-Defensive selection.  People keep overlooking the fact that teams who play defense are more successful.  The Nuggets are one of the only championship teams in decades that didn't have great defense.

And Kyrie's anti-vaxxing position also disrupted his career and value as an asset at one point. || Warriors being intentional about the team construction and culture and being consistent with it for a decade plus || Most people hit the major points: 3pt shooting and leadership.

I want to add defense though. Curry took is seriously and turned himself into a decent to good team defender. He was never going to be a great 1 on 1 guy but he took is seriously.

Even in Kyries better seasons, he was never a good 1 on 1 or team defender. || It's probably not just one thing, but a bunch of things that, when you aggregate them, explain the separation. That said, I susoect the reason is the mental difference between the two -- from the outside, it appears enormous. 


(1) Talent. This is sort of obvious, but Kyrie's big advantage over other guards is his handle and shotmaking. Curry largely negates those advantages by being a comparable ballhandler and a slightly better finisher at the rim. When you also add that Steph is a better shooter outside the arc, with higher pts/rebounds/assists per 100, higher true shooting %, has vastly superior on-floor vs. off-floor +/- to Kyrie, and is a better defender than Kyrie, it starts to make a lot of sense why Steph has had the better career and is considered the better player and has won more.


(2) Injuries/luck. Luck also plays a role in the form of injuries. Steph had bad ankles early, but Kyrie's body has been chronically a problem for him his entire career. Even when playing well, he gets hurt more easily. This has clearly held him and his teams back vis-a-vis Steph, who figured out a workaround for his ankles with shoes specifically designed for him via UA. 


Funny enough, each of them won their first titles in large part due to injuries to the other. 


(3) Mental. Kyrie has historically been a self-absorbed headcase by those around him. Early in his career he was commonly derided as ""selfish, weak-spirited, and overrated,""  and there is a laundry list of self-indulgent and sometimes bizarre behavior from Kyrie. Vax, flat earth, anti-semitism, demanding trades in Cleveland and Brooklyn (leaving LeBron and KD, respectively), getting coaches fired, publicly calling out teammates in Boston, just a lot of diva bullshit. 


What's the most diva shit Steph has done? Throw a mouthpiece? Steph wants to win, even if it hurts his touches, his ego doesn't seem to rate compared to winning. If Butler had come in and started averaging 30, Steph would've figured out how to work around it and fit in. Winning is what he is about.


Kyrie is more complicated. He has been a locker room cancer at times. He is def capable of speaking out about his touches when his team is winning if he's not scoring enough. He wants to win, obviously, but he wants to win his way. He wants a full share of the glory, not to be known as LeBrin's sidekick. 


All this shit just adds up. There's just no one category that Kyrie is better than steph in a meaningful way, save maybe TOV (3.6 v. 4.4). And then you add the mental, that's the real difference IMO. || The biggest difference is off ball ability.  Kyrie might be in the same realm as Steph in terms of 1:1 basketball or defensively, but when it comes to Steph off the ball, he’s an alien the way he breaks defenses, thanks to his insane release point/variance. || You mentioned it and it cannot be overstated. Curry isn't just an elite shooter; he's THE gravitational force. Defenses are terrified of Curry anywhere past half-court, with or without the ball. This forces constant double teams, traps, and defenders sticking to him far away from the basket, creating acres of space (4-on-3 situations) for his teammates.

Kyrie is an elite shooter and scorer. However, defenses don't guard him 35 feet from the basket or panic quite as much when he doesn't have the ball. His threat is primarily on-ball. Curry's threat is constant, on and off the ball. This difference in how they stress a defense is massive for team offense.",0.0,0.828,0.172,0.3612,0.094,0.706,0.2,0.9716,0.069,0.745,0.186,1.0
Stephen Curry,"""Stephen Curry"" OR ""Chef Curry"" OR ""Steph"" OR ""Curry"" OR ""Stephen""",2025-04-09,nbadiscussion,1jw1eff,Do you believe a FMVP should go to the loser if he has actually been the best performing player?,"The discussion sparked by reading those annual social media comments about Iguodala not deserving FMVP and *only* holding LeBron to 35/13/9? Many comments were saying it was better to just award LeBron James the award because he was far and away the best performing player that series. Or I've seen comments saying to give it to Stephen Curry because he was the best, statistically, performing player on the winning team.  
 
So, for one, that narrative of ""holding Lebron to only 35/13/9"" is very deceiving. Going by [ESPN's stats](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2015/6/22/8814633/andre-iguodala-justifying-the-most-valuable-player-nba-finals-2015), Iguodala held LeBron James to 33% shooting when he was his primary defender. The Cavaliers often tried to switch Iguodala off but only succeeded 20% of the time meaning the Warriors were not allowing LeBron to force a switch to a smaller player.  Also by going through [more detailed stats](https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/106613/iggy-makes-lebrons-shooting-iffy), we see that Iguodala was not giving him any looks, allowing any switches and defending as best as one realistically can. I know it's also a team effort because no one man can stop any elite offensive superstar.  
  
With that said, Iguodala went on to receive 7 out of the 11 FMVP votes and LeBron received 4. Even with as well as LeBron was defended in Iguodala minutes, overall, he still did average absurd numbers and had a huge impact in a series than ended in 6. Should performances like this be applauded and rewarded despite it not leading to a win? Or should we reserve FMVP solely to a player on the winning team?",641,428,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jw1eff/do_you_believe_a_fmvp_should_go_to_the_loser_if/,2025-04-10 11:58:40,"I think if the player on the losing team is good enough, he should win.

Lebron in 2015 is the only series in my lifetime where I would have been fine with that outcome.

That being said, Iggy winning it is absurd. Steph was significantly more impactful and more productive. It was a narrative award because the warriors turned the series around when Iggy went into the starting lineup. I’m sure that helped, but the Cavs radically changed styles after losing Kyrie and the warriors were going to adjust to it anyways. || It has to go to close 7 and have a one man team vs a team like 2004 Pistons. If you take those Lebron stats and his team, and put them over there it would’ve been real hard to give FMVP to Chauncey. Or Rip, Ben or Sheed. Lebron would be getting that award i’m sure. || No. I believe the testimony of Jerry West, and he lacked words to express how inappropriate it felt. Toward his team mates. In regards to his own feelings, which are concerned with losing.

Some FMVPs are more legendary than others. Jerry West's is for the dramaturgy of that first occurrence. Repeating that mistake would be plain stupid, imho.

As for Iggy's MVP, no shade to Iggy, but the mistake was really taking it from Steph.

Last year Brown the MVP and it was somewhat ok because although Tatum is the best player in the team, the performance in the series was comparable and Tatum isn't a cornerstone like Curry was. The team has spacing, playmaking, defense, etc. Without him.

Without Curry, the playmaking was ok but ugly, but the difference in spacing was huge. It was a mistake to award an X factor instead of a cornerstone.

The level of a player is best assessed by the standard you judge him by. If you judge players by different standards, then the players whose standard is the highest should gets the award, period, unless the performance literally changes the way you see both players. An underperforming Curry was still way more instrumental to winning than an overperforming Iggy. And that's no shade to Iggy. There was a huge gap between Scalabrine and a college player. There was  a big gap between a top 80 player in the league then (what Iggy was ?) and Scalabrine (~400th ?). And again a big gap between a top 3 player (Curry) and Iggy. || [removed] || This happened just last year in the NHL. McDavid won it even though the Oilers lost the series. Obviously they're very different sports, but I don't think it's controversial at all to think the FMVP could still be on the losing side. || I get what the argument is for it, but I'm fine with restricting it to the winning team. It's kind of a similar thing to the MVP award - it almost always goes to someone from a good team. A player on a non-playoff team, for instance, will not win the award even if they had gaudy stats.

This is kind of the same thing. You could essentially ask, ""How valuable was your performance, if your team lost?"" I suppose you could argue that the team would have lost by a bigger margin, but a loss is still a loss. Having it be someone from the winning side makes sense, as it is basically saying that their contribution was essential to the win.

Jerry West is the only player to win FMVP while losing, but that was in the first year that they did the award. Since then, it's always gone to the winner. || Depends on the disparity between the best player on the winning team and the best player on the losing team, as well as the series itself

It’s easily to put up high numbers in a losing effort than it is on a winning effort:

•If the losing team never actually stood that much of a chance then no, the best player on that team shouldn’t get it

•If the losing team stood a chance but the best player on the losing team barely outplayed the best player on the winning team, then no, the loser shouldn’t get it

•If the losing team stood a chance and the best player on the losing team far outplayed the best player on the winning team, then yes, the loser should get it || What is the intended outcome of playing in the finals? It’s to win the finals, of course. 

If that’s the case, then the most *valuable* player should be the one who contributed the most to the winning team meeting its objective. 

This may leave a bad taste in people’s mouths for a variety of reasons, but that’s just how it’s generally been accepted to be. || No, FMVP should go to a player on the winning team. I view the award as which player made the largest impact for the winning team. I think an amazing performance by a player on the losing team should be remembered, but what exactly is the value if it results in a loss? I don’t even think a player on the losing team would be remotely interested in winning that award. || Yes, to a small extent.  LeBron was 1 vote away from winning the 2015 Finals MVP (initial votes were LeBron: 4, Iggy: 4, Steph: 3, then the Steph votes consolidated to Iguodala).

If the Cavs lost in Game 7 LeBron would’ve won the award as Draymond was the Warriors leading candidate and he missed a game, while LeBron led the series in every stat category.

The Told Larry Bird that he would’ve won in 1984 even if the Celtics had lost game 7. 

And Jerry West won in 1969, and I think a lot of people believe this was due to there not being a precedent, but I believe if that series happened again today, that West still would’ve won the award due to his dominance.

 So if it’s close, it should always go to the winner, but when the series is close and the individuals are not, it should be able to go to a player on the losing side. || Yes. Think about the regular season MVP award. The vast majority of people oppose the idea of just giving it to the best player on the team with the best record. It should go to the player who has the best performance throughout the series, even if that player's team doesn't win the series. || I think it should be possible but exceedingly rare.

Anytime any ""MVP"" conversation comes up of any kind it all comes down to what the individual person means when they say ""valuable"". Like what is their definition of ""value""/""valuable"" because it's clearly not the same for everyone. Could actually be pretty easily resolved by changing MVP award names to something more descriptive and specific but protracted debates about things like MVP are super useful to the league(s) so no incentive to change it. || If you take away the most valuable player from a losing team, they still lose. || [removed] || The best player means the best player and I'm not sure why this is such a controversial issue in American sports.  Diego Forlan won the golden ball in SA 2010 and Messi won it in Qatar; the latter also won the world cup and the former did not. It's really not that complicated but inertia and some informal rule means people get irrationally upset at recognising the best player outright. || Yeah why not

Lebron outplayed everyone on the Warriors when Igoudala won FMVP but they didn’t want to give it to the loser so Igoudala became the guy by default 

It damaged Steph’s resume to lose FMVP to a role player more than it would have to lose it to Lebron who was carrying the Cavs with no Kyrie or KLove || No, absolutely not.

The entire purpose of professional sports is to win and your *value* as a player is determined by your ability to help that team win. It doesn't matter how good your stats are, if your team doesn't win you are less valuable than a player with lesser stats.

I just don't understand the other side of this. How can you be most *valuable* if you lose? It's the Most Valuable Player award, not the Best Player award.

I get that Lebron is a far better player than Iggy, and individually had much better numbers. But in that series Iggy was more valuable to his team than Lebon was to his because he helped his team win and Lebron didn't. || It makes 100% sense that a player on a losing team could get the finals MVP but sports Journos have the simplest reading of things. There are seemingly endless examples of the ""best"" player not being rewarded for their accomplishments and impact on the field. This happens all the time with Heisman Trophy and the NFL MVP. I would love for a player on a losing team to win the award. We should be able to appreciate and recognize incredible performances even if they don't win. Granted, if you get swept/blown out, you likely won't be considered, but dragging a lesser team to a game 6 or 7 and losing close could certainly result in a FMVP, IMO. || Yes, it should be allowed, but only the narrowest of possible circumstances could justify it. The winning team would have to be a real ensemble with no obviously critical player. The Finals would have to go seven games, with the losing team BARELY not winning the title. And the losing team’s best player would have to put up a historically-dominant performance, so great that it doesn’t even seem debatable. 

No such example has happened in the last fifty years and it seems unlikely to happen. But I think that it should definitely be allowed. || Fine with it but the qualifiers would be pretty strict. Needs to be a 6 or 7 game series, and the player needs to have an all-time level performance head and shoulders above anyone on the winning team. 

A 4 or 5 game series I’d say I never would consider it. And if it goes 6 or 7 but someone on the winning team has a great performance of their own then they deserve it. || No. Someone might technically have been more valuable on the losing team, but giving it to them is some sort of cruel participation trophy.

""Hey you're crying over there in your locker room (or should be) but come out here for this award.""

That player values goes to zero once the team loses. Because if that player got injured right before the series, his team still loses. It is what it is. || Not as obvious but I think Kawhi largely won his first FMVP because he defended LeBron rather than Kawhi being the best player in the finals. Lebron was probably the best player in both those series. I get why the award basically always goes to someone on the winning team but I don't think I agree with the logic. || No. 

The ultimate value is in winning. 

Unless we want sport to be qualitative instead of quantitative. 

In which case, just award the chip to the team we ‘think’ is the best. Not the team that won. || Shoulda just been named as Playoffs MVP. With half points from playoffs and the other from Finals || This is purely anecdotal and I haven't looked at the numbers in totality. But, I did remember watching the actual game. LeBron scores a lot of garbage time points in losing games and not really impacting the chances of winning by a meaningful amount. The defense isn't actively trying to prevent him from scoring without fouling. I remember one of the games he was around 25 pts, and by the end of it scored in the mid-30's in a losing effort. || FMVP should just not exist as a real award. It's no more than those Player of the Game ""awards"" given out after every televised game. There's no real vetting process. || Who would win FMVP? Lakers vs Celtics

The Celtics have a balanced attack and win the series in 6 games. Luka delivers a dominant performance but the Lakers lose with limited contributions from the rest of the team.

Tatum averages 23/8/8

KP averages 20/5/4

JB averages 18/8/3

White averages 18/5/6

Jrue averages 12/4/7

Rest of team: 20 points

- - -

Luka averages a triple double with 35/10/12

LeBron averages 22/10/7

Reaves: 18 points

Rest of team: 25 points || No, it should never go to the losing team. It’s a straight up ridiculous idea

Competitors want to win, not get a consolation prize for being really good while coming up short || I think that it should go to the best player on the losing team if the series is close and the losing team's player was significantly better than the best performer on the winning team. || Let's be honest. Everyone thought gsw was that flash in the pan team like 75 gsw or 78 Seattle. Yeah u won now the real teams of the league will take over. 2016 steph happened and they realized oh shit we fucked up we thought u were a one off and gave him unanimous mvp as an apology for not giving him fmvp. 2018 steph fucked himself over and these voters were desperate to give him one knowing they fucked him over and created a 6 yr legacy narrative because he was the only 26 ppg scorer in nba history to not have a fmvp and that looks bad on them",0.144,0.678,0.178,0.2023,0.063,0.776,0.16,0.9798,0.108,0.651,0.241,0.9999
Stephen Curry,"""Stephen Curry"" OR ""Chef Curry"" OR ""Steph"" OR ""Curry"" OR ""Stephen""",2025-04-11,nbadiscussion,1jx81kb,The most efficient 30 PPG seasons in NBA history,"Inspired by [Hardwood Paroxysm's tweet](https://x.com/HPbasketball/status/1910709892169818573), I decided to do a slightly more in-depth analysis on the most efficient 30 PPG seasons in NBA history.

# Methodology

I decided to calculate all of the efficiency myself based off of raw total stats, as basketball-reference rounds all of their per-game statistics to 1 decimal place, affecting precision. So the process was: fetch the total stats for the season in question -> calculate each player's averages by stat/GP -> filter out non-qualified players -> calculate shooting efficiency.

To qualify, a player must:

1. Play in at least 58 games for the season.
2. Have an average of at least 20 MPG for the season.
3. Have an average of at least 29.5 PPG (rounded to one decimal place) for the season.

To calculate eFG% the formula is `((PTS - FT) / 2) / FGA`

To calculate TS% the formula is `(PTS) / (2 * (FGA + (0.44 * FTA)))`

To calculate their relative versions (reFG, rTS), it is the player's stat itself minus the league's average of the same stat. Meaning a rTS% of 5 is 5 percentual points above league average TS% for the season.

To calculate their adjusted versions (eFG+, TS+), it is the player's stat itself divided by the league's average of the same stat. Meaning a TS+% of 110 is 110% of the league average TS% for the season.

Per Game data goes back to the 1951-52 season. Per 75 Possessions data goes back to the 1973-74 season.

All data belongs to Sports Reference and was fetched and used in compliance with their Terms of Use.

I expected a bunch of Jokic rows, was surprised to see more Giannis than Jokic. Haven't been appreciating him enough. Also Steph in 2016 was truly a supernova, wow || What I learned from this is that Kareem deserves to get his flowers a lot more than he’s given. What a monster of a guy. 

Giannis too, underrated. I’ve liked his finals performance as one of the best I’ve ever seen, but I didn’t know he was this great || I will forever maintain Steph's 2015-16 season is the single best offensive season in the history of the NBA, otherworldly performance || You did a great job with this, super interesting read. Two observations:

* 2015-16 Steph might very well be the best season of all time.

* 2022-23 Embiid truly was a monstrous offensive season. || My takeaway from this thread is everyone criminally underrates Giannis because he doesn’t shoot triples || I love how you can see the free throw effect when comparing efg and ts lists. Shaq is on one side, Embiid and Shai on the other lol || that Curry season is such a cheat code, 50/45/90 with 30ppg will be veryyyyyy difficult to repeat by anyone else. || Embiid’s MVP was NOT a robbery, and there’s a case to be made for him winning it the year before even if you disagree. All said and done, he deserves 1 and Jokic deserves 3 (possibly 1 more this year) but y’all casuals love to hate on Embiid coz it’s cool and everyone does it || It’s a shame Embiid got hurt last season. Heading into his knee injury, I would argue he was having the best regular season in the modern era. 

36/12/6 in 34mpg on 65%TS, and that’s not even considering the defense

Watching that season, it’s crazy to not see it on here due to games played. What a shame || Why is Dames 2022 season not on this list? Meets all of your criteria and certainly should be

32.2 points per game, 64.5% TS% || Expected Curry at the top, was not suprised.

I'd argue that Steph's game is ALL about efficiency. He is the greatest shooter of all time. The value of the 3pt shot as well as free throws in terms of efficiency is just so much higher than almost anything else (except a dunk probably).

I'd argue that Harden was probably the first player to really focus on those 3 things - 3pt shot, attacking the rim and either get fouled for FTs or make an easy bucket. The issue was that he is a good shooter, not an all-time great one like Steph.

And Steph does all of those things just better and with offball movement.

I am actually surprised that Giannis is on here as often. Yes, most of his game over his career has basically been dunks or layups, but I actually expected his bad FT% + the amount of FT he takes on average to really lower his overall efficiency. His 3pt shooting volume is so low that it wouldn't impact his efficiency too much. || Where does Kobe rank? just curious. I’m assuming he barely missed the top 10. Especially during some of his high scoring years. 

I would guess seasons like 2002-03, 2006-07 and 2008-09 must all be pretty close in the rankings. || My only knock would be using points rather than usage%.  Slower eras won’t be represented as much.  Or is that taken into account somehow?

Thank you the great post! || Now take into account 3 pointers taken, FTs taken, 2s taken, era (defensive rules and spacing make it more difficult for certain guys, like Kobe and AI), and make sure you to stick per 75, since that's more fair.


Great job, imma save this post for myself || JorPoker no where near the top but people insist on calling him the greatest scorer ever because of “scoring tittle” when in fact he was nothing more than a chucker. For those who don’t know he took an average of 300 more shots per season that the guy that came #2 in his scoring tittle seasons. Shot chucking at it’s finest. || Genuinely curious, is there a player who satisfied the 1 and 3 requirement (GP and PPG) and not requirement 2 (MPG)? || He might really be in the 🐐 convo with Mike if 2016 Bron didn’t happen… imagine if Steph had that regular season and a finals MVP in the midst of a 4peat? || Why did you filter by minutes. Was there anyone averaging 30 who played fewer than 20 mpg? If so, that'd be an impressive feat of efficiency on its own || Another metric that showcases how historic Jokic' current season is, and how overrated Shai is.

Also very impressive how superb Giannis is... And with ALL NBA defense. How incredibly underrated. A shame he will likely be chained to just one championship. || Wilt doesn't look nearly as impressive as his seasons really are due to your framing. He was setting the all-time FG% marks while simultaneously shattering the all-time scoring records. Only 2-7 players were reaching the 50% mark in a season then and yet he was doing so while also taking 15-20 more shots and breaking records. They are far more impressive than anything else you've shown here. || With one more game to go, is there any way for Jokic to overtake Curry at the number 1 in efg%? || Curry ‘15-‘ 16 
PPG 30.1   Attempts 20.2

Harden ‘17-‘18 
PPG - 30.4   Attempts 20.1 || fun analysis! really enjoyed reading - the piece that this is missing from this story is the system/team these players were on.

Curry is obviously one of the most efficient scorers of all time but the system created for him enabled it. Same way the systems built around Kobe, AI, and Beal causing them to take more difficult shots due to limited options or a bad team where the defense was anchored on them because of the other players being low threats. Why not look at Offensive Ratings/efficiencies relative to their team/league

also for relative FG% - this could be further analyzed by comparing to the average FG% for the players position of players with a minimum number of FGAs per game to control for these players having to take more difficult shots then say a corner 3 guy or a SG compared to a Center's FG.

lastly the 29.5 PPG is a really limiting criteria - this list would look completely different if controlled differently - the 29.5 PPG basically makes your 20 MPG & 58 games played useless. not many players will fit the criteria of 29.5 PPG outside of those other criteria. || The comments saying “best season of all time”, “best offensive season of all time” when literally the only thing this data reflects in efficiency of players who hit 30+ and nothing else is absolutely wild lol. || Steph's 15-16 to me is not just the undisputed greatest offensive regular season of all-time, but just straight up the best regular season of all-time, period. But yeah, Steph having two seasons in this top 10 as a 6'1"" shooting PG is bonkers || Something tells me that he could’ve had multiple seasons like that one, but refuses to because it’s not really meaningful basketball if the team isn’t really getting the most out of it.

For example, he could’ve pushed to break the 3pointer record vs the Grizzlies, but opted not to because opting to do the little things that made the team win held more importance to him || Could make an argument that Curry should have won mvp in 21, especially now that some are coming out of the woodwork to disqualify team wins/seed as a point to elevate Jokic over SGA this season. Exactly the argument used against Curry that season. || Thank you for the engagement and appreciation! :)

Giannis is definitely one of the most underrated players of all-time, specially offensively.

Honestly my biggest surprise is KD showing up the same amount of times as Isaiah Thomas, but he ""only"" has 2 qualifying seasons || I think the number of “3 qtr” games Steph had limited the number of times he’s on the list.  

Same with the limited number of times KD and Jokic have had 29.5ppg seasons.",0.0,0.721,0.279,0.4754,0.0,0.978,0.022,0.9446,0.083,0.704,0.213,0.9997
