LeBron James,"""Lebron James"" OR ""King James"" OR ""Bron"" OR ""Lebron"" OR ""Bron Bron"" OR ""LBJ""",2025-01-27,nbadiscussion,1ic2mtz,"No, it's not recency bias, Jokic is that good.","This season, Jokic is currently averaging 30.3/13.1/10.2, putting him 3rd in scoring, 3rd in rebounding, and 2nd in assists. Meanwhile he is averaging 65.7% TS, making him the 2nd most efficient volume scorer (players scoring at least 20.0 ppg), behind only Sabonis. Oh yeah and he's the third most efficient 3 point shooter in the league hitting 47.4% of his attempts. That is a mind bogglingly impressive box score. You could very seriously  argue that Jokic is the only player in NBA history to simultaneously be the best scorer, play maker, and rebounder in the world.

Throughout NBA history, there have been exactly 5 individual season where an individual recorded a BMP of 13.0 or higher. 1 was LeBron in 2008-09, the other 4 were all Jokic. This season he is on pace to break his own record, with a BMP of 14.23.  Yes, BMP can be a flawed stat, but the individuals with top 10 BMP seasons not named Jokic are Michael Jordan (3 times), LeBron James (once), and Steph Curry (once). That is a very, very good list to be a part of.

My last point is that off of vibes I've gotten watching basketball over the last few years is that it has felt like Jokic has been the best basketball player in the world for the last 4 years . How many all time greats over the  last several decades could really claim to have been the best player in the league for 4+ years? Not many. MJ, LeBron, Kareem. Maybe, Shaq, Magic or Tim Duncan.  

  
My point is, that Jokic is that guy. Not only is he awesome, he is historically awesome. It is not ridiculous to consider him to be amongst the greatest centers to ever live, and you should not dismiss him simply because his team didn't win a team award as often as others.",867,316,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ic2mtz/no_its_not_recency_bias_jokic_is_that_good/,2025-01-28 09:22:34,"This post is mostly focused on defining the abilities of a single player, which is great. Unfortunately, the comments focusing on ranking that player, got rapidly uncivil and focused on measuring egos instead of sharing insights. 

Post can remain as an exception to our rules but comments are locked. || Peak-for-peak he has a pretty good case for being the best offensive player ever. I would also say he has a top 10 peak of all-time.

We don’t need to jump the gun on career discussions for him though. It’s not just a rings thing, it’s longevity too. Most guys in that top 12 range have 12+ years of elite play. Jokić has only been star-caliber for 7-8 years. He’ll naturally get his due as his career progresses. || I might be early but for me he’s the best centre I’ve ever seen, I didn’t get to see all of Shaq’s prime but i only remember the later years. Jokic didn’t play with Kobe or D Wade either, even his co star can be inconsistent but there’s no doubt he makes almost everyone a better player, look at Russ this season for example. || Definitely not arguing with the title, but pulling up stats are kind of pointless. Efficiency stats when comparing eras just don't make sense. And the reason his BPM is so historic is the team is appalingly bad when he is not on the court. Now that usually happens when you have a superstar because the rest of the team is cramped with the salary cap. When salaries weren't as crazy in the 70s/80s, teams always had built out rosters. So you didn't see teams cratering when the star was off the court like you do in the Lebron/Steph/Jokic era.

  
Again, I think he's historically great. To crack the GOAT tier discussion, he'll need to win a few more championships. May not be fair to him in the era of parity, but those are the breaks. || The only pushback I’d give is that I don’t think Jokic was the consensus best player in the league until 2023.  A lot of people had Giannis over him until the 2023 title run.  Now of course we can just argue that’s due to winning bias (I’m not sure Jokic got appreciably better between 2022 and 2023, his team was just better), I’m just saying idk if it’s fair to say he’s been the consensus best player for the last 4 seasons.  There were lots of questions about his defense and how well it would hold up in the playoffs. 

He has been a top 3 player for the last 3-4 seasons though, and he’s in the midst of one of the greatest peaks we’ve ever seen. || [removed] || Yeah and he's 4th in steals too with a great assist to turnover ratio. It's actually crazy || Jokic has highest 3 point percentage cause he actually has around 15 heaves this season, if not for those he would would be above 50% || The only thing that matters is championships.   That's it!

He's got one which definitely helps his cause.   If he didn't win one,   I would put him in a different category with Malone or Barkley. || Agree.

I've watched NBA on and off for 35 years and both the eye test and the stats are in agreement, he is a generational big man. As long as he stays healthy and reproduces his current form for a decent number of years he is on track to finish his career as one of the ten greatest players of all time.

Trying to rank him against other all time greats is dificult for the same reason Bird is tough to rank- joker is just so fucking perfect offensively that it papers over any other cracks in his game. || His peak could still be going for few more years
He doesn’t rely on being athletic he only falls off when his focus is off || Agreed with most the comments he is the best offensive player ever

And I would say His defence isn’t elite, but it’s definitely underrated || He has a great case obviously 



I diminish jokic from greats simply because...


DEFENSE.


Bill Russell 11 rings DEFENSE 
Shaq DEFENSE 
Hakeem DEFENSE 
Kareem DEFENSE 
Duncan DEFENSE 
Wilt DEFENSE 


Jokic has a great case but there is a reason when we talk top 5 any position or top 5 centers they all have DEFENSE || Just going to add that if you removed end of the quarter heaves, which Jokic leads the league in, then I believe he is the most efficient 3 point shooter in the league. || [removed] || He is on a five year run that is at least ARGUABLY better than anyone else’s. And the years before his numbers were still all nba level. At some we have accept that super efficient scoring, wonder passing and dominant rebounding combined with the most team oriented mindset possible probably will make you a legendary player. I think he’s better at the game than Magic or Bird. We are watching a phenomenal player in his prime. In the same way as I accepted Steph was the GOAT shooter quite early in his career I now accept that Denver had a top 10 player of all time. Things improve and people get better at playing games it’s only to be expected that a 2025 player might  do some things that weren’t being done in 05 or 95. I think we should all enjoy it. || Giannis is right there with him if not better. Defense is a thing in the NBA. || Comparing players across eras is dumb especially if you don't have a clear cut criteria. Plus anything you judge a player on is based around their teammates rather it's stats, awards or winning everything is skewed by how good or bad your teammates are and the fit put around the best player. || Yep. We’re watching a basketball savant. He’s the most bizarre super talent I’ve ever seem. Incredibly limited athletically in a sport that rewards athleticism as much as any sport, but his IQ, size, strength, vision, hand eye coordination, mentality, and work ethic are all off the charts elite.

Guy is truly an anomaly, and so much fun to watch.  || he's in the midst greatest offensive peak ever. never seen a dude elevate average players like this. westbrook was on his way out of the league! aaron gordon, bruce brown, KCP, efficiency jumped huge playing next to joker. 

give this dude an allstar like every other ATG had and its a wrap. bulls dynasty had scottie locked in on a notoriously underpaid contract, meanwhile nugs are paying murray and MPJ max to be average efficiency volume scorers. 

if joker had a competent FO behind him he would already have 4 rings. their best value signing in Westbrook was JOKER's  idea ! dude is a better GM than his own GM || “Because his team didn’t win a team award as often as others”? He has more mvps than conference finals appearances lol. You can’t put him in the same category as MJ, lebron, Kareem, Shaq, magic, and Tim Duncan yet. And best player in the league for the past 4+ years? Maybe but embiid won an mvp during one of those years. And I’d argue that the best player in the league on the best team the past 4+ years has been Tatum. Deep playoff runs every year. || You guys know when you make your best players ever that you don't really have to include players like pre 80s even pre 90s, it's not like you saw Bill Russell so why would I put him in my top ten. Make your own top 10 with what you know, dont be a sheep || [removed] || Ok, let's discuss. 

Yes, Jokic is that good, for all the statistical reasons you listed... And, he did finally lead his team to a very elusive title, and has a good amount of accolades. 
But, what does that mean?

A lot of the NFL world seems ready to crown Patrick mahomes the goat, for potentially winning 3 super bowls in a row. Why? Cuz there, they understand the importance of winning, over statistical achievements. 
Yes, the NFL is different, and due to winner take all playoff formats, it's harder to win 3 in a row. I'll give you all of that. 

Bringing it back to the NBA... What criticism is often levied against Wilt Chamberlain, for his goat case? He didn't win enough. I can provide all sorts of context and history, regarding the Bill Russell superteams, and lack of free agency and post injury Wilt and blah blah... But, at the end of the day, he didn't get it done, despite his ridiculous list of all time records (which are even smaller than they should be, cuz certain stats weren't even counted when he played...)

Winning matters, is the point. It shouldn't be your end all, be all... But, it matters. 

And in that category, we need to pump the brakes a little bit for Jokic.

Then there's the recency bias issue, of trying to put the proper context around Jokic in this era, and trying to compare that to previous era's---which is already a fools errand in many ways. But, the entire play style of the league is very different. The rules are different. Positionless basketball is a very new concept. Centers of the past trained their entire lives to play in those styles and systems. David Robinson is a GREAT center---but recency bias, stats, and analytics will never give him the credit he deserves. They also won't add any context or history, of him consistently playing against other great centers. 

Your comparing a guy, with an insane usage rate, in a positionless league, who has the ball in his hands all the time, and basically makes all the decisions on the floor... To players of the past, that had roles, played in systems, were generally less ball dominant, etc, had to rely on point guards to get them the ball, where high scoring point guards were anomalies... These are the areas where recency bias will tell you Jokic is ""SO MUCH BETTER"" than everyone before... When it's more complicated than that. 

Also, it's an inflated era. The commissioner has admitted, on camera, rules were changed intentionally to make scoring easier. Pace and more 3s makes it easier for rebound opportunities, and not just for centers anymore. There's no physicality in the league. Assists are given out like candy now. Freedom of movement and carrying/lack of travels makes it easier for everyone... The spacing has never been so wide open... The center position has NEVER been so physically weak, out of necessity, to keep up with modern offenses.

So ya... Admire what he's doing. But no, he's not goat center yet, he's not top 15 already...

Damn... Let his have his career. Recency bias and analytics are frothing at the mouth to put all these players right now in goat conversations and put them as all time greats, before they've even put in the real work. || Not Magic for 4 years. Bird though for sure 

3 MVP
5 runner ups in 8 years || My only contention with his placements among the offensive goats is his slight playoff dip. I'd expect a guy with his regular season profile to either have LeBron or Jordan relative box score numbers, or goat level impact data, but he doesn't have either of those, in the playoffs. || Stats aren't everything. He has great stats-- legendary stats, the best stats--yes. And he can make a team better when he's the focal point.

But beyond that, he lacks a lot of the traits that ""the best player in the world"" should have:

* the ability to take over games and series, night in, night out
* the ability to carry a team much farther than they would go otherwise
* excellent defense
* dominating his fellow stars in at least one All-Star game
* helping his team win multiple rings (still to be decided)
* the dominant ""Shaq effect"" that makes he and his team feel unbeatable 
* the killer approach of MJ
* the all-around dominance of prime Bron

He looks like ""one of the best,"" but not ""the best."" Right now, SGA is who really impresses me. || If Embiid never got hurt last year then he would have ran away with the MVP again. Why isn’t that talked about? || I think he's currently the best player in the league, and has been for the last 3-4 seasons.

  
His passing (better than LeBron's), footwork (great fundamentals), and shooting (both midrange and 3p) are elite. The only thing holding him back is that he isnt athletic, but he is strong and has immense stamina. || Jokic is just like Wilt Chamberlain.

So with AD's urgency to play PF and AD's making good points about how him playing the 4 and having McGee start at the 5 and Dwight being the backup was the best recipe of success based on the 2020 title, why can't JJ start Jaxson Hayes at the 5?

You can have Reeves and Christie start at the 1 & 2 with LeBron playing the 3 and the Lakers still have enough shooting with Reeves and Christie being decent from 3. Hayes plays the McGee role as an athletic lob threat big that can block shots and would fit well starting next to AD.

I believe fans should demand JJ Reddick to start Hayes if that's what AD thinks is the best chance for the Lakers to succeed, does r/nbadiscussion agree with me?",24,59,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ibobku/lakers_starting_jaxson_hayes_at_c/,2025-01-27 19:05:00,"Hayes can't start at the 5, because he's not good enough to start at the 5.

Davis isn't a good enough outside shooter to justify playing him and Hayes together.

That's why Davis plays the 5. || Somebody posted this in the Lakers sub too lol. No. He’s barely good enough to be a backup let alone start. || I just don’t think Jaxson Hayes is a starting caliber player. McGee and Howard were better rim protectors and better rebounders. I think LAs opponents would prefer to challenge Hayes at the rim and make AD guard their 4 (hopefully) away from the hoop. 


To be blunt, if Hayes starts, he is probably a bottom 5 starting center in the nba. My favorite team is desperate for a backup center, and I wouldn’t give up a second rounder for him


Also, if you’re going to add a non-shooter to the starting lineup, then they better have a high demand skill like defense or rebounding || I mean if Hayes was a good player I’d be for it but as a Laker fan I think he’s one of the worst centers in the league and rarely a net positive. 
He’s a poor rebounder for being a 7 footer, his positioning and boxing out is atrocious; doesn’t make great rotations defensively, and is good for only wide open lobs/dunks on offense. 

Plus he hits women so I’d like for him to be gone from this team. || Jaxson hayes doesn’t block shots. Jaxson hayes is an undisciplined defender. Jaxson hayes has a low motor for rebounds. Jaxson hayes doesn’t box out consistently. || LeBron can't really guard 3s any more so if the Lakers can't play AD at the 5 they are kinda fucked. At this stage of his career Bron can't chase around the smaller, quicker guys all game. || Back in 2020, the Lakers went to lineups with AD at the 5 when the chips were down. He hasn't really been hitting his jumpers since the bubble which means the spacing will be really awful with him and a traditional center on the court. Also, the Lakers single deepest position is already power forward - LeBron, Rui, and DFS are all natural fours and the team is really lacking for perimeter defense outside of Christie. Trying to play AD at the four just further skews a roster that's already a bit too big and slow overall. 

I don't think anyone in LA besides AD really believes they're better off with him playing power forward. The fact that he doesn't like to do the dirty work at center doesn't change the fact that he's a pure center in the modern NBA. || I think the problem with AD at the four is he can’t shoot the basketball. He is a play finisher who sometimes gets hot from the mid range. You just can’t play that as your PF without a stretch five and those are few and far between. 

It’s not like the Lakers have a ton of shooting on their roster and sliding him plus another non shooter into the starting five I think grinds the O to a halt. You just really can’t get away with playing two-non shooters in 99% of cases || If the Pelicans roster moves at centre are any indication, Hayes is pretty worthless. He barely played when Hernangomez and Valencunias were on the Pelicans, and Missi and Theis have been way more valuable this year than Hayes ever was IMO || Hayes is barely a NBA player. I’m a Pelicans fan so I had high hopes for him originally, but he is the same player today that he was coming out of Texas.

He’s just not good. || The thing is though, Jaxson Hayes simply is not a starting caliber big many. He’s a very limited offensive player, a pretty good but not special rebounder and an average to maybe slightly above average defender at his position. Is he a competent bench big you can trust to play 15-20 minutes? Sure, but he definitely isn’t a player you want starting playing 30-35 minutes a night in play off. 

I also think it’s a bit problematic for a player to have final say on a rotation over a coach. That type of situation always ends with bad locker room. This idea is even sillier when you realize AD never said he wants Hayes to start. He said he wants the front office to trade for a big man so he can play the 4. Those aren’t the same thing at all. If anything his demands that the front office trade for a new starting center implies he doesn’t think Hayes is good enough to be that guy for them. || They need a big because they have Hayes. He’s not very good. They are just hoping they could get a starting quality C for cheap. Might not be possible. || Jaxon Hayes is really, really, REALLY bad at basketball. After his contract with the Lakers he will be out of the league.

Genuinely one of the most horrific centers in the league. || AD's been trying to play the 4 for most of his career. But the stats don't back up the idea that it's a good option. 

Even though Dwight started 5 of the 6 games in the 2020 Finals, he only played 71 minutes in 6 games (9th in minutes). Javale McGee didn't play that series. AD played 230 minutes, almost all of them at 5.

In the WCF vs Houston, the centers combined for 46 minutes in 5 games while AD played 186. So yeah, AD was their 5 for that run and that's part of the reason they won it. 

JJ is smart enough to know what lineups won't work and why, but also smart enough to keep his stars happy...so it might not be a bad idea to start Hayes occasionally, depending on the matchup, but then still close games with AD at Center. || wtf is with AD not wanting to play the center? It’s gotta be one of the weirder continuous storylines for a star player we’ve had || Hayes is just not a good enough player to be a starter. I dont think hes a good enough player to be in a playoff contending rotation at all but Lakers dont have much choices right now lol hes definitely just a piece at this point to make any trade offers even the least bit more appealing

Dwight and Mcgee worked because they were athletic lob threats that were really good at rebounding and defending the pick and roll and the paint. Jaxson Hayes does none of those things well || He’d foul out of every game. Any game where he plays 15+ minutes he’s guaranteed to be playing with 4 or 5 fouls. He’s a springy athlete who can block the occasional shot but that’s about it. His offensive game is limited to the dunker’s spot to catch the occasional lob. Good athlete. Bad hooper || They didn’t tonight, though they did play the 2 together. Buy he’s always felt this way even though makes no sense fgggdhgfxvgcsehjihhjbvnbvjfgh hb. Hunch || In theory Jaxson Hayes is like 20lbs of muscle and a handful or two of basketball iq points away from being Javale McGee, and i think at the start of the season he was showing some great strides in improving play. But also i think the injury has zapped that improvement a bit and he’s still working his way back up. 

The measurements and athleticism often trick me but his peak is serviceable back up big. || Pels fans wanted the Hayes experiment to work out (until his domestic altercation) and he would shine on some nights and then be invisible or even detrimental to the Pels far more often. Like someone else said he’s an athletic freak who is not very good at basketball || I said this type of  lineup before but to me it only works with a back up big and actually Hayes plays like a power forward to me. The Lakers fans like small ball and wasn't feeling it.

I was saying Hayes at 4 though but it depends on the type of big they get if any. 

But lakers tight with the money and picks. The fans are something else. Dumbest fanbase. Look at what nonsense they talking. Basketball is about a fit
 Everybody don't have to be a super star. They don't seem to get that. The scary part is Reaves and Christie startingm Lakers need stronger wings with a shooting ability. Hayes can add size so me ron won't be guarding bigger players so much || AD isn't advocating for Hayes to be at the 5, he wants to them to trade for a really good player to start at the 5. In other words he feels he can't win without those cats so he needs a new one alongside him. || They need to get that boy from Miami heat in, Kelel Ware. Or they could go for the big haul and trade Rui and AD for Giannis and brook. || Jackson Hayes will get bullied that’s why. He is 7ft tall and weighs 220lbs , he is the same weight as most guards. He will get dominated in the paint by guys like Giannis and Joker or probably any other C || He is not even good enough to be the backup C || Checking this now that he’s the starting center and AD is gone. || Hayes legitimately might have the lowest basketball IQ in the league. I don’t get how he’s played basketball for so long and doesn’t understand what a moving screen is, and he’s constantly out of position on both ends of the floor. || Nah he’s good we’re always better when he’s on the court || I mean, AD can guard 3’s. || He fits the mold of a Giannis next to Lopez as much as an AG next to Jokic pretty well. He personally performed well with centers as different as Dwight/Javale and Marc Gasol.

But those players aren’t easy to come by. Does he look good next to a Vuc? Or a Turner? Both of which are awkward fits if they’re not actually hitting their jumpers that month.

I just think this is him sounding the alarm bells on, “82 games is a lot to be the only center on this roster,” which he isn’t wrong about. That isn’t a real team the moment he checks out. Him missing from the Lakers defense is as demonstrable of a gap as Jokic from the Nuggets offense. It immediately crumbles into a layup line as quickly as the Nuggets stagnate.

I know he won Finals MVP in 2015 and was a key part of their dynasty, but how does he compare to other players, especially wings from his era? Was he a legit star, or more of an elite role player who just happened to be in the right system?

I’m mainly curious about his defense—people always talk about how he locked down LeBron in 2015, but was he always that good? Was his defense consistent throughout his whole career, or was it just a few standout moments? And on offense, I know he wasn’t a huge scorer, but he was a solid playmaker and had great IQ. Can that really make someone a star? Or was he just a role player who did his job and fit perfectly with the Warriors?

I always hear people say he’s a Hall of Famer because of his leadership and defense, but I’m not totally sure about that. I didn’t watch him with Philly or Denver, so I’m wondering—was he really good back then, or was he just carrying his weight on a team full of stars with the Warriors? He definitely wasn’t as flashy as other guys, but he was always solid, so I’m trying to figure out if he was underrated or just lucky to be in the right situation.

I know he’s respected, but I’m curious where he really stands in the grand scheme of NBA history. So what do you think? Was Andre Iguodala a star in his own right, or was he just a really good role player on some great teams?",44,61,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1id7950/how_good_was_andre_iguodala_throughout_his_career/,2025-01-29 17:57:21,"He's the forward equivalent of Jrue Holiday in terms of player ""tier"" and quality. I do'nt know how he didn't get more all defensive teams, should have gotten 6 or 7 of them. He was top 10 in DPOY voting 4 times but only got 2 all defense teams? Weird. || Secret Base did a rundown on his career that I highly recommend. 

In short, he idolized Scottie Pippen more than MJ and based his game around being an elite role player. When Philly traded Iverson, Ig was able to step up and be the main guy for an okay team, but it wasn’t natural for him.  When he left Denver, they had just been eliminated by the up and coming Warriors and took a pay cut to sign with them seeing that they were a few glue guys away from being title contenders. 

Was he a ‘star’? Was he an ‘elite role player’? Yes to both. But being a sidekick suited his mentality much more || I would say he’s a poor man’s Scotty pippen who was put into an ideal situation. 

He was basically Draymond Green on defense without the size inside but could actually be an absolute pest as POA with his speed and wingspan. He’s the one who taught Green how to swipe the ball in the post like a mind reader.


In offense he was our best passer, best eagle vision, low turnover, serviceable 3, and would make a highlight dunk every other game. Leads wouldn’t drop with him coming off the bench. 


He is best as your 4th or 5th best player. Any higher and you probably missing the secret sauce for him. || Iggy became Philly's new franchise player after Iverson. And it certainly looked like he was on his way to become a star player.

How athletic young Iggy was seems to be forgotten now. The biggest issue was that his prime started right after Iverson left. So he was on a pretty average team.

His athleticism actually started to decline rather early on, his scoring ability became more limited as a result but finally found success as a role player. 

I mean I thought that 2015 FMVP was a hipster choice. But of course he was very valuable for that Warriors team. I really don't think he should be a Hall of Famer though. || There's an advanced-stats argument to be made that he was one of the ten best players in the league in the early '10s. I don't have the data handy, but he was shockingly close to the top of the charts in multi-year RAPM.

Obviously this isn't anywhere close to as definitive as RAPM, but Phill went from 3rd to 15th in defensive rating when he left. Denver was 20th the year before he showed up, 11th when he was there, and 21st the year after he left, and the Warriors were 14th before he arrived, and 4th once he got here.

The only one of those teams I can talk about with a lot of detail is the Warriors, and obviously Iguodala was not the only difference on that team. While Klay, Draymond, and Bogut had been on the team the year before, Klay and Draymond were rookies (Draymond barely played; Klay played but had a pretty steep adjustment to the NBA) and Bogut had been severely limited by injury the prior year. So it's not ALL Andre.

But it's not NOT Andre, either. (As a point of reference, when LeBron first got to LA, yes, he only played 55 games that season, but the team did not improve in ORTG or DRTG.

In Philly, the team kept trying to turn him into a 1A lead scorer, and that just wasn't his skill set, and so much of how we evaluate ""stars"" is based on being a 1A scorer. In fact, I distinctly remember how when he came to the Warriors, his high RAPM was used by anti-analytics folk to argue that *obviously* RAPM was junk, there was no justification for ranking him that high. His scoring was a central part of those discussions, as I recall. (If you think the discussion about how to evaluate defense is iffy now, trust me, it was substantially worse a decade ago).

It also has to be said that Iguodala was in the perfect situation with the Warriors, with Curry, and in Kerr's offense. He's an incredibly smart and willing passer. He shot was fine but slow - it was accurate if he had time. You know how you get enough time to earn an FMVP with a slow shot? You have the defense selling out like mad to stop Curry.

The 2015 Warriors team is forgotten now compared to the 2017 team, but it needs to be remembered how they terrorized the league for almost two whole seasons, and Iguodala was a big part of that. That team was first in defense and second in offense, and he contributed to both sides of that. || I'd say Iggy is a beneficiary of ""rings culture"".  He was pretty good, but not great.  He was a high level defender and a B level offensive guy.  In past eras, you would've never heard his name mentioned again after he retired.  But rings culture turns everyone with a ring into a legend.  I watched every minute of that 2015 finals.  Lebron had the best performance in that series, but his team lost.  Bron averaged 35 ppg despite being ""locked down"" by Iggy. || Iggy was a great player in his own right, but never the type of players to put up huge numbers and be THE GUY on a team. He could have been and had his chances to do that, but for Golden State he did everything necessary to allow the stars to do what they do, which is put the ball.in the bucket. Top level defender, competent ball handler and decision maker, and hall of fame level glue guy. Golden State doesn't win 4 without him. Maybe 2 or 3, but def not 4. If he wanted i'm sure there's a position on the staff there because he's as big as part of establishing their culture as Steph and Draymond. || He's like a low level star. Kinda like a consistent, versatile star instead of a dominant one.

Versatility is what made Iguodala special.
He's not really a specialist, but he does everything at a pretty good  level.

He's not really a great scorer, but he was decent, especially with Philly.
He's not really a shooter, but he can make it when it counts. 
Not really a playmaker, but he can do it if he had to.
Not really an elite defender, but, when he had to, he'd defend the best players.
Never really been a great rebounder, but he was solid.
Not a great ballhandler, but he can do it.

He's like a less skilled version of Paul George. Paul George can do everything, but he's so dominant as a scorer and defender, he became an MVP candidate.

Iggy is kinda like PG, but to a lesser degree.
You just can't find holes in their skillset , but their skill levels are different. || I watched hi in the finals versus a injury riddled Cav team. I also watched him year's after. I really think he gained from the lethal shooting of Curry like many other good but not great players, i.e. Andrew Wiggins. The power of Curry's range and accuracy made everyone better. He's so lethal I'd put him up there with Jordan, more lethal than Kobe, and LeBron. I know this is an assessment of Iggy and he was a great player. Unselfish, played solid defense, made the shots he needed to make. But let's not forget he shined because he had the most lethal scorer on the court. Not to mention Thompson. I like Iggys game and attitude, he understood his role and never strayed. That alone is enough to give him an MVP. || I don’t think I’m alone in wondering how things would have been different if Toronto drafted him in ‘04. He would have had a very interesting fit with Bosh, and we fuckin whiffed on Araujo one pick before! 
Probably not contenders, but absolutely a higher ceiling and probably a really entertaining duo. || > I’m mainly curious about his defense—people always talk about how he locked down LeBron in 2015, but was he always that good? Was his defense consistent throughout his whole career, or was it just a few standout moments?

He was a good defender earlier in his career too with the added bonus of being a solid #2 or #3-level offensive option as well - although after Iverson was traded away, the problem was he was often being asked to be the #1 offensive option, and he wasn't *that* good of a scorer. With the Warriors he was able to focus on defense more, plus he was past his prime and couldn't score as well consistently, so he became more of a defensive specialist. Also, while he was getting more attention because of the team success, he was playing the same defense he had done for pretty much his whole career - just short of the elite wing defenders of his time to me (Tony Allen, Bruce Bowen, Ron Artest) but very good and probably should have made more than just 2 all-defense teams. || I don't remember him much as a 76er aside from him enterimg the dunk contest. I kniw him moatly playinf for the Warriors ans briefly for the Miami Heat. But he is a smart basketball player on defense and has long ass arms with big hands. || Pretty damn good, I remember being devastated when he left denver. Felt like the only all star we’d ever have || Fantastic POA defender, one of the few I’ve seen lock up LeBron. Great passer, super high BBIQ. Could score when he really needed to, but that wasn’t his main thing. The ultimate glue guy. Did he benefit from playing with the peak Warriors? Of course! But they really missed him when he was gone. Very important to the locker room culture - Steph, Klay and Draymond were still kids when he joined. || Jrue holiday is the best comparison and ironically they were both teammates in Philly. Neither of them will take you to a championship as the #1 option but they are both perfect glue guys that will raise the ceiling from good to champion level. || He didn't get any 6MOTY titles despite arguably being the most important sixth man in basketball for five years straight. Sometimes awards are just stupid that way... but my personal conspiracy theory is that the backlash to his FMVP which caused the voters to ignore him. || I think I could argue Jrue to be a more complete player, but this is absolutely the best comparison and reference right now. || I think this covers it well

He was not an aggressive scorer,  didn’t have that bravado or next level confidence to throw up 20fga a night and instead found his niche as the ultimate glue guy. || I don’t think I would ever call him a “star”. I’d argue his peak is similar to what a Brandon Ingram has been (putting up decent numbers on bad teams). 

Obviously the later half of his career is no where near what Ingram has done, but his time on the 76ers, I never heard anyone call him a star. || I wouldn’t call him a star. You couldn’t build a team around him but he was an elite athlete and had an elite BBIQ, the combination of those skills made him a fringe all star when he was the main guy and an elite role player. || To be clear, he was not our best passer. But yes, he was an above average passer for a forward. || [removed] || I've recently taken to Bill Simmons oldhead take of looking at the Hall of Fame as a museum, where it holds the most important pieces of basketball, saying ""this guy, for a while, meant something important"". It's how you can justify players like Pistol Pete making the cut. As such, I think Iguodala has an outside case, about as strong as Robert Horry, who I also believe should be in over some players.

I loved Mitch Richmond, both on the Warriors and Kings, but Iguodala is frankly more important to basketball than he was. || Lebron shot 39% in that series and went 3/17 in clutch time, without getting double teamed. He absolutely got locked down by Iggy. || In fairness, I think Lou Will and Jamal Crawford were holding those titles down at that time. 

Makes absolute sense he didn’t steal one imo. || He definitely was an aggressive scorer in Denver in terms of getting to the rim and absolutely hamming it down || [removed] || Please keep your comments civil. This is a subreddit for thoughtful discussion and debate, not aggressive and argumentative content. || Exactly. People bring up the basic stat line but don't dig further.

He not only continued to play at a high level, he also has looked better since the season started & with the All-Star reserves coming out tomorrow, I thought it'd be fun to go through his case for it & see where other fanbases also stand here(I'm a Heat fan).

Right now, he's averaging 25/5/6 per 75 possessions on 58% eFG & 62% TS. The only players that matched are Shai, Giannis, Jokic & Curry.

Starting with the impact metrics(EPM by Dunks and Threes; LEBRON by BBall-Index; DPM by Darko; eRAPTOR by Neil Paine), he ranks:  
\- 18th in expected O-EPM with +3.5  
\- 9th in actual O-EPM with +4.2  
\- 17th in O-LEBRON with +2.5  
\- 35th in O-DPM with +2.0  
\- 18th in O-eRAPTOR with +3.5

He ticks off the having good production, elite efficiency(especially given the volume, responsibility, role AND team context), and he also has the advanced metrics in his favour, too.

By all but 1 metric, he's ranked in the top 20 on offense.

Also, do note that I'm focusing on the offensive side. Defensive metrics haven't liked him at all this year(for some, it's the worst in his career). But that matters less to me for things like the All-Star game. This isn't about who's better or who would you rather have on a contending team, where more factors come into play.

What simply matters is what is the job/role for that player in their context & how well are they doing it. What does the team need from that said player & has that player done what they needed them to do?

For Herro, it's an easy yes & he's done it extremely well

He's been their engine offensively. You can see in the tracking/usage stats where he ranks on the team. He's been tasked with a lot of responsibility, both as on/off ball scorer, ball handler, passer & help with spacing/shooting. The offense also revolves around his skillset.

Here's a [link to his tracking & usage stats](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-60ewy0xz2yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1807%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De84c5022f0335573f1aeb2c24a8ab3f18a57a0e9) per BBall-Index compared to everyone on the Heat. Leads the team in touches per 75, ball dominance, offensive involvement rate, on-ball action are, true usage, and scoring possessions per 75. 

Even when looking at just the playtypes(PNR/ISO/Post ups/Handoffs), he ranks first by a good margin:

\- Herro: 10.4  
\- Butler: 6.2  
\- Rozier: 5.1  
\- Bam: 4.9

Herro has been doing it all for the Heat. That's a lot of offense going through him & actions directly involving him to score and yet, he's still putting up highly efficient numbers across the board.

The Heat's offensive rating with him on is 115.5 but take him off & it drops to 107.8 - that's the difference between 10th & 29th. Even in this stretch where the Heat's offense had significantly dropped for the year, he still drags it. In 2025, it's 114.1 with vs 106.8 without.

We also seen his production without Butler. In 20 games without Butler, Herro averages 25pts per 75 poss on 57% eFG & 61% TS with 28% usage. His stats & efficiency don't differ. & those points have been needed a lot. When games are in the mud(they have been a lot lately), you'll take any scoring you can get.

Per Cleaning the Glass, the offense is in the 71st percentile with him on and his on/off is in the 96th(!) percentile. Clear impact on the offensive end.

That's third box ticked for me.

Moving onto the ""eye test""(how he does it) and basketball.

Starting off with his shooting. That has been the biggest difference & it comes down to a change in shot diet & upping the 3pt rate. He's an *elite* shooter. He's 12th in 3pt attempts per 100 at 13.5 & shoots 40.5%. Out of 59 qualifying players with 10 3s, he's 13th in %.

Per BBall-Index shooting metrics, he ranks:

\- 7th in 3pt shooting talent  
\- 7th in 3pt pull up talent  
\- 9th in C&S 3pt talent  
\- 1st in deep 3pt talent

\- 2nd in 3pt shot making  
\- 6th in 3pt pull up shot making  
\- 5th in C&S 3pt shot making  
\- 1st in deep 3pt shot making

It's this change in his shot diet for more 3s that got him the 10th highest TS% increase over a single season since 2014, amongst on-ball guards. This year, it was the second highest behind Garland.

He went from a 45.3% 3pt rate to 55.0%. A 10% increase leaning on a skill that he's been *elite* at for the last few years.

He's the only player to rank top 10 in both 3pt pull up & C&S 3pt talent. Deadly on or off ball. There are also only 8 players to rank top 25 in 3pt shot making, pull up shot making & C&S shot making.

& it's that ability to do so in various ways. He can simply be a spot up shooter, helping with the spacing & making him a dangerous off-ball player. He shoots 48% on wide open 3s + 44% on corners. You CAN'T leave him open. His spacing & gravity helps & makes life easier.

[Here's a link to his C&S 3pt & off-ball video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580807857070146)

That off-ball ability & gravity also turns into this. There are multiple instances where he makes the defense panic if comes off a screen or even looks like he's about to go for a 3pt. That's the level of a shooter that he is. This helps with any off-ball movement run for him

[Here's a link to his gravity video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580809929089386)

But it's the handoff + off the dribble where the scoring has taken a jump - he does take 10 PNRs + handoffs combined. Being able to create space for 3s off dribble or off handoffs adds unpredictability. It makes defense have to over play him & he can still get a 3 off in other ways.

[Here's a link to his off dribble 3s video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580812005204320)

That's why his efficiency looks like this. Per BBall-index, his stable PPP:

\- 1.12 points on handoffs  
\- 1.18 on spot ups  
\- 1.24 in transition  
\- 1.10 on off ball screen  
\- 0.94 in PNR

Only 6 other players score at least 1.0 PPP in the first four & 0.9 in the PNR - Dame/Shai/Haliburton/Powell/Pritchard/Edwards

What this all led to is an improvement inside & everywhere else(including his passing). 1st, he took away his inefficient mid-ranges. He's now also shooting 63% within 4ft & 54% within 4-14ft. Out of 64 players with at least 20 2pt per 100, he's 13th in %

The biggest difference is the driving ability & creating off dribble. There's a DRASTIC difference in how aggressive he looks + how he embraced going through contact. There have also been more counters + better moves to shift & get open then burst to the rim.

That's why there's now a more willingness to attack & get to the rim. His rim rate is at 17%(2nd highest in career) - a big improvement from 11% & 13% the last 2 years. Combine that with the shooting, this has been as best of a 3 level scoring season he's ever had

[Here's a link to his drives video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884583295725216122)

What's also been better is the passing & playmaking. That has taken a significant step from last year & has been as big of a difference maker in his impact as everything stated above. This was another major flaw/weakness & it simply isn't like that anymore

Some stats per BBall-Index amongst 93 on-ball players:

\- 23rd in playmaking talent

\- 24th in passing creation quality

\- 21st in box creation

\- 16th in P&R creation rate

There's been a clear increase in volume + responsibility as a passer & that was a needed thing to learn how to balance that with the scoring.

And when you compare him to himself, that's also where you see the drastic improvement. [Here's a link to his tracking passing stats over the last three years](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-ns8j3sx15yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D735%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De2e6168f4471a0a51d010be42925096be56ea87d)!

[Here's a link to his passing off drives & PNR video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884587337503383633)

This is where you see the improved decision making. He's been reading the defense a lot better. And with him being a more willing driver + more aggressive, these windows open up a lot more.

This also has led to him being way more blitzed and the results were better than expected.

[Here's a link to 6 min of him getting blitzed video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884587341236339164)

Finally, let's also touch on the competition. His comp for the 2 backup guards: Cade/Dame/Garland/Ball/Trae/Haliburton/LaVine

[Here are the metrics for all of them.](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-a53owp3n5yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D812%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D65d771e844f1b86ec3d1264f56ab51ca6c8f07e2)

Herro ranks: 5th, tied 4th, 6th, tied 4th, tied 6th, 5th, and 5th

I'd take Herro over Cade & LaVine. & I'd take Garland over Herro 100%. There's little argument for me for either option.

That leaves Hali/Dame/Ball/Trae. All have strong cases over one another & it just depends on preference + what you value more. For me, he is cut short based on the competition with Garland + either Dame/Hali over him. But that also changes nothing about his season.

HE is an All-Star calibre player. He HAS played like an All-Star. With the improvements that he made & how it all has translated for this season, especially considering the circumstances & the situation, he has taken huge steps & growth.

**So, to answer the question, he has played like an All-Star this year**

The Heat have a better record than the Pistons and Hawks, with Herro also being guarded tightly and being leagues above Cade and Trae in scoring 62.2% TS for Tyler vs 54.7% and 55.8% for Young and Cunningham whilst being a good playmaker himself. 

Herro’s stats are similar to Dame, but I give the edge to Herro based on the fact that his team are only three games behind the Bucks while Dame doesn’t have the attention of a first option the other guys do.

LaMelo I don’t think is worth consideration. || He is but there’s like 8 guards that’s are deserving this year which is irritating because the East frontcourt players have been lacking this season. Someone like Jaylen Brown will get an All-Star spot not because he’s played like one but because there isn’t a deep selection of players he’s competing with unlike Herro. || [removed] || When you look at his numbers and the whole butler situation, it feels like he deserves it because now he’s getting the full attention as a number one too. Yet I doubt he finds a spot with the amazing guard play in the east || Herro is playing really well and I would say he is near all star level.  Dame, Young, will be above him.  With the Drama surrounding Butler the coaches will probably take Maxey, Cade, Haliburton or Ball over him as well.  They might also lump Brown in as a guard.

I would put him at near all star and not all star play.  His points are good 24 PPG but not great 25+ or amazing 30+ and his assists are fairly weak at 5.4. He is having a great season and is significantly improved, but he has not been a top 5-6 guard in the East.  Doesn’t mean he isn’t very good though

Edited PPG from typo || I will have to say I was wrong.  I didn’t think Herro would make the.  Congrats to him || My WIGGA Tyler Herro is one of the best pure scorers we’ve ever seen play basketball. His aura is unmatched. || [removed] || [removed] || I'd have him in my wildcard because the east front court is full of undeserving players imo for the wildcards. Especially with how the hawks will be, idk if Trae will make it even though he does deserve it for how insane his playmaking has been.  Main completion is garland, Cade, dame. 


Hali does not deserve it AT ALL no arguments can be made for him imo, his team is playing better because of their defense bye isn't contributing that much too anyways. Ball is hurt, again, and team sucks so those 2 should get him out. I think dame will get in by being dame (not saying my opinion here) so that just leaves maxey and herro and I think herro is more deserving especially since maxey is inefficient || Hero is okay player. No Heat player should be on the All Star team. Heat is sitting at the 7th spot. .500 teams need to focus on winning not sending players to screw off on All Star weekend.
Heat has done Butler wrong! || The Heat also have had the luxury of having Bam and Jimmy (distraction for most of the season)- which is why they have a better record than the Pistons. And the Pistons have beat them twice already.  || Hey. I don’t think his stats are comparable to Damian Lillard. As a second option, Dame is still drawing noticeably more attention than hero (check gravity measurements) and still putting up noticeably higher points per game and assists numbers. Im not really sure your point about them being down by three games and that correlating to herro being better. I do but it’s a very odd point to make.

I strongly disagree. || cade clears. he’s ahead of him in every single stat while having 0 help on his team. this is the same team that was the worse team i. the league and. one of the worst teams ever. and he turned them into a playoff contender. there team records are almost identical so that’s a non factor. cade also draws way more attention than him since his second option is jaden ivey compared to bam adebayo. i also think dame is slightly better but it’s really close and it’s just an opinion thing || Brown is also a proven commodity || Our sub is for in-depth discussion. Low-effort comments or stating opinions as facts are not permitted. Please support your opinions with well-reasoned arguments, including stats and facts as applicable. || Huh? He's averaging 24ppg not 22 and 5.4 assists is great for a natural off guard that shoots a ton. If u watch the games he's being forced to pass early since double teams come as soon as he crosses the half court line. He's also an elite rebounder for his position 

He may or may not be an allstar but it's crazy to say he hasn't played at an all star lvl || Maxey? Lol 

Herro is averaging 24ppg on 62.2% TS. Trae and averaging 55.8% TS and Cade 54.7% TS. Scoring wise, they’re not in the same league. || How does Butler drama have any kind of impact on Herro or coaches decision of choosing him? What a weird argument. || [removed] || We don't allow posts on player rankings or player comparisons on this subreddit. Please read the sticky post for more info. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || cade dame and garland all deserve those spots over him || Jimmy has missed half the season and even actively sandbagged. He’s added a ton of drama with multiple suspensions, which has led to him being suspended. Clearly not a net positive overall

The Pistons did beat us twice. Interestingly enough in one of the two games Miami lost, Herro went 40/5/8 with 1 turnover on 72% Ts compared to Cade’s 21/7/9 with 7 turnovers on 58% TS - highlighting that even when Herro played better than Cade, thr results may not reflect it. || Jimmy hasnt played this season so calling that a luxury is hilarious, not to mention how putrid Bam has been on offense, teams literally don't guard bam. You should check out some Heat games to get a better look at Herro imo || - Dame 25/5/7 62% TS
- Herro 24/6/5 62% TS

Pretty comparable numbers in my view. Herro is a first option though, so I give him more credit. I wouldn’t say a ppg difference of 1.2ppg is noticeably higher.

I think being a 48 win pace team is quite an underachievement for an All Star playing with a multiple time MVP in their prime, so I don’t give too much credit there. || Bam isn’t a very good offensive player, he’s not much better than Jarrett Allen. Jaden Ivey is a much better 3pt shooter and more reliable shot creator than Bam. || Are we rewarding guys because they’re “proven” or because they deserve it? It’s not like he’s a legend where you can award him with a legacy All-Star nod like Steph, LeBron. And it’s not like he was a top vote getter from the fans. Brown is literally gonna get his nod this year because his competition is weak but he doesn’t deserve it by his play. || You’re right I mistyped points.

5.4 assists is not great.  I am putting him at near all star level which is still great.  It’s not like I am saying he is garbage or stat padding. || Maxey is averaging 27 and 6 assists. Do you think all-star voters pay that much attention to TS over pts/reb/assists when it comes time to slot guys into the game?",0.0,0.619,0.381,0.5106,0.041,0.816,0.143,0.9994,0.104,0.755,0.141,0.9961

[OC Analysis],"*Hi folks -- apologies for the length, I thought this would end up being shorter than it ended up being. Hope you enjoy!*

As we fully and truly enter the NBA’s efficiency era, one thing that gets tricky to talk about are the efficiency numbers of past NBA greats. The league average True Shooting Percentage (which takes 3-pointers and free throws into account) this season is 57.4%. That’s an unbelievably high mark compared to past years. In 2014-15, the league average TS% was at 53.4%, and in 03-04, the last year before the hand-check rule change, it was down at 51.6%. 

As stated above, this can make talking about past greats tough. Kobe’s career True Shooting is at 55.0%. In the 05-06 season where he averaged 35.4 points and infamously lost a close race with LeBron for the MVP to Steve Nash, his True Shooting was 55.9%, which would put him among the bottom third of NBA teams. MJ’s career TS% was 56.9%. In 1997-98, he won MVP with a TS% of 53.3% – the Wizards’ current TS% of 54.0 is the worst in the league. Kareem was hyper-efficient during his career, with a TS% of 59.2%, but even that doesn’t match Kenny Atkinson’s Cavs and their 61.4% True Shooting this season. In short, it was really, really hard for players who didn’t shoot a lot of threes to match the efficiency of players who do, especially if they relied heavily on midrange shots – that extra point just matters so much. 

(Tangent: to illustrate this, I got curious last week and ran the numbers on LeBron and Kobe’s career points per jump shot. I went onto basketball-reference and multiplied their career FGAs by % of shots taken from 10-15 feet and 16-23 feet to get the data on their midrange jumpers – since they work in percentages, there were decimal points where there shouldn’t have been and the results may therefore be off by a percentage point or two. 

Still, here’s the breakdown. Kobe took 4,506 shots \[again, give or take one or two\] from 10-15 feet, and made 41.1% of them. He took 7,100 shots from 16-23 feet, and made 40.2% of them. He shot 1827-5546 from three-point range. That’s 14,894 points on 17,153 shots, or .874 points per shot – that comes out to an eFG% of 43.42%. 

LeBron, as of January 21st, 2025, had taken 2,875 shots from 10-15 feet and made 36.8% of them. He took 5,451 shots from 16-23 feet, making 38.6% of them. He had shot 2,492-7,130 from 3-point range. That’s 13,800 points on 15,457 shots, which comes out to .892 points per shot, an eFG% of 44.6%. 

So Kobe, a virtuosic midrange shooter capable of hitting shot after shot over every coverage imaginable, loses out efficiency-wise to LeBron because LeBron, despite having an iffy midrange shot for a lot of his career, took a considerably higher rate of 3s and made them at a slightly higher clip. “Objectively,” I have very little doubt in my mind that Kobe was a better shooter than LeBron – heck, you can see that at the free throw line – but the power of that extra point is undeniable. 

Also, even though LeBron’s shot diet was more “modern” than Kobe’s, all those years taking so many mid-range shots still drags him down compared to the current jump shot diet – if you shoot 29.73% from 3-point range and don’t take any from the midrange, you’re clearing LeBron’s career efficiency on shots outside of 10 feet.) 

Sorry, that was a long tangent. I kinda feel like “LeBron has been more efficient on shots outside of 10 feet than Kobe” was too inflammatory to live on its own, so I hid it in here. Anyways, I want to get to the bottom of my feelings about viewing historic greats through a modern efficiency lens through three takes – a good one, a “maybe” one, and an iffy one. To start, let’s talk about Tetris. 

**Part 1: Larry Bird and Tetris Innovation**

The first take we’ll look at is one I think is fair – Larry Bird, despite having 3-point numbers that pale in comparison to those of modern players, should be considered a great 3-point shooter, and it’s totally fair to assume he would have made threes at a much higher volume if he’d played in a later era. 

I’m [running a bit counter to JJ Redick here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK_Bq-gxQQU), even though I loved JJ Redick as a member of the media and don’t think he was “wrong,” per se, when he called out Bird’s standing as a potential top-5 three-point shooter. Yes, Larry Bird only made 649 career threes – Steph Curry made 402 in the 15-16 season alone. Yes, he shot 71-276 (25.7%) from deep between 1980 and 1984. He’s 184th all-time in three-point percentage, and not close to the top 250 for 3-pointers made. And yes, [he wasn’t working quite as hard to get his looks from 3-point range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eee2TkiclIM) as players do today. However, context matters, and this is where Tetris comes into play. 

For years and years, Jonas Neubauer stood as Tetris’ undisputed GOAT. He won the Classic Tetris World Championship 7 times between 2010 and 2017, and was runner-up in 2014 and 2018. He claimed to be the first player ever to achieve a “max-out” score of 999,999 (there is some controversy surrounding this), and in 2018 set the record with a high score of 1,245,200. 

However, despite his obvious mastery of a game that came out in 1989, there was something very important Jonas didn’t know about Tetris. So far as Jonas or anyone else knew, it was only possible to go so far in a game of Tetris before the “kill screen” – the pieces would move so fast it was physically impossible to maneuver them, and the game would end shortly after a player reached level 29 and the speed of the pieces doubled. 

As it turns out, however, it wasn’t impossible – it was just impossible for Jonas. He, like everyone else, believed the fastest way to move a piece was to hold the button down. When you do that, the built-in lag is too strong for anyone to play at the speeds required for level 29. In 2018, it became widely known that you can “hypertap” the controller to get around that lag and play past level 29, and in 2020 players figured out a way to roll the controller in their hands to achieve ludicrous speeds previously thought literally impossible. 

When players figured that out, Jonas’ records got absolutely demolished. Players were able to reach levels in the hundreds, one (“Blue Scuti”) got to level 157 and made the game crash, and, in October of 2024, a player (“dogplayingtetris”) on a crash-resistant version of the game got past level 255 and reached “rebirth,” when the game starts itself over again. The current Tetris high-score record stands at 16,700,760 points. ([The modern history of Tetris is fascinating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOJlg8g8_yw).) 

Here’s the point: I don’t take anything away from Jonas for not knowing about hypertapping. When players who have gotten scores beyond anything Jonas could have dreamed of face each other at the CWTC now, they play for the Jonas Neubauer trophy, and that’s how it should be. And just like we shouldn’t hold Jonas responsible for playing before anyone knew the power of hypertapping, we shouldn’t hold Larry Bird responsible for playing before anyone truly knew the power of the three-point shot. (Yes, “maybe we should take the jump shot that counts for 50% more points” is perhaps a shorter intuitive leap than “let’s see what happens if I mash the absolute crap out of a button on a controller that hasn’t been widely used for two decades,” but that’s besides the point.) 

When Larry Bird played, he used the three-point line as much as anyone thought it was possible to. It was introduced to the NBA in Bird’s rookie year, and averaging approximately one made three per game functioned as the NBA’s version of level 29 – go any further than that, and an efficiency “kill screen” was thought to be inevitable. Larry led the league in 3s made twice and shot better than 40% from deep six times. When they held the first-ever three-point contest, Larry won it by getting 73.33% of the possible points – when Curry won the contest in 2021, he got 70% of the possible points. After that, Bird won the next two contests. 

Relative league stats also help show just how far ahead of his time Bird was – his career 3P+ (his field goal percentage relative to the league, with 100 being average) was 127, higher than Curry’s career mark of 119. His 3Pr+, his rate of threes relative to the league, was a mind-bending 227. (Again, for comparison, Curry’s is at “only” 165.) That’s not to say Bird was a better shooter than Curry – league-relative stats aren’t a magic bullet, and they can underrate current players, who are playing extremely close to the efficiency “ceiling.” It used to be possible to ""hack"" your way to great relative efficiency by cutting midrange shots out -- [I wrote about it when Kevin Martin did it all the way back in 2009.](https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/6923/kevin-martin-the-adam-dunn-of-the-nba) Now that everyone has a much better shot diet, those edges are a lot harder to find. However, Bird was a shooting Bonjwa, he deserves his flowers as one of the best of all time, and it’s totally fair to imagine he would have drained a lot more threes in a later era. Now let’s get a bit trickier. 

**Part 2: Kevin Garnett and the Ship of Theseus** 

The second take (“thesis statement,” if you prefer to be fancy) we’ll examine is “Kevin Garnett would have been a ton better in the modern era,” which I actually have mixed feelings about. 

I’ve said before that Kevin Garnett was tragically ahead of his time, and it would have been amazing to see what he would have done now, when big men have so much more freedom to make plays and shoot from distance. Despite a great stroke, Garnett spotted up from 20 feet away, because that’s where even “stretchy” four-men were supposed to stand. Despite all his skill with the ball, he spent much of his prime toiling away in the efficiency desert of the mid-post. In his MVP season, where he was doing most of his work from that area, his True Shooting was 54.7% – only the Pelicans, Hornets, Magic, and Wizards are posting a worse mark than than this season. In the 07-08 season, a full 57% of his shots were from midrange, and 36.5% were from 16-23 feet. Even though he knocked those shots down at a spectacular rate, hitting 48.8% from 10-15 feet and 48.2% from 16-23 feet, those shots would have been better-taken if he had been willing/allowed/expected to step behind the line and hit just a third of them. 

It’s easy to say that the guy who took the entire 2000 Olympic team in one-on-ones should have been allowed to show the full volume of his skill in a more spread-out offense, and it probably would have looked a lot better on the stat sheet. But would that have actually made Garnett a better player, or more fun to watch. Yes, those mid-post possessions were inefficient compared to what modern offenses do, but everyone was doing it at the time, and KG was really, really good at it. Those long twos helped his team win a championship. (The Celtics and Lakers meeting in the finals on the backs of midrange masters with the Seven Seconds or Less Suns and the Beautiful Game Spurs laying the foundation for what the league would become was a real “John Henry beats the Steam Shovel” moment in NBA history.)

I think sometimes about if Kevin Durant would have been more effective in an old “meta” where the mid-range was king. He certainly doesn’t have trouble scoring efficiently in the spaced-out NBA, but his accuracy from midrange and ability to get a midrange shot from his spot whenever he wants it is almost unmatched in league history. It’s easy to say everyone taking midrange shots instead of 3s was running a marathon with a lead backpack on from an efficiency standpoint, but what does it do to the guys who are great at adjusting to the weight of that backpack? 

Also, the Ship of Theseus comes into play here. If Kevin Garnett had come up in modern times, his long twos would have been threes – that’s easy enough to imagine. And he would have gotten a lot more easy dunks in pick-and-roll. Also, he would have come up in a post-Durant era, and had a lot more freedom to handle the ball, and would have done more work facing up instead of in the mid-post…and at some point, *he wouldn’t have been Kevin Garnett.* The Kevin Garnett we got may not have been the most “optimized” version of him, but he played in the style of his time while pushing the envelope in terms of what big men could do as far as he could push it. Should that be enough? I’m not sure, which is why I have more mixed feelings about this take than something like “it’s very easy to imagine Larry Bird making a lot of threes in the modern era.”

**Part 3: Michael Jordan and Occam’s Razor**

After a thesis I find very reasonable and one I have mixed feelings about, let’s move onto one that I see a lot and think is pretty silly – “Michael Jordan would have been a great three-point shooter if he played today, he just played in a time when players didn’t take those so he didn’t care about it.” 

So here’s what we know. Michael Jordan was an amazing basketball player and historically great midrange shooter. I actually think MJ was the greatest player of all time, which I suppose makes me somewhat of a heretic as someone who is also a card-carrying LeBron homer, but I also feel uncomfortable amongst the MJ fanbase because I prefer to talk about the actual Michael Jordan instead of the imaginary one. (Here’s a tangent: MJ’s DPOY season was *ludicrous.* He averaged a league-leading 3.2 steals per game and had 1.6 blocks per game as a shooting guard. LeBron’s career-high for blocks per game is 1.1. *He had more steals than turnovers that season.* Who did he beat for the award? The #2 vote-getter was Mark Eaton, who led the league in blocks. The #3 vote-getter was Hakeem, whom the DPOY trophy is named after now. And he deserved it! He was tied with Hakeem in “stocks,” the Bulls had a better defensive rating than the Rockets, and Jordan was essentially tied with Hakeem in DWS and destroyed him in DBPM. Michael Jordan was incredible.)

However, MJ was not great at shooting 3s. He shot 32.7% from 3 over his career, and he really benefited from the shorter 3-point line – if you take those seasons out, he was a 28.8 shooter from deep. Even taking the league into account, he wasn’t great – his career 3p+ was a below-average 95, and his 3PAr+ was just 71, which is especially low considering guards were taking nearly all of the threes back in those times. He actually participated in a three-point contest once, and posted [the worst score in NBA history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr-NKGIg5BQ).

This is where you’ll run into a viral clip of [MJ saying in an interview that actually, he didn’t want to be great at threes](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vigL3Z9mt1Y), because he would fall too much in love with it and it would take away from the strength of his game, which is attacking the basket. 

Let’s drill down on that one a bit, because it gets cited a lot. First off, MJ loved the shorter line. In his two full seasons with it, he shot 260 and 297 threes, which were both career-high marks – when they moved the line back the next season, he only shot 126. So a shot from 23 feet and 9 inches takes away from attacking the basket, but one from 22 feet doesn’t? 

Also, the post-baseball version of MJ, which is the only version we have tracking data on, actually wasn’t a particularly aggressive basket attacker – in 96-97, 18% of his shots were from within 3 feet, and in 97-98 22.1% of his shots came at the rim. The league, as a whole, took 34.1% of its shots from 0-3 feet in 96-97, and 28.6% of the league’s shots were at the rim in 97-98. Sure, a lot of the looks he got from midrange were set up with the threat of the drive, but that doesn’t seem like enough driving to justify voluntarily giving up a three-point shot, and a lot of his shots came from post-ups in that era. (It should be noted that this is post-baseball MJ, and it looks like that interview clip was from the earlier years.) Also, he wouldn’t at least have tried to extend his range in the Wizards years, when he took less than 14% of his shots at the rim? 

It’s worth mentioning we’re talking about Michael Jordan here. He became a near-professional level golfer because he was mad his college roommate Davis Love III could hit the ball further than him. He would get furious when Christian Laettner beat him at ping-pong on the Dream Team. In 1988, Jordan averaged 35 points per game, won MVP, and also got the aforementioned DPOY award. He threw quarters close to a wall. In 1989, he came to Tim Grover to overhaul his body and training. That’s the guy who said “The three-point shot? The thing I do once per game? The thing I shot 1,778 times in my career? Nah, that’s not worth being good at, I won’t waste my time practicing that.” 

At some point, Occam’s Razor comes into play and I have an easier time believing “the guy who took nearly 2,000 threes and hit a low percentage of them wasn’t very good at them, and may have had enough of an ego to create a self-serving explanation for that weakness in an interview” than “MJ didn’t feel like becoming good threes.” 

This is the part where we mention that MJ focusing on midrange shooting worked very, very well. The Bulls won 69 games in 96-97, 62 games in 97-98, and won the championship both years. It was remarked upon by the media at the time and continues to be mentioned. MJ had a flat stroke that was perfect for mid-range shots, especially with the way he could control it in off-balance situations and over tough coverages, and it allowed him to absolutely dominate a league with a heavy emphasis on mid-range shooting. You can only play in your era, and MJ was perfect for his. That doesn’t roll off the tongue as smoothly as “MJ is the best and he would have no problem being the best in a different way,” but it feels closer to the truth. 

If he had come along today, he probably would have developed a shot with more arc that would have given him more range, but then he wouldn’t have been the Michael Jordan that we got, who was the best NBA player of all time. Also, there are no guarantees on anything – Giannis, Zion Williamson, and other guys were still able to exist in this era, after all. In 20 years, are we going to say “well, if Giannis had been in today’s game, he obviously would have been a great three-point shooter?” Again, the big point is that the actual Michael Jordan should be good enough to appreciate without having to make up a fantasy superhero Michael Jordan that’s good at something the real one never showed any real signs of being great at. 

Alright, it’s well past time to wrap this whole thing up. Modern efficiency has made it very hard to compare players across eras, at least on paper. Almost every great player from the past would likely play the game at least a little bit, if not very, differently, in today’s environment. Sometimes the adjustments we make to past performance, like that the best shooter of his generation would have done well if asked to shoot more, are extremely reasonable. Others are less so, and we don’t want to lose sight of what made players great against the opponents actually faced when trying to fit them into a theoretical modern NBA and compare them with players who are playing a different game.  ",63,36,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1icq4x7/how_should_we_judge_the_shot_diets_of_the_past_oc/,2025-01-29 04:35:25,"This is tremendous content for this sub so thank you for putting this together. I generally agree with you regarding how we should value past achievements in their historical context, but I suspected you would find resistance, and it appears you did. IMO once you start imagining more nuanced and hypothetical situations such as how a player might do in another era, you leave the realm of objective verifiable discourse. Everyone is going to think their take on the matter is the right one, because people don’t like to think their logic isn’t sound, and there isn’t enough data to definitively say one way or another. So while I agree that MJ was pathologically competitive at everything and of course he wanted to be good at 3s, someone else is going to say there’s no reason to think MJ couldn’t have fixed his arc with a modern shot doctor while still remaining lethal from midrange. And they’re going to be just as correct. Still, it’s fun to conjecture, which is good for this sub. 

A few nitpicks- there was an article going around in the last year or two outlining the insane degree of home cooking MJ was receiving on defense in those early years, and a brief look at his home and road splits would support that. In 88 he averaged a mind boggling 4 spg and 2bpg at home against a still solid but nowhere near as impressive 2 and 1 on the road.

Also, I’m not convinced Kobe was a better shooter than LeBron.  He probably was. His style of fadeaway triple teamed daggers to break his opponent’s will probably didn’t help his percentages. But his form was a bit old school, and his last four healthy years he was approaching Westbrook level inefficiency from deep. LeBron has never been a particularly good shooter, but he’s spent the second half of his career being an average one. You can point to their FT%, but occasionally that doesn’t tell the whole story.

I hope you keep posting here. Good stuff || There are definitely fans who value efficiency that did not see Kobe play in his heyday, and are underwhelmed by his stats looking back. But his shot selection (especially relative to the option of feeding Shaq more) was questioned his entire career by media, fans, his own coaches and teammates that didn't have any idea what true shooting percentage was. So I don't think it's suddenly unfair to question it now just because we have different and better tools for looking at it. Some of those tools even reflect favorably upon him, when you examine how he elevated the team offense including in the playoffs and the way he scaled with other good players.

It is interesting to think that from 1979 to 2015, cross era statistical comparisons really only had to adjust for pace. League average offensive rating and true shooting percentage were basically stable that that entire time. I think with some different rules enforcement that could have even maintained through the three point shooting surge. I think it's still the fairest way to do it if you had to, but I don't like that we now have to use layers of abstraction like adjusting true shooting percentage for what the league average was at the time. || I'll admit i didn't make it all the way through your post but I'm not sure why you'd compare Kobes true shooting to modern teams rather than to the same season?  He was 51st in TS% that season so still not terribly efficient.  Great shooter or not i think Kobe gets a knock for his poor shot selection, something that became really pronounced in his later years.  He was notorious for waving off open teammates and shooting his shot good or bad, sort of the anti LeBron in that sense.  So he might have a better stroke than LeBron but did it matter? || The shot profile of today's game has been echoed throughout history, it's just difficult to replicate as players with less talent or mismanaged teams (sorry Cade) try to carry the load without the support needed.

Whenever this topic gets brought up, I always like to bring up two players - Reggie Miller and Manu Ginobili. Reggie Miller was the prototype for Steph Curry, and Manu Ginobili for Harden. (Fun fact; Reggie's lowest TS% was at around 58%!!!, it was in his rookie year and last year in the league; while Manu's peaked at 61 in 2007-08). I would argue, that these two were outliers in their respective generations, which supports your thesis.  
  
I do think today's spacing will inflate some of the modern era's numbers (and that's not a bad thing). Although not really what you're trying to do, but when comparing against eras, I propose to just start with how much better was Player X compared to the average player in his era? vs other similar performers in his era? That should normalise some noise, but its not perfect. || BTW, I believe this is the point I'm allowed to plug my Substack -- you can find this post and others like it at [(5) Krolik's Corner | John Krolik | Substack](https://johnkrolik.substack.com/?r=yw64&utm_campaign=subscribe-page-share-screen&utm_medium=web) if you're so inclined. Take a look around, maybe even subscribe if you're feeling feisty, it's free! || This is a bit of a tangent, but I don't know where else to post it. I find Larry Bird's three point shooting evolution over his career fascinating.

As a rookie, he attempted 1.7 threes per game and made .406. This is outstanding.

But then for his next four seasons, he inexplicably reduced his three point volume to less than one attempt per game, and only made around 25%.

And then in his sixth season he started shooting more threes again (1.6 per game) and made .427. For the rest of his career, he increased his volume even more and mostly stayed over 40%. 

So, what happened in years 2-5? I can think of a couple of possibilities:

1. His rookie season was fool's gold. Maybe he just had great shooting luck in in his rookie year, and his actual expected three point percentage was in the 20s. Then he reverted back to expectations in seasons 2-5. Finally, in season 6 he improved his three point shooting to an elite level (for the time period, at least).

2. He really was an elite three point shooter right from the start. But in seasons 2-5, for some reason his coach told him to stop shooting threes. So he stopped shooting threes in the normal flow of the game. However, since he was the star player, he was responsible for taking most of his team's heaves, ""grenades,"" end-of-shot-clock attempts, and desperation end-of-game shots. With such a low volume of attempts, his three point shot diet was dominated by these low-quality shots. This actually seems more plausible to me than the first hypothesis. Under this scenario, we can speculate about how Bird would have performed with increased three-point volume. Typically we assume that a player's efficiency will be reduced with increased volume, as the player's additional shots are lower-quality than their current average. But in Bird's case, he had such a low volume that the low quality shots discussed above may have actually significantly harmed his efficiency even in his more prolific shooting years (he maxed out at 3.3 attempts per game). So it is plausible that with increased volume, his three point percentage would have actually increased. || Fun fact about Larry Bird: He had more games where he didn’t make any three pointers than games where he made any

I’d agree for sure that he was amazing in his era and that if he was born forty years later he would’ve done things differently and probably made many more, but that’s to me akin to saying “if my aunt had wheels she’d be a bicycle”. He had the same three point line in the 80s, had arguably easier shooting conditions, knew you could take threes at volume (he had 10 attempts multiple times), and still made 649 at 38%. For his time, this is excellent, now it’s not. 

Your Tetris comparison doesn’t hold water here in my opinion, there was no new discovery. Nobody found out that standing in a certain spot your 3P% doubled or something, it’s the same shot that has always existed. Celebrate the players in their era but you can’t really make cross era comparisons, this has been JJ’s point as well || [removed] || Reggie's a guy who modern stats definitely look favorably upon, and there were guys like Kevin Martin who were unappreciated shot-diet pioneers -- the question of ""how much should we penalize guys for accepting conventional wisdom when they had peers who didn't"" is one I don't have a definitive answer for. (TS+ and other stats like it, which I mentioned in the Bird part, do provide a lot of help, but are far from perfect.) || I've been thinking a lot about the Ship of Theseus recently in an entirely different context - the AD trade.

Essentially I'm not sure how Mavs fans could have any attachment to this team when none of their key players have been there more than two years.

Anyway, great post. || Yeah I didn’t have much time to drill down on it, this post was more than long enough as is, but I also found that fascinating. His rookie year was also the 3pt line’s first year in the NBA. || Bird shot more 3PTA (3.1) in his 1988 season than Dirk Nowitzki shot (2.2) during his 2007 MVP season. And he shot it at 41% that season, basically the same rate as Dirk Nowitzki shot in 2007.

Both he and Nowitzki have the same career shooting percentages from 3PT at 38% but for whatever reason I never have to hear that obsessional nitpicking that Dirk didn't shoot enough from three for his era or questions about whether he could play today. || Well that's the gist of parts 2 and 3, so I'm picking up what you're putting down. Maybe I was a bit too timid about not going after players for not taking more agency in their shot selection, but ""the three is a gimmick and it's impossible to make them at high volume"" was heavily entrenched dogma in Bird's time. But your point is well taken, it's not like he (or KG or MJ, for that matter) was gonna get benched if he'd taken five a game. || Not u stealing that bicycle joke, have some shame lmao || The value of the 3 actually is kind of a new discovery, the result of analytics that didn't exist in the era of Bird. We all knew 3 points is more than 2. But people didn't grasp how to leverage that, much like people didn't understand that Tetris trick.

For decades, there was the phrase ""Live by the 3, die by the 3."" It was widely believed that winning basketball and high volume 3 pointers were incompatible because of wide variance in performance. You may get hot and win a game. But you may go cold and lose it. So if you want to win, are you taking the sure thing, or that risky 3? 

Even past the era of Bird, some of the most famous 3 point shooting games have not been the positive type. John Starks going 0-11 from 3 in game 7 is seared into the heads of Knicks fans. That sort of unpredictability is exactly why teams and players shied away from it. || [removed] || Free throws are a big part of it, sure, but to be clear Kobe's eFG% was higher than league average on an extremely tough shot diet for the majority of his prime. Even in his 35 PPG season he was at league average eFG%. || Nah, Kobe was a great finisher relative to era. %’s around the rim have increased dramatically in recent years. || So I came up writing for LA publications and am naturally a Kobe skeptic -- I learned early on that a spoonful (or truckful) of sugar is pretty necessary for the medicine to go down when it comes to talking about Kobe (or MJ, for that matter.) || I’m sure Bird could play today, the greats all could. My quibble is more with considering him an alltime great shooter. I wouldn’t say Dirk is either || The analytics of 3X0.376 > 2X0.509 (in the case of Bird) was there the whole time, it’s pretty simple math. It’s different than the Tetris trick described because people literally didn’t know that existed. Not doing simple math is not the same thing

I think the phrase you mentioned still persists today, as 3pt shooting does have a lot of variance. Think about the Rockets finishing their game shooting 0/27 against the Warriors in game 7. I don’t think winning basketball was ever at odds with shooting 3s, it was just known to be a riskier play || Please do not attack the person, their post history, or their age as a proxy for disagreeing with their opinions. || Mid 30s, I never watched Bird play. I’m well aware that the game was played differently in the 80s, but the rules weren’t significantly different in any way. Should I give Bird credit for falling in line with the status quo? || Back then, we could count to three and even do percentages. 

Although the league can be slow in adapting changes, I don’t think this was it. A 3p specialist, like Tracy Murray, could get up to 40% some seasons. It wasn’t viable because it was unreliable and teams would defend it more in the playoffs. 
«Jump shooting teams» had never won any rings for a reason, not some arbitrary conventional wisdom. || IDK about ""great,"" career 63.7% finisher when the average during the time he played was 61.4%. Certainly respectable though, especially for a guard/wing. || He still has some of the highest scoring rounds in the 3PT contest I believe, if that means anything. || But the Tetris trick was always there, the same as the numbers for 3's. It's the same situation where people didn't see a solution that was there the whole time. I mean, people didn't realize you could hit a button twice to increase efficiency for 30 years? That seems just as glaring as the 3's. Especially with the headwinds against the 3 based off from conventional wisdom. That's why I would say that comparison holds up.

That Rockets game is different in terms of context and the common discourse around the 3. That game was after Curry and the Warriors showed you could win a title by the 3. As well as the previous year of beautiful basketball by the Spurs. And your last point about it being a riskier play is exactly why the best teams would be hesitant to rely on it. If you can win consistently, why introduce variables that could hurt as much as help? Especially when there were more glaring instances of it hurting you?

And I forgot to address your point about Bird's 3P% being less than optimal today: even if we ignore Bird practicing the 3 more, there is another factor at play when accounting for those numbers. With the 3 revolution, teams specifically design plays to get open 3's. If Bird's coaches weren't actively scheming to get him open 3's, his numbers will look different than a modern player who benefits from that. || He was consistently well above league average for his position, for the vast majority of his career. +2.3 rEfficiency for a guy who was also above average from 3-23 feet is excellent. || I think Bird is an all-timer in terms of shooting. But I really don't think the small sample size controlled conditions of a 3 point contest are the points of proof we should look to. I think the eye test, looking at Bird's shooting form, things along those lines are the angles we should pursue for Bird. || He’s tied for 9th, tied for 31st, and tied for 35th in terms of percentage among out of 38 winners alltime.

LeBron James,"""Lebron James"" OR ""King James"" OR ""Bron"" OR ""Lebron"" OR ""Bron Bron"" OR ""LBJ""",2025-01-28,nbadiscussion,1ic2mtz,"No, it's not recency bias, Jokic is that good.","This season, Jokic is currently averaging 30.3/13.1/10.2, putting him 3rd in scoring, 3rd in rebounding, and 2nd in assists. Meanwhile he is averaging 65.7% TS, making him the 2nd most efficient volume scorer (players scoring at least 20.0 ppg), behind only Sabonis. Oh yeah and he's the third most efficient 3 point shooter in the league hitting 47.4% of his attempts. That is a mind bogglingly impressive box score. You could very seriously  argue that Jokic is the only player in NBA history to simultaneously be the best scorer, play maker, and rebounder in the world.

Throughout NBA history, there have been exactly 5 individual season where an individual recorded a BMP of 13.0 or higher. 1 was LeBron in 2008-09, the other 4 were all Jokic. This season he is on pace to break his own record, with a BMP of 14.23.  Yes, BMP can be a flawed stat, but the individuals with top 10 BMP seasons not named Jokic are Michael Jordan (3 times), LeBron James (once), and Steph Curry (once). That is a very, very good list to be a part of.

My last point is that off of vibes I've gotten watching basketball over the last few years is that it has felt like Jokic has been the best basketball player in the world for the last 4 years . How many all time greats over the  last several decades could really claim to have been the best player in the league for 4+ years? Not many. MJ, LeBron, Kareem. Maybe, Shaq, Magic or Tim Duncan.  

  
My point is, that Jokic is that guy. Not only is he awesome, he is historically awesome. It is not ridiculous to consider him to be amongst the greatest centers to ever live, and you should not dismiss him simply because his team didn't win a team award as often as others.",873,316,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ic2mtz/no_its_not_recency_bias_jokic_is_that_good/,2025-01-28 09:22:34,"This post is mostly focused on defining the abilities of a single player, which is great. Unfortunately, the comments focusing on ranking that player, got rapidly uncivil and focused on measuring egos instead of sharing insights. 

Post can remain as an exception to our rules but comments are locked. || Peak-for-peak he has a pretty good case for being the best offensive player ever. I would also say he has a top 10 peak of all-time.

We don’t need to jump the gun on career discussions for him though. It’s not just a rings thing, it’s longevity too. Most guys in that top 12 range have 12+ years of elite play. Jokić has only been star-caliber for 7-8 years. He’ll naturally get his due as his career progresses. || I might be early but for me he’s the best centre I’ve ever seen, I didn’t get to see all of Shaq’s prime but i only remember the later years. Jokic didn’t play with Kobe or D Wade either, even his co star can be inconsistent but there’s no doubt he makes almost everyone a better player, look at Russ this season for example. || Definitely not arguing with the title, but pulling up stats are kind of pointless. Efficiency stats when comparing eras just don't make sense. And the reason his BPM is so historic is the team is appalingly bad when he is not on the court. Now that usually happens when you have a superstar because the rest of the team is cramped with the salary cap. When salaries weren't as crazy in the 70s/80s, teams always had built out rosters. So you didn't see teams cratering when the star was off the court like you do in the Lebron/Steph/Jokic era.

  
Again, I think he's historically great. To crack the GOAT tier discussion, he'll need to win a few more championships. May not be fair to him in the era of parity, but those are the breaks. || The only pushback I’d give is that I don’t think Jokic was the consensus best player in the league until 2023.  A lot of people had Giannis over him until the 2023 title run.  Now of course we can just argue that’s due to winning bias (I’m not sure Jokic got appreciably better between 2022 and 2023, his team was just better), I’m just saying idk if it’s fair to say he’s been the consensus best player for the last 4 seasons.

It's actually crazy || Jokic has highest 3 point percentage cause he actually has around 15 heaves this season, if not for those he would would be above 50% || The only thing that matters is championships.

He's got one which definitely helps his cause.   If he didn't win one,   I would put him in a different category with Malone or Barkley. || Agree.

I've watched NBA on and off for 35 years and both the eye test and the stats are in agreement, he is a generational big man. As long as he stays healthy and reproduces his current form for a decent number of years he is on track to finish his career as one of the ten greatest players of all time.

Trying to rank him against other all time greats is dificult for the same reason Bird is tough to rank- joker is just so fucking perfect offensively that it papers over any other cracks in his game. || His peak could still be going for few more years
He doesn’t rely on being athletic he only falls off when his focus is off || Agreed with most the comments he is the best offensive player ever

Jokic has a great case but there is a reason when we talk top 5 any position or top 5 centers they all have DEFENSE || Just going to add that if you removed end of the quarter heaves, which Jokic leads the league in, then I believe he is the most efficient 3 point shooter in the league. || [removed] || He is on a five year run that is at least ARGUABLY better than anyone else’s. And the years before his numbers were still all nba level. At some we have accept that super efficient scoring, wonder passing and dominant rebounding combined with the most team oriented mindset possible probably will make you a legendary player. I think he’s better at the game than Magic or Bird. We are watching a phenomenal player in his prime. In the same way as I accepted Steph was the GOAT shooter quite early in his career I now accept that Denver had a top 10 player of all time. Things improve and people get better at playing games it’s only to be expected that a 2025 player might  do some things that weren’t being done in 05 or 95. I think we should all enjoy it. || Giannis is right there with him if not better. Defense is a thing in the NBA. || Comparing players across eras is dumb especially if you don't have a clear cut criteria. Plus anything you judge a player on is based around their teammates rather it's stats, awards or winning everything is skewed by how good or bad your teammates are and the fit put around the best player. || Yep. We’re watching a basketball savant. He’s the most bizarre super talent I’ve ever seem.

Make your own top 10 with what you know, dont be a sheep || [removed] || Ok, let's discuss. 

Yes, Jokic is that good, for all the statistical reasons you listed... And, he did finally lead his team to a very elusive title, and has a good amount of accolades. 
But, what does that mean?

A lot of the NFL world seems ready to crown Patrick mahomes the goat, for potentially winning 3 super bowls in a row. Why? Cuz there, they understand the importance of winning, over statistical achievements. 
Yes, the NFL is different, and due to winner take all playoff formats, it's harder to win 3 in a row. I'll give you all of that. 

Bringing it back to the NBA... What criticism is often levied against Wilt Chamberlain, for his goat case? He didn't win enough. I can provide all sorts of context and history, regarding the Bill Russell superteams, and lack of free agency and post injury Wilt and blah blah... But, at the end of the day, he didn't get it done, despite his ridiculous list of all time records (which are even smaller than they should be, cuz certain stats weren't even counted when he played...)

Winning matters, is the point. It shouldn't be your end all, be all... But, it matters. 

And in that category, we need to pump the brakes a little bit for Jokic.

Then there's the recency bias issue, of trying to put the proper context around Jokic in this era, and trying to compare that to previous era's---which is already a fools errand in many ways. But, the entire play style of the league is very different. The rules are different. Positionless basketball is a very new concept. Centers of the past trained their entire lives to play in those styles and systems. David Robinson is a GREAT center---but recency bias, stats, and analytics will never give him the credit he deserves. They also won't add any context or history, of him consistently playing against other great centers. 

Your comparing a guy, with an insane usage rate, in a positionless league, who has the ball in his hands all the time, and basically makes all the decisions on the floor... To players of the past, that had roles, played in systems, were generally less ball dominant, etc, had to rely on point guards to get them the ball, where high scoring point guards were anomalies... These are the areas where recency bias will tell you Jokic is ""SO MUCH BETTER"" than everyone before... When it's more complicated than that. 

Also, it's an inflated era. The commissioner has admitted, on camera, rules were changed intentionally to make scoring easier. Pace and more 3s makes it easier for rebound opportunities, and not just for centers anymore. There's no physicality in the league. Assists are given out like candy now. Freedom of movement and carrying/lack of travels makes it easier for everyone... The spacing has never been so wide open... The center position has NEVER been so physically weak, out of necessity, to keep up with modern offenses.

So ya... Admire what he's doing. But no, he's not goat center yet, he's not top 15 already...

Damn... Let his have his career. Recency bias and analytics are frothing at the mouth to put all these players right now in goat conversations and put them as all time greats, before they've even put in the real work. || Not Magic for 4 years. Bird though for sure 

3 MVP
5 runner ups in 8 years || My only contention with his placements among the offensive goats is his slight playoff dip. I'd expect a guy with his regular season profile to either have LeBron or Jordan relative box score numbers, or goat level impact data, but he doesn't have either of those, in the playoffs. || Stats aren't everything. He has great stats-- legendary stats, the best stats--yes. And he can make a team better when he's the focal point.

But beyond that, he lacks a lot of the traits that ""the best player in the world"" should have:

* the ability to take over games and series, night in, night out
* the ability to carry a team much farther than they would go otherwise
* excellent defense
* dominating his fellow stars in at least one All-Star game
* helping his team win multiple rings (still to be decided)
* the dominant ""Shaq effect"" that makes he and his team feel unbeatable 
* the killer approach of MJ
* the all-around dominance of prime Bron

He looks like ""one of the best,"" but not ""the best."" Right now, SGA is who really impresses me. || If Embiid never got hurt last year then he would have ran away with the MVP again. Why isn’t that talked about? || I think he's currently the best player in the league, and has been for the last 3-4 seasons.

  
His passing (better than LeBron's), footwork (great fundamentals), and shooting (both midrange and 3p) are elite.

What's interesting is that he also played with some defensive bigs (Moses and Dawkins) who you would think would hold down the fort. But maybe because of their presence he was able to be even bolder in going for a block?

For Dr. J all of that league context stuff comes into play, plus there were less unbelievable athletes like himself running around so he could take more risks and punish drives around the rim more than he could in other eras, and at a higher rate. 

Not to take anything away from him though, I mean, he was great at timing shots at the rim, obviously one of the greatest leapers in NBA history, and had really good hands. He sort of played defense how a younger Jordan played, where he was hunting turnovers and leveraging his crazy athleticism to be a defensive playmaker.

While many fans claim LeBron was snubbed for MVP in 2011, I like to point out that Derrick Rose had 51 blocks to LeBron James’ 50 blocks despite being an entire 5” shorter, smaller hands, and shorter arms. 

LeBron only averaged more than 1 BPG 4 times (2008-2010 & 2022). I don’t have an explanation as to why Dr J is a better shot blocker. Maybe it’s his big hands, his skinnier frame, or the fact that LeBron spent a chunk of his career as a small ball power forward. || Because Lebron is a flashy blocker but not a particularly good blocker. He's excellent at one particular but not particularly commonly needed type of block which is the chasedown. He's not really good at blocking outside of that. For context, Larry Bird, who is certainly not known as a good blocker. Has a higher career average bpg than Lebron. || I imagine that during his heyday Dr J was like MJ being the most athletic guy around.

Dr J was extremely athletic and was going for blocks in a league that took tons of shots and wasn’t very good at making them. While the ABA had 3’s, the NBA didn’t for J’s first few seasons.

Above average defender but not as impressive as his stats say. ABA was smaller, so he recorded more blocks and rebounds there. Was a major part of Nets top ranked defense in 1976. Signal on the Sixers was  not as strong and his reputation didn't come close to Bobby Jones or Mo Cheeks. || Basketball was played foul line to rim back then. There were more blocks in general || Check their personal foul averages: Dr. J averaged 2.8 fouls per game for his career, with three seasons over 3 fouls per game. LeBron, on the other hand, has a career average of 1.8 fouls per game and has never averaged more than 2.3 in any season.

LeBron is known for defending without fouling, and his blocks typically come at critical moments rather than as a constant pursuit. He avoids chasing blocks early in games to stay out of foul trouble—you can't help your team from the bench. 

In the long run, taking unnecessary risks for a block hurts the team more than the benefit of one extra highlight play.

In other words, LeBron was smarter than Dr. J. || Jaren Jackson of the Memphis Grizzlies had his best seasons of blocks when Steven Adams was holding down the paint.  Blocks are sometimes about having the freedom to go after the ball and not worry about guarding the basket.  Julius Erving is another great example of this. || You've got Durant and Marion at #63 and #64 respectively. Terry Tyler (!) at #51, Kirilenko(!) at #43. And then Dr. J at #24. He's just so otherworldly different from every other player at his position. 

My question is this, who did Dr. J play with in the PF position? 

Looking at Terry Tyler, he had Bob Lanier in the C position, himself at PF, and Carr at SF, He had 2.5 blocks per game against Lanier's 1.4. So Terry Tyler blocked more than his Centre in the Pistons. 

In 1980, the Pistons had Lanier at C, and Bob McAdoo at PF, leaving Terry Tyler at SF. Tyler outblocked his Centre from the SF position. 

From what I can see Bob Lanier in the 80s, just didn't do blocks as a C, so Terry Tyler had to block the rim. 

It looks to me like Dr. J did the same. || I think back then off ball team defense wasn't valued as much as on ball defense, where as its the opposite today. || Yeah I don’t think was a great man to man defender but I feel like he was a great weak side helper, like Giannis || Letting your opponent blow past you 1v1 and then chase down blocking their lay up or swatting their shot into the crowd from behind seems like a total street ball flex move. He was a street ball legend before he ever went pro so I can totally see him developing ""lazy"" 1v1 defense since he was so much more athletic than most other street ball dudes. || I think watching Bill Russell with modern coaching may be a better time machine but Dr J is up there. He'd love the modern era as a fluid hyper athletic big wing. You could park him on a shooter in the weakside corner and l t the center play up trusting Doc to come in from the blind side for the block. It would be amazing. Also imagine him playing with Luka or someone who could put a lob in the right spot everytime? It would be what we didn't get from his dalliance with the Hawks and Pistol Pete. || True, but that doesn't account for the fact that the only small forward in the top 25, and one of two in the top 50 is Dr. J. And it's not like Lebron is number 2, but he is in the top 5 due to longevity. || He is also known for not defending at times on the court.     Kuzma even pushed him to get him to cover his man. || LeBron hasn't been a consistent or elite defender since his years in Miami, so the fact that he has less fouls is not that shocking. || Ok so here's the deal with Dr. J.

On that list it's counting ABA and NBA stats (though he'd still be #2 if it were just NBA stats). In the ABA the high end talent was as good as the NBA's high end talent, but the general instability of the league and the middle-to-low end talent was worse. The game was also quicker and more fluid. This allowed for a pretty significant stat boost for the best guys in the league for things like steals and blocks. 

When he was with the Virginia Squires for two years I know he had Jim Eakins for at least 73 and he was like an okay rim protector for a center but nothing remarkable. Then he goes to the Nets and he has Billy Paultz who was a 2bpg kind of guy while Erving was at 2.4. They also had Larry Kenon at the PF, but not exactly a guy who was at the rim, and also kind of a SF/PF hybrid. 

Dr. J played a lot of ""power forward"" in the ABA because he could jump out of the gym, was a big guy, and it was an era where packing the paint was pretty common. I mean he averaged 16 rebounds his rookie year and was between 10-12 for the next 4 years in the ABA after that. He was around the action all the time.

Then he goes to Philly and I'll spare you the history lesson on that mess, but Caldwell Jones was there who was a good shot blocker at C, a young Dawkins until he forced his way out at C who was a guy who liked to hunt blocks, but also McGinnis who was a steals guy not a blocks guy at PF. So he was doing his Julius stuff where he'd be playing man-to-man defense of the era and get guys at the rim and also do his help side block stuff just by virtue of being sunk into the paint off people.

By 79 Bobby Jones comes in to play PF and he's a MONSTER defensively but not a *crazy* blocks guy. Not bad or anything though. and Moses comes over in 83 and replaces Caldwell/Dawkins and is you know, a guy who gets blocks by virtue of being a center, but not some insane rim protector type either. In fact in 84 Erving was blocking more shots than a 28 year old Moses.

Ultimately he wasn't around any super high end blocks guy, but decent to quite good rim protectors at center and forward for most of the time in his career. He was just a crazy athlete who was a really active help defender and was in the paint a whole hell of a lot. You get an athlete with that kind of burst and his instinct is to make those type of flashy plays rather than stick to the ground, you play in eras where the paint is more compact and he's not floating off on the perimeter all the time, and there you have it. || Back in his day,  the SF often played closer to the PF than they did to the SG.  The concept of a 2/3 ""Wing"" didn't really come to fruition until the mid to late 80s.  

If you watch old DR J footage,  he's basically within 1-3 feet of his centre.  But he gets blocks in a variety of ways.  Chase downs, weak side blocks but just straight up contesting dudes at the rim as well. 

This is 1986 when old Dr J got 6 blocks in a playoff game.  Kind of highlights his skillset and the play style at the time.  >  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viQ-ldaJRfk&t=48s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viQ-ldaJRfk&t=48s) || It wasn't valued because off ball defense wasn't particularly valuable. Zone wasn't allowed and you were required to hard double and couldn't hedge so playing off ball defense was nearly impossible to do well since that meant you'd have to essentially leave your man completely open. || Eh this is only like half true, near the end of the split leagues the ABA was just straight up better than the NBA, interleague matchups were pretty much scheduled wins for the ABA, and these weren’t like all star games where it was the best ABA guys vs the best NBA guys, this was teams vs teams. So for them to have had such staggering victory numbers would mean 1 of 2 things would need to be true:

1) the high end talent in the ABA was heads and shoulders above the NBA, enough so as to offset the gap between the middle and low talent

Or

2) overall talent in the ABA was better, or averaged out to being better some way or another

It should also be noted that Dr. J handed the NBA 2 of their wins by playing for the Hawks against the ABA, in matches they almost certainly would’ve lost without him. 

Anyways, all of that out of the way, you’re correct that the counting stats in the ABA a was higher but I think the analysis that this was because of a talent gap (which either didn’t exist during Dr. J’s primary years or at the very least we don’t have any evidence that supports it did exist) is false. I do believe the second point you touched on about the fluidity and less rigid structure and coaching philosophy of the ABA is what allowed those numbers to be higher. But also Dr. J’s block numbers were pretty much the same in both years barring one outlier year in the ABA where he had 2.4. 

The ABA played much closer to how “modern” nba would’ve been (in so far as I can tell based on what I’ve read and watched myself) in that they emphasized the fastbreak, get out and run, quick possessions for more scoring opportunities and etc. very far ahead of its time. I think that’s why the counting stats were higher. 

A lot of your analysis involving the bigs he played with and his role in defense was spot on. However I think your conclusion was off. Dr. J by all accounts was a super high end blocks guy especially for his position, your reasoning for why he was (extremely rare athleticism, style of play, defensive style and etc.) explain why he was a high end shot blocker, not detract from the notion. 

Ultimately Dr. J had out of this world athleticism and really good instincts and timing which allowed him to do what he did as far as shot blocking goes. He also had incredible control over his body, and understood the game well enough. At the end of the day there were plenty of players in similar situations that did not do as he did, and even as all of his other skills declined he remained a good shot blocked up until the last day of his career, it’s the only stat he never truly regressed in save for one real down year and the era had shifted drastically by then, the paint was quite as packed and etc. So I think the only real conclusion you can come to here is that he really was just *that* good of a shot blocker, and the circumstances of the teams he played on allowed him to capitalize on that innate strength. || > Eh this is only like half true, near the end of the split leagues the ABA was just straight up better than the NBA,

It definitely wasn't. At all. The high end talent, maybe? Maybe one singular team in the 76 Nuggets was, but that's really it. Plus those scrimmages weren't taken that seriously either and it's a pretty low sample size. || Sample size wasn’t low at all and the scrimmages were taken very seriously because the leagues had bad blood. You’re woefully misinformed here. Coaches would regularly get ejected and be listening to the games from the locker room because they’d be so heated. And it wasn’t just the coaches either, stars of both leagues would get ejected for playing far too rough with each other than they would in regalar matches. They were taken extremely seriously lmao. 

Also, the sample size was 31 games per year (I’m using averages here, they played 155 games total over a 5 year span) which is like almost half of an nba season, not a small sample size at all. Initially the NBA won most of them, the last 3-4 years was the inverse. The end result was the ABA winning the rivalry by 3 games. There’s really no evidence to support the claim that there was this massive talent discrepancy towards the end there beside you making baseless assumptions. If we use the information available to us, that doesn’t seem to be the case at all. It’s fine to have your own headcanon but this is supposed to be a space where we use more than conjecture to these debates. If you have some evidence I haven’t seen here I’d be happy to see it but all the data we have suggests at best the leagues were evenly matched and at worst the ABA was better. || I was speaking on the ABA vs. NBA all-star games. Not the team vs. team exhibitions. 

Even those exhibitions were... uh... weird to say the least. Different rules for different halves of basketball, you couldn't foul out of the games, and a bunch of other stuff. I think you're just getting your ""super intense"" idea about these games based on a singular website.

So yes, maybe AD was the best they could've gotten as a headliner, but I think the package overall could've been better and thus appear less lopsided. I don't know what kind of hard ball Rob Pelinka played, but I know Nico Harrison shouldn't have gone along with it. || No they could not have , they wanted to slant defense + they got a Top 7-8 player. || Even if Doncic had to be traded, they should have taken the Lawers for everything, and Pelinka would have been happy to oblige.

AD + Reaves + 2FRPs isnt anywhere near as bad. 

AD is kinda redundant, they already have great rim protection and help defense, they need ball handling, playamking and over the top shotmaking, all of which Luka was responsible for. 

Their main issue is now Kyrie is the only player on the entire team that can reliably create his own shot in the playoffs. He is now also responsible  for creating everyone else's shots too. Their starting 5 will have 3 non shooters and 3 non creators. AD and Kyrie will be entirely responsible for the offense and I think that is too much of a role for them to handle.

AD is good, but overall they would have been better with like Ja + Bane or JJJ. I think Franz + picks would have been better. Cade + picks too. Basically any young star with superstar potential + picks to make other deals would have been superior to AD. || There are probably only 4 players in the NBA who their team would not trade straight up for Luka: Jokic, SGA, Giannis, Wemby.  Maybe throw Tatum on that list, although I think the Celts would do this because of the money difference since Tatum's supermax starts next year.  So anybody second team All-NBA and lower would be fair game, and most of them are younger than AD.  Jaylen Brown?  Done.  Anthony Edwards?  Done.  Devin Booker?  Done.  DMitch?  Done.  Want a younger player with star defensive ability on a cheaper contract?  Evan Mobley, Chet Holmgren, Bam Adebayo, Jaren Jackson Jr wouldn't be untouchable for Luka. || I really don't think so -- like, the five untouchables you named and Luka is the full list of players I'm confident are better than AD right now. Out of the guys who are around as good as AD, a good number are small guards you wouldn't want to pair with Kyrie, and then even if other players like KD, Ant, Mitchell, and Booker would probably fit fine next to Kyrie, I don't think it's crazy to prioritize a defensive number one and hope your role players can step up into slightly bigger offensive roles.

That said, they're probably supposed to trade one of Lively or Gafford now, and it probably would've been nice for them to get another asset to use there || They could have easily secured the Mavs current AND future rosters with the haul Luka would have provided.

Teams without a reliable shot-creator and playmaker don't have championship aspirations, and while Kyrie is very good in certain ways he's a 32 year old who has never proven he can be an effective first option on a contender so I don't understand why they think he'll suddenly become one.


AD is probably underrated in all of this but it really feels like you smashed a couple 1B players together and hoped for the best when you already had a top 3 franchise cornerstone in the league on the roster.


I guess what it comes down to is: you have a 25 year old first team All-NBA player. Why are you in ""win now"" mode when your goal should be to win a championship with him within the next 5-7 years?


One of the things I keep telling myself about Luka is that he is still young enough that we may not have seen the best version of him yet. Usually there's a year 26-28 year old leap for the real superstars so the next level for the franchise could have been that Luka started to address the few faults that he had and reached an even higher level. Lebron truly ascended at age 27, that second year on Miami. What if Luka was destined for a similar leap and the Mavericks sold low right before Luka really peaked? Why bet against him?

Secondly, Luka and  Lebron are smart enough as players to figure out how to make this work.  Lebron is a basketball savant by himself.

Let’s look at the facts.

Mavericks angle:

1- They had one all-time great level, one superstar level guard, neither of them could play even an okay point of attack defense.

2- They had zero threat of interior scoring except lobs.

3- All the defensive bigs they have were a liability on the other end so there couldn’t be more than one of them on the floor simultaneously.

4- They had an okay depth of ball-playing guards with Dinwiddie and Hardy. Exum made his season debut too.

With this trade, Mavs got a prolific interior scoring threat who will be able to pair astonishingly well with Gafford/Lively. We all know that he prefers to play the 4 and Gafford is the best fit in the league for Davis in this manner. He won’t have all the defence on his back so that’ll affect his performance on the other end in a very good way too. He can go back to Pelicans AD levels of production.

As an added bonus, in the lineup, now they have space for a guard who will attack the player with the ball in Max Christie.

In short, out of all the possible trade scenarios for Doncic, this was the best for the Mavericks. They got the best fit on both ends of the floor in the whole league. No other team could give them a package like that for win now purposes. The team improved significantly.

Lakers angle is pretty short:

1- Their existing problems became much bigger. Now three best players of this team are ball-dominant players and they don’t have any concept of defense at all. Without additional moves they’ve absolutely zero chance to make it to play-offs this season.

2- They set a high ceiling for post-LeBron era.


In short, Doncic is the best player in this trade but basketball is a team sport and Mavericks got improved a ton.

Lakers won’t suck in the near future. And that’s all for now without other moves.",0,93,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ifsnmo/doncicdavis_trade_is_a_winwin_trade_with/,2025-02-02 03:13:42,"The Mavs just traded a generational talent for a 31 year old who will make their roster worse as a “win now” move.

This was by no means win-win

Mavericks just went from “a team who could potentially win a championship in the near future” to “a team that won’t sniff a conference finals for the next decade unless some sort of miracle occurs”. || It's not a win-win trade. I think there's a chance that the Mavs are better in aggregate this year because the Mavs could have a defense as potent as the Wolves last season if AD gels with Lively. I don't think it's a high percentage chance but I think people are being too dismissive of the AD Mavs. At least this year and maybe next year. AD's age and injury history - though he has been more available lately - means the Mavs probably lose big in the long run 


Long-term the Lakers are clear winners, and it's not close, but I do think their roster is worse in the immediate. Luka and LBJ are duplicative and their remaining front court has no chance to make it through the West. But they have their cornerstone for the next decade so they will be the winners over time almost certainly  || I mean if we're looking at this in terms of a win-now move, there are still a lot of flaws present with getting such a high-risk return for Luka

1. Availability - AD's injury history is known, but this also applies to other pieces on the mavs like kyrie and lively. In addition, lively being out(likely for these upcoming playoffs as well) puts more USG% on davis on the defensive end.

2. AD UFA risk next season - he doesnt have any kind of player option so this ups the risk of this trade further. Worst case scenario you lose luka for 1 postseason of AD

  
All of this comes with the associated growing pains of basically running a brand new offense for all the reasons you listed and this is not as much of a win-win as you think. || So they went from a generational perimeter scoring talent to a team with average guards? How the fuck is that a win? And how does more interior scoring fit in with Gafford and Lively, when they don't have a generational creator anymore? Just cause AD is more comfortable on defense, makes it a better fit? In what world is a team that's based around defensive minded forwards, off-ball scorers and a strong interior presence a better fit for a post-up centre rather than a perimeter guard? || I know post game is not favored now, thats why alot of teams dont have post players. Im pretty comfident luka monopolizimg playoff games with touches, beats any benefit that comes from ads post play. He was dominated pretty soundly by jokic in the past. Im sure the young star centers would cook him on the perimeter. I think its clear by now that ad puts up great numbers but it doesnt lead to winning. Hes 31.

There are so many great mid level guys in the nba, as a layman ijust dont see the benefit in focusing on guys like gafford or christie. Theyre not game changers or freaks.

I admit foraure that lebron held ad back, so maybe he comes in and dominates but again hes 31. It was just a crazy trade. 

To not steal 5 draft picks and instead take ad is just crazy and most likely collusion || I am willing to circle back to this post after this season. But you need to understand the market and value of players. The return for Luka is malpractice and potential corruption. Davis is not in his 13th NBA season, this is Luka's 7th. Davis has almost double the mileage and being a big man, that will not age well. || “In short out of all the possible trade scenarios”

This is exactly the problem. What other trade scenarios. You make good arguments for why the deal makes sense for both teams. But most of the grades for this trade are based on the poor negotiating from Dallas, they didn’t engage in any other scenarios.

When AD only requested the Lakers, NOLA still made them squirm. Same with KD to Suns. Same with Harden to Nets. And so on. And it’s not even clear Luka made a specific request. 

Just complete malpractice to not dangle him on the market for a bidding war, could have so easily squeezed reeves and another pick out of LA. 

Mavs lose this trade because they left way too much on the table. || Glad you made these exact points. Whatever LeBron and Adam silver are doing to basketball is beyond me. Sure it’ll be fun to watch Luke and LeBron play on the offense but defense will be so much more atrocious now. The mavs on the other hand can focus on a more team oriented brand of basketball seeing as Kyrie and klay are already used to being a piece of something much bigger. And a lot of the talent they got is pretty good already to some extent. Sadly I don’t think either team will make it to the finals from this trade… || No one is going to hear you they are all convinced this is bad and the Mavs got fleeced. They don't look at the whole trade, ramifications of it and all the factors that made it happen. || Mate...you don't trade a superstar for a pack of chips. That's exactly what has happened here. This whole thing smells of collusion. || Luka is a generational talent yet the mavs have never had a high seed before. And they’ve been consistently knocked out in the 1st or 2nd round. Only until Kyrie found another gear did the mavs actually make it to the finals. All championship teams are built on 2-way players, lebron, Giannis, jokic, etc. Doncic is not one of them. || Wont sniff a conference finals is an overstatement. But they went from having one of the best future in the league and having a high chance of winning a chip to basically nothing. || They probably arent sniffing a playoffs again || you kind of just ignored all the points OP made above. the whole argument is that AD is a better fit than luka, which is pretty reasonable || And the Wolves ""potent"" defense got obliterated by Luka Doncic, the guy they traded. || >But they have their cornerstone for the next decade so they will be the winners over time almost certainly 


Do not underestimate the Lakers ability to totally fuck this up. They really need to make some magic happen for that roster to be championship caliber || AD just signed an extension and won’t be UFA till 28-29 season. || we can only go on recency though, AD missed 6 games last year and to date in the last 2 seasons AD has missed 11 games to Luka's 38, that has to count for something right?, this is the 3rd year that calf strain has reared its head ... Also AD had much more to do on the Lakers on D that he would have to even with Lively out. || 1- Gafford is one of the 5 best defensive bigs in the league. He’s a much better player than Lively, he’ll pair with the Davis great and Davis will have much less workload so it’ll improve his availability too.

2- That’s a big risk, you’re right on that. || Not trying to troll, but has there ever been a truly ""generational"" player that has not won an MVP? does that matter ? not saying he can't in the future but everything is still ""potential"" until he wins something , which is why the game is played. AD won a championship (and was the best player despite Lebron getting the favoritism award) and he was the only player in the NBA last year that was first team all defense AND offense. Both AD and Kyrie sacrificed their game for Bron and Luka, I think this is being vastly underestimated and an overreaction based on fans emotional connection to Luka. 

  
Sure he made the finals, but it wasn't close, he was hunted and that strategy got them 4-1nd ... is there any evidence that he could actually win it with the team constructed?  They got exposed badly.  I am just asking these questions based on what has actually happened not to troll in any way... || You think Lebron really gave the okay to trade Anthony Davis? lol || Mavs absolutely got fleeced. AD can’t stay on the court and they got almost nothing in future assets. If the Mavs don’t win this year or next year the whole thing is a bust. The Mavs have very little shot creation now so they better hope the defense can hold teams under 85 because otherwise they won’t be able to score enough to keep up. || Mavs getting only 2 future assets (Christie, and the 2029 1st rounder) for Doncic is not enough.   That's the main problem with this trade.  

With Davis/Kyrie/Klay/Dinwiddie, they have a championship window of 3 years at best (age/injury history).    What's left after that?  Which players are left that they can develop into a star, or trade for a star?  Will they be going thru a mini-rebuild? Who will replace Kyrie/Dinwiddie as the playmakers?      

Nico only focused on just a 3 year span, and said F the future.   He even said ""**The future to me is 3-4 years from now.** **The future 10 years from now -- they'll probably bury me by then"".    A general manager saying that is just wild.**

Draft Picks are not a guarantee, but it's a good thing to have a stockpile of them, and with Doncic, you could have secured way more than a 2029 first round pick, this way getting better in the present and preparing for the future. || a pack of chips that was the ONLY player in the entire NBA last year that was first team all defense AND offense ... the AD disrespect is CRAZY ... || The idea that the Mavs never had a high seed or that they only became contenders because of Kyrie is just incorrect. Sure, Luka made the playoffs in his 2nd and 3rd seasons, losing in the first round as a lower seed. But in his 4th season—before Kyrie was on the team—he led the Mavs to the Western Conference Finals as the 4th seed, meaning they were actually the higher seed in the first round. 

Also, the idea that all championship teams are built purely on two-way players isn’t true. The 2015 Warriors won a title with Steph Curry and Klay Thompson as their stars, and neither was considered an elite two-way player at the time. || I agree with you but Jokic isnt no way a 2 way player  || It’s not an overstatement when you consider how stacked the western conference is and how the Mavs two best players are injury riddled. || they would have to play 1000% better than they did in their first chip appearance though lol || A better fit? The entire Mavs offense revolves around Luka and they made it to the finals last year with that exact formula. AD is by no means a “better fit”. || Everyone is ignoring the Chemistry issue.   

It might not be a perfect fit this season, when you consider that the current team was built around Doncic, with their post play being mostly lobs.    They are mostly a 3 and Lob team.  

They now have to create and run more elbow/post plays than they are used to.   AD has to gel with Gafford/Lively immediately.   Kyrie has to transition to a full time set-up guard, because someone has to get the ball to AD.",0.0,0.874,0.126,0.3182,0.046,0.811,0.143,0.9761,0.086,0.74,0.174,0.9997

Hopefully they get a good bigman || These takes are crazy. Kyrie or AD cannot be the best player on a championship team. It's not going to happen, unless maybe they get a true third star. 

If the Lakers get a big before the deadline, I think the team is better. Luka is a top 3 player.  He carried a pretty weak team to the western finals a few years ago. This laker team is better than that Dallas team because LeBron is still a beast when needed. || 2-3 year period the Mavs win if healthy. Long term after LeBron retires the Lakers win cause they have a star to build around. Mavs must have known something though cause they didn't want to give Luka a supermax contract. Crazy fucking trade all around. || I’m commenting everywhere but this trade actually has the lakers lined up to make another move.

Rui and Reaves are their best assets and if you throw Knecht and picks, that might be enough for a near max player.

Rui and Reaves are terrible fits next to Luka and LeBron because of their defense and Reaves will have a tough time on offense. He struggle a bit playing next to dlo, playing next to Luka will be 10x worse. || Lakers have a 40 year old that doesn't play much defense a 25 year old doesn't play defense, an Austin Reeves that gets targeted lol.

I don't like Mavs future but I like their next 2 years || Mavs Defense is good now, but their offense just got absolutely decimated.

In that regards,
Probably 
Luka
Vincent 
DFS
Lebron 
Centre (turner or kessler) || I wonder if the Lakers will try to move Reaves for big man. A Luke/Reeves backcourt is pretty brutal on defense. Wonder if they'd call the Raptors about Poeltl? Or maybe Reaves to the Magic for Wendal Carter Jr? There's not exactly a ton of starting quality centers out there for trade.  || The new Mavs look like the Clippers IMO. A solid on-ball one-way star guard, an elite two-way player, and solid roleplayers around them. That's a good team, high regular season floor, but almost 0 chance to win a ring. To add to the comprisons, all 3 stars are over their peak and will only get worse in time.

The Lakers at the moment are a mess. I don't see a path for them to be an average defensive team, and Luka, Bron and Reaves seem a bit redundant on offense. Sure, Luka alone proved to carry a team to a top 5 offense, so this group can be top 3 (or even the ebst half-cout offense), but that is not enough to be a contender. Interestingly, there was a world where the old Lakers could compete for a title if the stars aligned, and I think the chance is lost (for this year), unless they make a follow-up move or two. || If I would set it up, I might move dinwiddie to one, Irving to two, Thompson three. 
Kyrie is awesome but I somehow can’t see him as a facilitator, he’s very good with an aggressive playmaker. He was great with LeBron, Harden and Luka. 

The issue with this lineup is it lacks Luka. Without him you have some isoball with Klay pouting in the corner waiting for a pass that never comes. 

AD doesn’t create, he isos or finishes. 
Kyrie is a willing passer, but when he’s in scoring mode he will just attack. So they kinda switch isos I guess? I dunno, they got rid of a generational playmaker while having a team that relies on a playmaker and a system of plays and movement built around that. 

It’s not a bad team but I just don’t see the fit. Not even talking about chemistry issues after they signed players who wanted to play with Doncic. || I would move PJ to the bench and start Grimes. I can’t see PJ guarding wings but Grimes can and he can shoot. || In short term both teams are worse even if fully healthy. Lakers now the worst defensive team in the league probably. || Lakers should start luka, reeves, bron, dfs and hayes. Hachimura off the bunch for scoring punch.  Dfs is needed to shore up defense.  Hopefully Lakers get a guy like Poetl or Claxton to start the 5 and then they are cooking with gas. || As a Pelicans fan I am actually very curious to see if Luka can actually make Jaxson Hayes  good on offense. He cant help Hayes on defense or rebounding but Hayes can rim run and set screens. || The cap space and trade requirements are beyond my comprehension. Can Los Angeles move LeBron to Miami for Butler? Butler and Luka can compliment each other (or destroy each other I'm not sure).  What are your thoughts? Is there another move incoming || Kyrie can’t. He’s had 14 years and multiple teams and chances to prove it. He’s 32 and starting to slow down.

Moving the super star from the back court to the front court is only going to make things harder for Irving too, since teams can now put their best guard defender on Kyrie instead of Luka.

Take Boston for example. Brown and Jrue were the primary defenders on Luka, and when Jrue was on him that meant Brown was out, so Kyrie was facing off against guys like Derrick White.

Now Kyrie is going to get the Jrue and Brown treatment. Jrue will likely be the primary because they’d rather Jrue be on Kyrie than Klay, but if Klay is ever out of the game when Kyrie is in or Kyrie starts going off, Boston will plant Brown on his ass.

It’s the same with any team though. Kyrie is going to have more difficulty scoring, so AD will have to play even better than Luka did last year to carry the team. I just don’t see that happening. || AD already has || I mean realistically he just takes a paycut so Lakers can get another max player for best shot at winning. || Lebron is 40 bro, teams target Austin and Luka plays no defense. Who's back there cleaning up the paint lol Jaxon Hayes hahhaha. || Yeah. I think before deadline closes they’ll end up with a big man, maybe through LeBron taking less.

He doesn’t play defense because he can’t not because he’s choosing not to lmao || [removed] || > 2-3 year period the Mavs win if healthy. 

This is one of my problems, define win in this context. Are the Mavs really a BETTER team now?

They made a move to win now, but I don’t see how this team can possibly be considered to be better than the one with Luka on it.

Let’s use the Celtics again as an example.

Last year the Celtics won handily because they could focus Luka and the rest of the team couldn’t elevate to counter.

AD is not better than Luka. If they met in the Finals again this year, Celtics focus on AD with our 500 centers and now also have Brown free to cover another dude. 

So Jrue locks up Kyrie again, Brown locks up Klay, Tatum is able to support any one of them, and Horford/Unicorn/Kornett with Queta and Tillman as bodies wrangle AD.

No way AD goes off for MORE than Luka does, and the rest of the team becomes easier to defend.

I mean, Mavs have max 2 chances to win with AD. This year as a 7-8 seed, and next year. Does anyone see that happening? || Shams claimed that the Mavs made the movie because they were worried about Luka’s conditioning. || Huh? If AD stays healthy, if they keep Kyrie etc. etc. and that’s assuming they’re a better team now, which may very well not be true. || Mavs just became easier to defend.

Sure the Mavs are big, but Klay Thompson is not the shooter and defender he once was and Kyrie has shown over and over again he can’t be the number 1 on a championship team.

AD is also easier (relatively speaking) to stop than Luka.

So they have the exact same problem they had last year, but now with a slightly worse player. || And what about the offensive production you get from Luka? Kyrie and AD aren’t making up for that. The Thunder lock Kyrie up and then who’s beating you on that team? Absolutely no one.

With all his flaws we’ve seen time and time again you need guys like Luka that can just take over games in the playoffs. Last time Kyrie was the #1 he got ran out of Boston and AD didn’t see any major playoff success until LeBron. || Kyrie can score so can PJ & Gafford & Ant what are you talking about lol || Lakers can’t offer enough to get Turner, assuming you’re talking about Myles.

1.) Obviously Luka didn't choose to go to LA. Plus the state taxes will be way different than it is in Texas once he sees the difference in his pay.

2.) Lebron James realistically has about another 1 or 2 years to play good basketball. That's if Father Time decides that even if LeBron wanted to play at a high level at some point his body's going to give out whether he wants it to happen or not.

3.) The Lakers don't really have a sense of direction right now and will realistically have to depend on free agency. Even if they were to make the playoffs this year, they won't go far. Luka just went from a contender team to a team trying to find an identity after trading their second Superstar.

4.) Luka will finally have a decision as to where he will want to play even though we know Dallas would have been his first choice.

Most of the laker players are 24-28 Dalton, Reaves, Vando, Rui, Gabe (all movable, cheap, short contracts) while only missing 2 FRP in the next 7 yrs. And if you think they won't go far in the PO with Bron AND Luka, then you haven't been watching the Lakers  

Why will he sign back with Dallas? The franchise that doesnt really want him? They need to change owner for him to rejoin that circus || Bron joins Lebois Ad and Kyrie this summer and Luka joins Wemby and Fox the next summer. All happy. || I agree with pretty much everything you’ve said here, but cmon. It’s the Lakers. They do right by their stars and are one of the only teams that could realistically build through free agency.

That said, if the Heat have max cap space, I think there’s a possibility he could sign there. They definitely have a more promising roster and the word in Mavs circles was always that Luka was interested in living in Miami. || I feel like you don’t really watch the lakers lol they basically tied with the nuggets in seeding with the same losses. They are 8-2 in their last 10 games. Just won against a hot knicks team and wrecked the clips without AD.

No matter where Luka goes, tax included, won’t more more than the 120mill Dallas screwed out of him || I genuinely don't understand why people find it so unthinkable that Luka would want to test out FA. The fact that this deal was done so abruptly and suddenly meant that Luka and his manager had zero leverage or ability to even say ""hey, if the mavericks want me gone, here's where i'd like to be."" They (as in both sides- lakers AND mavs) explicitly did it this way *so* Luka would have zero agency/leverage to ask for anything or see where else he could be a good fit.

I don't know why he would completely forego the option to test out FA given that he was deprived of any say in this trade. Someone like Fox atleast got to make the trade request, say where he wanted to go and Kings/Spurs made it happen. But Luka's trade happened like this specifically to deprive him of any ability to have a say in things. It is not unthinkable for me that he'd want to have a say and feel like FA is the way to go about it. || 1. Luka is making obscene amounts of money and I expect the endorsements being the superstar of the Lakers will more than cover the tax differences.

2. Not sure what LeBron has to do with Luka playing in LA.

3. The Lakers are one of the most sought after FA destinations, they can and will surround Luka with enough talent to compete.

4. I can't remember the last time a young athlete took a short term deal instead of locking in for as many years as they could, especially if they are going to be at the max anyways. Turning down guaranteed money is a risk. || yeah no, man, you're coping way too hard. there's no real reason to believe that luka won't extend in LA. yeah we're finding our identity, but its not like we're a terrible team right now. the mavs weren't doing too hot even when luka was healthy. 

i believe luka can see the long term vision, and he knows that he can sign long term contracts with the lakers to eventually have as much money as he wants. 

the lakers are counting on lebron retiring eventually, and being being players in the FA market. i don't see whats wrong with that. players and roleplayers will want to come to LA with the amount of cap space we're scheduled to have in a couple years, and for the opportunity to play with luka in his prime.

the mavs were *not* legit contenders lol. there's no universe in which the mavs are doing anything against a healthy okc team. even if by some fluke they made it to the finals again, not only are the celtics still as good as last year, the cavs are maybe even better than that. 

i'm sure dallas would have been his first choice up till a week ago, but now that he's in LA, and he builds a culture and legacy here, there's really no reason for him to want to go back to dallas. for one thing, the FO is entirely incompetent and they've snubbed him horribly. but even if that wasn't the case, kyrie klay and AD are all aging. dallas is going to be collapsing in a couple years while the lakers are going to be building a contender around luka. once luka signs the extension to get to the 10 years, he'll sign the vet max in la which'll recoup the potential money he's losing this offseason.

everything so far gives me an indication that luka is genuinely looking to leave his mark here and build a legacy. he's aiming to be a top 15+ player of all time, and the best way to do that is to stick it out in one place for as long as possible.

also, even if luka doesn't extend, hypothetically (which i *highly* doubt, but still), the lakers will easily just do the bidding war in the trade market that the mavs should've done. they'll get a big haul of picks and young stars in exchange for a year or so of luka, and offloading an aging AD. that's more than fair (although it's probaly not going to happen) || This applies to most teams that would’ve potentially traded for him. He can opt out following next season, and who knows how many of the remaining ~30 games this year he’s even healthy for. 

Like I personally would’ve traded Banchero plus however many picks to beat the Lakers’ offer, but Orlando between free agency/salary cap concerns plus overrating Banchero for being ‘their guy’ wouldn’t, and then even from Dallas’s perspective that’s a half-assed move because Paolo is way worse than AD now and wouldn’t have that much help in the future because the Mavs aside from Lively (who’s injured rn) are old and have traded future picks to build their current roster - that’s not competing with teams like Houston, Memphis, and San Antonio that are obviously set up super well for the future.

All these other management types are barking about how unfair it is they didn’t get to bid when they wouldn’t have actually given up that much for potentially a one-season rental. I would also say that if Dallas’ ownership did not want to pay him a supermax he assuredly would have taken that as an insult and wanted out. You can it was dumb/they cheaped out to not want to supermax him, but once that decision is made by ownership your hands are pretty much tied as a GM. || [removed] || Fox contract expires in the same offseason as Luka’s. That said, assuming Luka actually want to go to Spurs, they will just do sign-and-trade with Lakers for Fox: that way LAL still get a quality and still young guard for their retool instead of losing Luka for nothing.

Miami will also have cap space in 2026 and can have Luka join Herro and Bam who are roughly his age and they are missing that alpha level playmaker.

Nuggets will do literally anything legal (and probably a few illegal things too) to free up cap space should Luka be available: that’s only fair for them to give their biggest player in history in Jokic a chance to play with his best basketball friend.

I’m sure half of the league will be looking into making cap space available should there be indications that Luka is to go into FA: he is literally the biggest potential FA since LBJ if we take into account his off the court pull. But right now ball is in Lakers court, if they make correct moves over the next 6-9 months, he probably will stay. || Maaaan, imagine having Luka + Wenby in the same team. That will the futur dynastie of the league after the warriors, and probably will be the#1 cause of heart attack in Dallas. || how do the heat have a more promising roster? bam is supposed to be in his prime but he looks washed, tyler herro is doing great but if they want to take on luka's contract, he'll be making way too much money. in fact, i feel like the entire franchise is collapsing tbh. terry rozier is awful too. i guess jaime and jovic are somewhat intriguing, but i dont think they're necessarily championship calibre roleplayers to the point that luka would want to hop teams. || but *why*? i can't think of too many reasons. i think hteres a 0% chance he ever goes back to dallas, but what reason would he have to leave LA at this point? he has an opportunity to play a couple years with lebron while the lakers put a championship roster around him, he gets to play for a franchise which will attract loads of talent in FA, and again, it *is* the lakers. Luka said he likes the ocean in the press conference lmfao. I think at this moment, he's completely dialed in on winning a championship, and i genuinely think that being in LA puts him in the best position to do that. || 4. Doncic is in a unique situation here:

A) Other players always extend on the max they are eligible for, so they do max duration too.

B) Luka would have done the same, but now he is screwed out of supermax extension with that trade, meaning he will only make a normal max: that’s 100M left on the table over 5 years.

C) With that in mind, it makes sense to sign a 2 year extension in 2026 first, get to 10 years of service and again qualify for a veteran supermax and then finally lock-in for 5 years. This way he maximises the money he makes by being on a standard max for 2 years only instead of 5 and then getting absolutely most money possible; not to mention it is easier for teams to justify giving him veteran supermax at 29 than it would be at 32. || Dwight Howard left, just to answer your question, with Steve Nash(aged), Kobe and Pau Gasol on the team.

Kobe was THIS close to leaving, but shrewd trades saved his legacy in LA: should Rob pull out another rabbit out of his hat, Luka will similarly stay, but if Lakers stay put and don’t try to be aggressive, Doncic may be out in a 1.5 year. || Luka and Jokic would be a team that wins almost every game with a score of 140-135 || Ware, Jaime, Jovic, Herro, and Bam are all interesting players. You’re probably right that they would have to move Herro or Bam if they realistically wanted to sign Luka, but even then they probably have four players that could be seen as long term building blocks. 

Outside of Reaves and maybe Knecht, i don’t think the Lakers have any long term pieces. They also have leveraged all of their trade-able picks until 2031 || It’s essentially replacing Murray with Luka: it’s not like Jamal is some excellent defender as is. 

They would have an even more potent offense while defense would stay relatively the same or maybe even improve a bit: Luka’s advanced defensive stats are better than Murray’s. || you don't think DFS, Vando, or Rui are good long term pieces around Luka? shit, i guess we'll have to agree to disagree, because i think with a 3&D guard and a good center rotation, the lakers are much closer to being contenders than people realize.

and i imagine that the lakers will build through FA since we have a lot of expiring contracts around 2026 and 2027. || Oh I wasn’t poo pooing it, it would be a super fun team to watch and if the Nuggets got the opportunity they should take it.

They’d also just need to make sure they pick up another couple bodies who play good D to help out. || DFS is awesome but definitely too old to be considered a long term piece imo.

Vando is the type of player I could see Luka elevating, but he’s not a good offensive player and misses a ton of games. 

Rui is a solid piece, I forgot about him tbh. Again, this is probably a player Luka could elevate. He’s probably the closest to a long term piece after Reaves.

Luka Doncic has never played under 60 games, has been 1st team all-NBA EVERY season aside from his rookie season, and makes deep playoff runs. And for those who play the Celtics card, they had a stacked ass roster and you can’t pretend the Mavs had an easy road to the finals. That takes a heavy toll no matter what. 
He had 29-9-5 with 2.6 steals in said finals too, with NONE of his teammates averaging over 20.

Worse, only 2 of them even managed over 10:
____

Kyrie: 20(19.8)-3-5
PJ Washington: 11-6-1
____
How was he supposed to win that against 5 dudes with 12+? He was leading both teams in points, rebounds, and steals, and was second in assists. 

Let’s not pretend like conditioning is such an issue when this is his production. 

And for defense: he was being pushed as a pressure point because he was partially injured while carrying a massive (basically the entire) offensive load for that series **while having the most steals.** Unless you’re LeBron or Kawhi, that’s not fucking humanly possible to deal with. All of this being said, he still ended up with a +/- score of +7 on the series. 

Considering their roster got even deeper this year, with great defenders like PJ, DLive and Gafford all improving, while adding more pieces, they were a definite contender as soon as everyone got healthy. Their 3-1 season record against OKC and their 19-10 record at Christmas is solid evidence that a winning series against any team is plausible. 

Furthermore, this team is NOT more well-rounded with AD. The Mavs already have a solid defensive core with PJ and Grimes on the perimeter, and DLive and Gafford in the paint. All of them play better off the ball, and although Kyrie is a decent passer, his strengths are more in his prolific scoring than shot creation. Neither he nor Dinwiddie can orchestrate an offense the way Luka can, and we’ve seen that in detail for the past month. Adding another big who needs a Bron/Luka archetype and trading it away in the same breath… what? 

Both teams lost this trade in the short term.

Lakers: basically out of contention — assuming  the same starting lineup, you’ve got 3 offensive oriented players in Luka, Reaves, and a 40-year old Bron. In isolation, this would be permissible, but you have all of them at the same time, while simultaneously losing your best defender AND your only good big man, and have two guys who need the ball in their hands to function. How LeBron/Luka will function as a second option or an alternating first option will have to be left to observation. 

Mavs: defense is improved. Taking the scoring aspect alone, you can still retain about 80-85% of what Luka gave you with AD, but now you’re reducing the effectiveness of everyone else who played their best game alongside a top 3 passer in the league. Offensively, I think their options are going to be heavily reduced and stagnated — your reliable options now are:
- Kyrie iso play
- Pick and rolls
- Throw AD the ball in the post
Passing plays that can actually throw off a defensive minded team now are going to be few and far between. 

Closing thoughts. I think without this trade, both teams would have had a better chance at the title this year from a single-season perspective. However, as the Lakers, they now have a franchise player for the next 10 years, and you’d be stupid not to make that trade. As for the Mavericks, this team is not winning now, and lost all of its future. I’m Mavs fan because of Luka in his rookie year, but I actually like everybody still on this roster including AD, so I’m sticking with ‘em. I’m still fucking grieving though.

To push back on this oft-repeated line with one sentence: elite chubby play is a young man's game.

To say more: you can get away with being a bit out of shape when you're in your 20s if you're talented enough. You can't get away with it for very long in your 30s, and historically this has been true. ""They now have their franchise player for the next 10 years"" is absolutely not a given in this case.

I'm not therefore making the argument that this was a good trade, I'm just pointing out what I see as a flawed point. || Idk man, look at Zion. Obviously Lakers won this trade. Even if they had a title contending team(they didn’t) they make it every time for how low the price was. 
As for Luka, we’re discussing the flaws to make it make sense. It’s literally the only reason why you would trade him away. And like, maybe in 3 years if he never turns the corner and works on taking better care of himself he starts to decline rapidly. It happens. Is that risk worth selling this low? I don’t think so. But someone in the FO did and must have had a good enough reason for it. || You are underselling his defense. He was historically bad at defense in the playoffs last season and he was a poor defender in the playoffs the seasons before that. 

There are very few teams that win championships with their best player being a negative on defense. Being a two way star isn’t exclusive to peak LeBron and Kyrie. It’s the norm for players considered in the top 10-15 or that trajectory.

He is an incredible offensive player which makes up for it, but I struggle to see him winning a chip if he’s that negative on defense.

Jokic is far worse actually when you realize he’s 7’ tall and can’t even be bothered to just stand at the rim and put his hands up. How does Luka get all of this shit for not being able to guard the fastest people in the world on the perimeter, but Jokic gets a pass for gift wrapping the other team layup after layup? It’s so much easier for Jokic to put forth a pinch of effort at his defensive role, than it would be for Luka, but only one of these guys gets flack for it.

I averaged it out to be 1.5 stars per team and multiplied the result by 30 and got the number 45. Since 15 roster spots is the max for NBA rosters, the estimated total number of NBA players in the league is 450. 45/450 divides perfectly into the top 10% of the league. 150 starters and 300 reserves. There are only 24 spots for the NBA all-star game each season. 24/ 45 estimated ""Stars"" comes to little over 53% of NBA stars in the league actually make the team. I can easily why someone like Trae Young and Damian Lillard didn't make the team despite being some of the best players in the league at their position. I'm sure there were other good players in NBA history who didn't make an All-star team or made it once simply because there are only so many spots to get.

The available centers are not going to be a HUGE upgrade from Jaxson Hayes.

And Kessler and Turner is NOT going to materialize, no matter how many times the fans put a Lakers jersey over them in the thumbnails.

GMs spite the Lakers even more now, making it tougher for Rob to get a good center deal.

TBH, a lineup of Vando, DFS, Bron, Luka, and AR ain't really small ball. Being a few inches shorter at the 5 is not that big of a deal like most causals think it is.

I'm thinking just put Bron and 270lbs Luka on the Center and ~~Power Forward~~ stretch 4.

But....

**What about the Cavs and Nuggets? Won't they get destroyed by them?**

I'll answer this with a question...

How many points will this X center (who is not Kessler and Myles) going to prevent the Cavs and Nuggets frontline from making?

How many rebounds will he prevent them from taking?

**The Cavs and Nuggets frontline are going to score in the paint and get boards EVEN IF AD was still on the team!**

On defense, the key here is for the Lakers to stay on their man.

This way...

They prevent momentum/rhythm boosting 3-pointers (and backdoor assists) to the opposing team role players.

Remember the Boston game where the Lakers switched everything and trusted their guards to battle Porzingis down low? That strategy wasn't so bad. Matter of fact, it disrupted the Celtic's offense as they couldn't take as much 3s as they wanted to.

[Remember, Porzingis scored 22 pts that game but the Lakers still won by 20 pts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1i8oapo/post_game_thread_the_los_angeles_lakers_2418/)

That said...

So just let Joker and Mobely get theirs down low like what Porzingis did.

Vando and DFS are also good positional rebounders, neutralizing the 3 inches that they give up on conventional centers.

Again... that's just 3 fucking inches!

If Rodman can guard Shaq for a few possessions, I think Vando will be able to hold his own on the average NBA bigs...

Except Joker of course.

It’s gonna be a lot of high risk high reward to start this new Luka experience but they’ll inevitably figure it out.

I kinda think the real key to it all is having Lebron move into the Draymond green role. Let him set screens and set up hockey assists and dunks on baseline. Additionally I think JJ will really need to start labbing extra in practice with AR + Kenecht (assuming they stay) about moving around without ball for more catch and shoots.

If they’re smart, they let Luka really dictate the flow and have JJ set up off ball motions for the shooters and slashers to just run a mock warriors offense. || [removed] || [Hayes played only 23 mins against the best defensive-rebounding team in the NBA. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1ii2w6b/post_game_thread_the_los_angeles_lakers_defeat/)  
  
But the Clippers still got outrebounded by the Lakers. || This is the starting line-up I've worked with in a 2K save since the trade. The team started a full season 15-1, and were averaging like 130ppg in simulated games. || op u remember that game in 2023 when we got destroyed by the rockets because we had no big? im afraid it would look like that || To be that small, you gotta score that quick. LeBron in a pull up midrange is a no and so is him constantly running around screens || I'm not super sure why you think adding a big isn't going to happen. I don't think they'll pick up an all-star, but snatching a starter seems very doable. Just think about how many centers there are who would be an upgrade over anybody on the Lakers' roster. 

Let's say the Lakers offer some combo of picks, swaps, and players for Clint Capela. Atlanta would be crazy not to listen, especially if the Lakers are willing to overpay.

And there are maybe a dozen or two players the Lakers could go after that would be an upgrade over what they have.

I'm not saying they will make a trade because, as you've mentioned, Pelinka seems content to wait until the off-season rather than overpay. However, they absolutely could if they wanted to. || I can see the vision as all 5 are decent-good rebounders for their position. But, I don't think it will be a good starting but a lot better if it is a lineup that JJ pulls out to change the pace of the game or whenever opponent's starting C sits down. Still, if we want to seriously contend this year we need a starting caliber center as most western playoff teams have players that will absolutely abuse us without one. || With a whole offseason, they will probably have a better chance next year. I am sure there will be a couple of good vets that will wqnt to play with Bron and Luka. || Have to be careful with Vando because he has chronic foot problems so they’re probably not going to start him this season unless needed in the playoffs, to manage his minutes.  Besides, they’ve looked great starting Hayes, who’s 7 feet tall and athletic, and has been very good defensively in recent games. || I can see this panning out but it wouldn’t be this season, they’d need at least one summer practicing the play style needed. The rockets had to learn what they wanted to switch, how to play against what action, also James harden had to commit to playing a little more defense. The biggest issue with that theory is they’ll also have the summer to pick up more talent, and possibly axing this. || This was a good post. I think it's about having different lineups and styles of fight though. A forward centric lineup is a great change up but needs a contrasting lineup to make it more effective. || Mobley is shooting 40% from deep on 3 attempts per game. He isn't taking a ton but he will take them and make them if the defense dares him to. 


He was hitting the same mark for the second half of last season, too. Seems like a sustainable improvement (his FT% has also improved every season and his form looks great) || Vando's main benefit is his POA defense and his roaming defense (disruption). Forcing him to sit in the paint will make him into just a mediocre center. || That lineup has 3 below average defender (Reaves, Luka, 40yo LBJ) and, forget about rim protections, no one can guard ANY big. Rockets had 245lb bruiser PJ Tucker, DFS is 220, Vanderbilt less than that, and both are good poa/wing defender, so you're also losing what they do best, if you have them guard center. You also can't expect Luka or Lebron to bang with the bigs for 35 minutes and have them at their best on offense. Small lineups are also predicated on fast tempo (not really the methodical, deliberate style that Doncic and James prefers) and shooting, and Vanderbilt as a non-shooter will be a safe hiding spot for every bad defender on the opposing team.

In short, i think it's a bad idea. If it's not before the deadline, then re-tool this team around Luka/Lebron in the summer and get a good big; for now, play Hayes and Hachimura. || A Bronny and Luka backcourt would be the worst defensive backcourt in the league and it ain’t even close. They would get exposed bad. || How bout we use this as a ""Death Lineup"" in the last 5-6 minutes? || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || Based on the win earlier, this has potential to work. || Lakers play Hayes 23 minutes a game.

If Pelinka did not have a sense of urgency then, despite AD and Bron begging him, he wouldn't do it now. 

Rob thinking long term and gonna hold on to that 2031 FRP till this summer. || 
I'm thinking just put Bron and 270lbs Luka on the Center and stretch 4 || Luka is a 270 pound monster, he can easily guard bigs come on || Why would you start Bronny? OP is talking about LBJ, not Bronny lol || Vando is too offensively limited. The other teams big just won't guard him, so the Goberts of the world can just setup camp at the rim.

The original GSW death lineup worked because all 5 guys were a threat with the ball in their hands. Even when draymond stopped being able to shoot, he was still an elite playmaker out of the short roll (and a great illegal screener for Curry). || Bro we going to dead by the last 6 minutes with no true bigs. What we going to do shoot the lights out? || I couldn't disagree more. If anything, he's been too aggressive and way too deferential to Klutch over the last five years. They've traded everything that wasn't strapped down away to chase another ring they were never going to win. The reason they have picks now is because the Stepien Rule prevented them from trading them away years ago. 

It's only been over the last year or so that Pelinka started pushing back, culminating with the Luka trade, when he shipped out a Klutch client without running it by LeBron first. (Then again, maybe they knew. AD seems way less upset than Luka, and LeBron has had absolutely nothing to say about it even though he's the master of subtweets and passive aggression.)

Anyways. Pelinka orchestrated an in-season trade a couple of years ago that resulted in a WCF run. He traded for Luka this year. The guy is more than capable of being aggressive when the deal is right. I'm not saying he's for sure going to add before the deadline, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if he did. || I never mentioned starting. If they played together it would be a trash defensive backcourt  || JJ likes to play horns a lot.   
  
It's where two players position themselves at the elbows while the ball handler initiates plays like pick-and-rolls, handoffs, or passes to create scoring opportunities. So we don't need a Draymond type big to playmaker with this type of action.

In major points:

\- 30/13/10 on 66% TS is insane. Russ did this in 2016 on 55% TS and everyone went crazy - that's the difference between a league average efficiency scorer and perhaps the most efficient volume scorer in NBA history. His efficiency gets even crazier when you look at the fact that he puts a ton of his own misses back with his offensive rebounds, leading the league in self putbacks by far. He is near 70% when you account for the fact that in such scenarios, the first shot doesn't cost a possession and efficiency is best measured per possession. He is also shooting 47% from three, and if you take out the heaves it's still over 50%. FIFTY PERCENT FROM THREE. He is averaging more points per jumpshot this year than Steph Curry did in any of his best seasons. That's insane

\- We can look at offensive on/off to measure how a team's offense performs with vs without a player. While not a perfect stat, it gives a good gauge of offensive impact. Jokic already has the two highest offensive on/off seasons since play by play data was first recorded in 1997, both around +19 points/100 possessions. For comparison to some of the best offensive players' best seasons since then, peak Steph had one +18 season, LeBron had a +15, Harden a +14, Kobe a +12, Embiid a +10, and Luka a +8 (keep in mind he plays \[played?\] with another high level offensive guard so this probably undersells his value). This season, Jokic has a +24 offensive on/off, by far the best of all time. Before you all come with the lineup manipulation critiques, the Nuggets have played **more minutes than ever** with Jokic + bench lineups. Jamal Murray has missed a ton of games and sucked in many others, Gordon has been out a lot, and MPJ has staggered with the bench a lot along with Gordon and Jamal. Yet that unit has still been an absolute failure on offense, while Jokic + all bench generates an offensive rating equivalent to the best offense ever. It's incredible.

There's so much else we can look at, but another interesting thing is the revival of Westbrook. Westbrook scores more points per 100 possessions on TEN PERCENT BETTER TS% when Jokic is out there (60%) than when he is not (50%). Again, that is an insane difference. He's revived, but somehow only revived when Jokic is on the court.

I'm not even a Nuggets fan, I'm a Celtics fan born and raised. But I do think you could make a great case for this being the GOAT offensive season, and I'm leaning more and more towards actually making that case.",222,114,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ihcvwc/nikola_jokic_is_having_the_best_offensive_season/,2025-02-04 03:08:06,"I think 2022/23 already had a case for the best offensive season ever, and then he decided to shoot 50% from 3(granted he was also better on floaters and on midrange jumpers in 23) , so it's getting hard to make a strong case against it.

  
If he isn't the best offensive player ever, he is almost indisputably the most complete offensive player of all time, and I don't think it's that close. Stephs shooting, Lebron's rim pressure, Magic's playmaking, or Jordan's scoring is more valuable than any one thing he does. But try and come up with another player who is a ultra elite scorer in all 3 levels,  on and off the ball, while also being pretty comfortably the best passer in the NBA, and you are going to struggle to come up with someone even close to that. || The only thing I would say is league average effeciency has increased a lot in recent years. It hovered from 52% to 54% from like the 80s to 2016. And has now jumped up to 57%. I would also say that individual statlines have gotten more ridiculous. Lebron in the 2000s and mid 2010s averaging 27-7-7 was as well rounded as it got, and now there are a lot of guys putting up those kinds of statlines. Now there are 10+ guys averaging a similar statline and even LeBron before this year had basically no drop off in his statline despite clearly not being at his peak levels. 

I say all this to just provide some context. It can definitely still be argued he’s the best offensive player we have seen. || [removed] || [deleted] || Jokic is 100% having an all time great offensive season, but I have an issue with a couple of things

1. I don't think that, If we're talking about the best offensive season ever, we can take 3P% at face value, right? Jokic is averaging 47% from three sure but in 4 3PA/G. 2016 Steph averaged 45% on ELEVEN attempts per game.
2. Scoring is scoring, nothing to argue with that but when you add ""Volume"" scorer, IMO It gets associated with a bunch of shooters, and so we assume Joker is shooting the rock from outside like prime Klay when in reality two thirds of Jokic attempts are within 10ft of the basket.
3. On-Off can tell you how a team looks with or without a player, but It doesn't define how good the player is. Lebron, Harden, Kobe, Embiid, Luka, Russ, had at times monster on-off numbers because the rest of the team sucked without them.

If we keep the ""best offensive season ever"", simple (scoring, assisting, efficiency) I believe he does have a case for that. I still think 30ppg Steph shooting 50-45-90 on 11 threes is the best one. || [removed] || Westbrook’s play is what I noticed. He’s a perfect fit next to Jokic.

Take any player from any season in nba history and jokic is the mvp over them. This is hands down the best season we have ever seen and it isn't particularly close imo. It'll end up going to sga or giannis probably because of voter fatigue but this year and the year embiid won it both should be Jokic. I don't even particularly like him, I'm a lebron and Luka guy, but fuck me jokic is better than anyone I've ever seen rn. || Nice post, but on-off stats can be misleading sometimes, as it's all correlational data. 

The Westbrook connection you allude to is a perfect example of this. Russ definitely gets easier looks when a scorer like Jokic is on the floor, particularly when Jokic is actually passing to to him as a cutter. However, the stats are muddied up by the fact that for most of the last couple of months Russ has been on the floor almost exclusively only when Jokic is too - this was intentional by Malone. Also, these stats highlight how well Russ has played, after being inserted into the starting lineup, where he also has thrived next to Gordon (when he's playing), MPJ, and Braun. 

Most of the stats where Russ was shooting more poorly likely came from early season when he was playing with a terrible, inexperienced, and poorly formed bench unit lacking in outside shooters and defenders. Since then, all the bench units have been completely staggered. So when you say Jokic is playing with the ""bench,"" he's usually playing with two other starters as well. || Jokic is putting up numbers you can only get playing MyCareer. He is that insane || It’s 2016 Steph. Don’t overthink it. No other season is worth a discussion.

Not to mention, he's one of only a handful of guys who will actually throw up a 3/4 court attempt before the clock expires, so his actual 3PT % is higher than what the stats show.

I may be exaggerating curry's number but he still scores 4,2 3pointers per game. It's true that steph curry's record is not optimized which is crazy considering how much above everybody else he is. Curry has lost quite a few hundreds 3 pointers by being born before the curry revolution. Then he also played 3 years in college, also his durability has been very average, 2 big injuries + many missed games every year.\*\* But at the same time

a) it's incrediby tough to beat it. for example if you play an elite 1300 games (24 players in history, chris paul is at 1320) and you manage to have a 3,3 3 pointers per game, you are at 3900, which is his current number (3925). The thing is, currently, after curry (3,9) the 2nd highest is 3,1 (klay) and 3,0 (lillard) btw two players from his generation. some young players that now average around 3,0 can grow of course because they scored less of them in the first few seasons, but it's tough to imagine that it can grow to 3,3 or more, or maybe it can for a bit before going down this mark at the end of their career. Of course they could play more than 1300 games, there have been some guys at 1400, 1500 and even 1 at 1600, but that's incredibly rare and ofc average goes down as total games go up.

b) there havent been elite all time great shooters in the last years, or at least great great shooters that are great players or great shooters that seem to have great longevity. all the guys scoring a lot of 3s are not great shooters. edwards, doncic, tatum, mitchell, all go from decent to good (mitchell), for all of them elite shooting is not the main part of their game, edwards and mitchell are more athletic than shooters, tatum is shot creation at his height and versatility, doncic is overall offensive creation and playmakig. beside this edwards outlier season.

Steph curry's record can be broken, but there needs to be somebody in the league who's an all time great shooter and a great player and that will have great longevity, and for now we don't have anything like that.

\*\*it's tough to have it all, for example stoctkton has those unbeatable records despite not playing a lot his first 3 years, also playing 4 years of college, and also playing at least half of his career in a low pace era. james scoring record on the other hand is pretty optimized. he started playing at 18 when you could go straight out of hs, ofc he has one of the highest career ppg, the first 10 years of his career he played in a low scoring era but now he played more than half in a high scoring one. not totally tho cause he shoots less than other players + he didnt start in a high scoring era. wilt's rebounds record is very optimized cause in those times they averaged damn near double the reboudns and the guy played all the minutes",153,78,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ikd9gj/will_somebody_surpass_steph_currys_record_players/,2025-02-07 21:55:14,"Yes, it’ll happen eventually. 

Curry wasn’t chucking threes quite at the rate he is now when he first entered the league. Not to mention his first few years were plagued with injury. 

You already have players coming in shooting multiple threes a game while remaining healthy. ANT just earned the nod for the youngest player to reach 1000+ threes. ANT is already on pace to do it so long as he stays healthy, and there will undoubtedly be more players who come in who
shoot a lot of threes while remaining healthy

Will Curry be passed as the “greatest” shooter ever? I don’t think so any time soon, but his record will be broken. || Nobody in the league right now is surpassing him.

This recent wave of young NBA talent still was not fully immersed in the 3pt revolution. They may have molded their games around it in HS and college but it’s not the game they grew up playing.

Kids these days are trying to play Steph Curry’s game. It will still take a generational talent to overtake him but they will arrive in the next 20 years imo. || It’ll happen for sure. Curry could stay the greatest ever but he missed a lot of time entering the league late, being the one to revolutionize the 3 means he wasn’t taking as many as he should early in his career, and injuries. || If Silver pushes through with that 10 min quarter, then no, no one is surpassing him... || every record (except maybe wilts 100 and stocktons career assist record due to inflated stats) can be broken. remember, kareem’s record was thought to be unbroken until a few years ago || Steph is sitting at 3925 3PM right now. Let's say he retires with about 4800. That means someone has to average 300 3PM for 16 years. I think that's technically doable, but under the assumption that 3pt FG volume goes way up. Last year, Steph made 357 3PMs. Nobody else in the league made 300.

What would make Steph's record vulnerable? Steph was 21 when he entered the league, so someone who enters as a teenager has a few years head start. Also, Steph didn't even attempt 500 3PAs in a season until his 4th season, and didn't attempt 10 3PAs a game until his seventh season. Add in a few injury-riddled seasons and he left a lot of 3PMs on the table.

That said, if someone else ever makes 402 3PM in a season, I'd be astonished if he made them at a .454 clip. And I'd also be shocked if someone shoots .454 3pt٪ and makes even 350 3PMs. Maybe it can happen if the NBA pushes even softer defenses and teams averaged 130 ppg. || I doubt anyone can make 5000 3 pointers in their career. 
Hypothetically, let's assume a legend comes up at 18 years to the league and plays till he's 38.(Not everyone can be LeBron).
In those 20 years, he'll have to make 250 3s every single year. Considering how most players are only playing in 60-70 games each regular season, it's about (3.4-4.1) 3pm each season. There are 25 players who make more than 3 per game and 12 who make at 3.4 per game.
If you expect 4 per game then it's only 3 players.
Also, the highest ppg by a rookie this year is 15 and 3s is 3 per game.**
Keeping all that in mind, you'd need a  generational player being top 20 in 3s per game and can hit it consistently for more than 20 years and you'll still be lacking a little.
Now let's consider Steph Curry's ceiling.
He's made 3925 3 pointers till now.
He might add another 100-150 by the post season and then 500-600 on top of it.
He'll have a ceiling of 4600-4750.
That's tough to beat. 
The guy has to be generationally good, make 3.5-4 3s a night for over two decades and.... he'll still be under 300-500.
(4×65 =260. 260×20= 4200)
Steph is amazing. You have to realise that everyone shooting 3s might change how the game is, but even so, everyone is sharing the shots, so it's not one guy is making over 5 3s for a whole decade.

Anthony Edwards already have 1K in only 300+ games. 

With the 3pt revolution, the guy who will break his record has already arrived or will be in the next 5 years. || Steph Curry’s first all star season was 11.5 years ago. Anthony edwards was 12. And he’s been in the league for 5 years. Risacher was 8 lol. Paolo was 11. Wemby was 9-10. These dudes definitely group up in Stephs shadow || Ant? He already has like 27% of Steph’s record and he’s like 22 || >Nobody in the league right now is surpassing him

That’s a strong statement. Anthony Edwards clearly has a chance if he plays long the like and doesn’t get injured. I’m not saying he will with that high of a chance but it’s clearly greater than 0 percent. 

No one should ever make absolute statements like this.  || The fact that Curry wasn't an all-star player at the beginning of his career will make his record more accessible to break.

Records can be incredibly specific so no, there are many records that can't be broken. but even As far as career totals in the 5 major categories wilt's 24k rebouds is unbeatable cause at the time there were damn near double the total rebounds. also wilt lacks longevity but played all the minutes. and ofc he was an incredible rebounder. duncan has the most between players drafted after 75 and he has just 15k. if blocks were recorded earlier wilt/bill blocks record would also be unbreakable cause they were 2 freaks and there were so many more blocks because of shots being closer to the rim on average.  stockton assist and steals record is also pretty unbreakable, not because of ""inflated stats"" but because that's what you get when you combine goat level longevity (6th in total games) with 2nd in career average apg and 7th steals. So that leaves us with lebron's record. Lebron's record is theorically beatable because of the fact that lebron's career average points of 27 is one of the highest but not the highest, especially now if the average stay this high. but still it's incredibly difficult cause lebron will probably end up being 1st in total games played. Lebron will finish this season over 42k points, i expect him to play 2 other seasons, but 1 is also possible so lets estimate 44-45k.

The context is that you have Luka Doncic and Lebron James with a glaring hole at center. 

They filled that hole with a complete wild card, if he hits anywhere near his short term upside he absolutely moves the needle as a lob threat for the most dangerous jumbo playmaking duo of all time. || Just want to point out that a lot of people are misunderstanding the question IMO. It's not that Mark Williams is so good he makes the Lakers a contender, it's that they have a top 3 player in the league, a top 10 player in the league, and a hole at C. Mark Williams, if he's plays like an average or slightly above average C erases that hole. || If you have been watching them lately they have been playing very well. Last few wins have been without AD. You add Luka, who just took the Mavs to the Finals, and a young center to the mix, I think they are definitely contenders. Not favorites, but contenders none the less. || I think Luka and LeBron have both taken lesser teams deep into the playoffs. Are they contenders? Maybe not for the title, but I don’t think anyone is gonna like having to play them. They’ll be a problem, at the very least, for any team. || I think so. Luka has great playoff success with different rosters, the Lakers look like they’re world beaters right now with 9 wins of they’re last 11, counting really impressive performances against the Celtics, Clippers and Knicks (both those games without AD and Max). 

If the game slow downs a bit in the playoffs, Luka and LeBron will have insane matchup hunting potential, leaving the teams 3rd best guard defender having the task of stopping Reaves, who’s also shown he can contribute greatly in a playoff setting. 

Obviously, it’s a matchup dependent sport and they might simply get the Nuggets on a 4-5 seed matchup and be swept, but honestly if the team keeps trending up they can finish even top 3-4 in the West and dodge a trickier matchup early. I think this current version of the Lakers is perfectly capable on winning a long series against any team in the west. I simply seen Luka do too much to crazy teams, from Kawhi + PG tandem, to CP3 and Booker, Wolves last year, he’s a psycho and side by side with this rejuvenated version of LeBron, having good switchable wings like DFS and Vanderbilt, added scoring power in Rui Hachimura and a competent C rotation of Williams + Hayes, honestly, anything is possible. || I like mark williams a lot. I think he’s been overrated last couple of days. I’m not convinced he’s ready for the big show, and they’re going to rely on him a LOT. 

Offensively i think he’ll be fine. Luka and Bron will make life easy for him. Defensively, he’s going to be tasked with holding together a pretty abysmal defensive unit. AD is a top 3-5 defender in the league and was barely doing so. Williams has talent but he’s not an elite defender right now. || I feel like Dark Horse is a good way to describe them. Not truly a top contender like Boston, Cleveland, OKC, or Denver. But they feel like they’re in the next tier of teams that are the “everything has to go right and they have to get a little lucky” group. 

If things get weird in the West during the playoffs, they could wind up in the finals. But I wouldn’t run out to put money on it. Anything can happen with a healthy and motivated LeBron and Luka. || This Lakers team is much better than the mavs team that made the wcf back in 2022. With Luka you’re always gonna have a chance. Though idk about their chances vs okc. || I think they are in a tier below OKC, BOS and CLE but might be the top of that tier if healthy. || If Mark Williams stays healthy and gels with the big 2, I can see the Lakers being a contender. I'd put them in the Memphis, Rockets, Knicks, Bucks tier of contenders. Their D is going to be pretty suspect considering they'll be starting Luka-Reaves-Lebron. || Mark Williams is probably still a couple years away.  He’s not on the same timeline as Bron, and while it might be a great trade in the future I don’t think it moves the needle enough this year. || Rui, Vando and DFS are the reason they will be contenders. This trio has been killing it lately. Lock down defense from Vando and DFS plus a three point threat from DFS and Rui. They have also been dominant on rebounds. || [removed] || I like Mark Williams.

He probably isn't even a top 20 center in the league yet.  Now maybe he gets reenergized by playing with Lebron and Luka, who will get him the easiest looks of his life, but I don't think he elevates them to being true contenders. || Idk if Mark Williams makes that much of a difference but he does fill a gap and if you have LeBron and Luka I will take you seriously against any team in a best of 7 and they seem to be on target to get a pretty damn good seed, potentially even home court for a series. 

I worry a bit about the defensive side of the ball but I assume come playoff time LeBron will crank it up, especially with Luka (and Reaves to an extent) able to handle some heavy lifting offense. Plus this offense on paper should be absurd. 

One thing I could actually see being a concern is just the playoff grind on 40 year old LeBron once you get past that first round. If they can get to the finals and that extra rest sure, but those every other day wars will be tough. 

Are they contenders? I’d lean yes. Can they actually take down a team like OKC? I think Luka and LeBron will have to be very special, which is entirely possible but I’d pick OKC. || do people truly hate the lakers or does this sub truly lack context and comprehension? wtf are these comments lol. || I think they were pretty good the other nite but it’s something will have to see, if the lakers make the post season and wanna win they’ll have to go through okc and nuggets both with amazing center play not to mention Dallas. Pick n roll they definitely be really good as for the defensive aspect will have to see || I’m gonna go ahead and say that if anything made them contenders, the Luka trade made them contenders.

Williams is good, and they needed a center, so he helps for sure, but that’s not changing their destiny.

It all gonna come down to Luka and Lebron and how well they play together, and if they can put together legitimate defense. || Don't let Lakers fan see this. 1 dude last night on a post legit said LA should be the favorites currently lmfaoo || Yes. DFS and Mark Williams are already good players to put next to LeBron and Luka. Williams may be young but his role is a little more forgiving, and it won’t be so different to what it just was on the hornets. Their 1-5 is scary. Their bench? Potentially the worst in the playoffs. And long term, it’s terrifying that a bad team with no centers said, “Those back injuries are too much. Let’s ship him for 1 late first and replace him with the worst player in the league.” || The West seems pretty open, so no reason they can't get to the WCF which is the definition of contending. || He's played like 80 career games. He doesn't have any playoff experience, but if all he needs to do is catch lobs and grab rebounds he might be okay. || Definitely have a much better chance than before, but OKC/Boston are the only “true” contenders to me, as in teams I give a significant portion of likelihood to. 

In the West it probably goes

3. Knicks

**Transaction Notes:**

We can debate the merits of remaining competitive but once we accept that as a goal, there probably wasn’t a better deal on the market. Luka is a free agent in the summer of 2026 so whoever is trading for him has to convince him to re-sign in less than 18 months. Imagine a world where the Rockets empty the clip and trade Sengun + Amen + picks for Luka, why would he re-sign with that team with all of his other options on the table?

Luka is going to have his pick of any team in the league in the summer of 2026. Cap space doesn’t really matter when a player of Luka’s calibre is on the market. Every team will be a suitor. I’ve been following the NBA for a long time and there have been countless examples (anyone remember Butler to Miami being impossible because of cap space) of this.

If Luka wants to play with Wemby, the Spurs will make it happen. If he wants to play with Jokic, the Nuggets will make it happen. If he wants to play with Tatum, the Celtics will make it happen. If he wants to play with Giannis, the Bucks will make it happen. This is what the Lakers are up against and I suspect how they were able to hold back assets in the deal. It has already been reported that they asked to speak to Luka about signing an extension before the trade and were denied permission. 

The Mavs should have extracted more value from the Lakers (I think a trade of AD + Reaves for Luka would have been accurate pricing) but certainly not AD + Reaves + Christie + both picks and all possible swaps like I’ve seen others propose. 

**Luka Notes:**

Luka is out of shape for an NBA player. Yes, he’s still a tremendous player but I think the pendulum has swung too far on this. Citing his minutes load as evidence of his shape is silly, you can play lots of minutes while being out of shape, your fitness affects what you do during those minutes.  It’s a testament to his skill level that he’s still able to play as well as he does despite this but it is a real issue. The all time greats Luka is compared to had kinks to work out but nobody would ever accuse them of not trying to squeeze every ounce of talent out of their bodies. 

I have never read an article about LeBron, Jordan, Kobe, Duncan, KG, Giannis being so flagrantly out of shape. Jokic famously took a leap when he decided he wanted to take his body seriously and stopped drinking three 2L bottles of coke every day. Many hoped that after last year’s bitter defeat in the Finals Luka would come into this year committed to fitness and diet. Instead there were articles about him smoking cigarettes and drinking beer during the Olympics. Mavs fans will never admit it now but just go into their subreddit and type “Luka conditioning” to see their unvarnished thoughts. 

Luka has a lot of what I would call “non-winning” habits. He doesn’t impact the defensive side of the ball, he doesn’t set good screens, he doesn’t box out, he doesn’t move without the ball, he doesn’t change ends quickly, he doesn’t fight over or through screens, he’s never first to the floor etc. 

This is all great news for Luka because there’s so much room for improvement. He’s honestly barely scratched the surface of the player he could be if he became more serious about the game. The bad news is that we’re 7 years into his career and there hasn’t really been another star of his calibre I can think of that took this long to become “serious”. Many people say you either have it or you don’t and the Mavs had a front row seat to him and decided that he wasn’t going to change. Luka is well beyond Embiid as a playoff performer but Embiid is example of the issues that can arise when a superstar player never “grows up” and commits themselves to the small, mundane things that lead to winning. 

**Lakers Notes:**

The Lakers were closer to competing for a title this year prior to the Luka trade than they were generally given credit for. A lot of people wrote them off after their early season slump but since Dec 5th the Lakers have gone 20-9 with the #4 defence and #8 offence in the NBA. In this stretch AD/Luka (treating them as one player) missed 9 games.

The Lakers’ window is not as wide as people believe. Luka on his own without a second star is not going anywhere worthwhile and it’s unlikely the Lakers will sign anyone better than current LeBron. For example, the big star free agent in the summer of 2026 is JJJ — current LeBron is 2-3 tiers above JJJ. LeBron is 40 and his play is very much year to year at this point. The Lakers don’t have as much time as it may seem. 

It should not be lost on anyone that the Lakers did not skip a beat and in fact played better in AD’s absence. Anthony Davis is an incredibly talented player but his impact on the court is overstated because people have a tendency to think basketball is the sum total of offensive and defensive ability as if they are discrete and separate parts of the game. It’s really difficult to have a great defence when your center is a non shooter who mostly plays around the basket because after they’ll very often end the offensive possession near the hoop and therefore behind the play in transition or semi-transition. 

AD’s struggles changing ends was one of the largest under-discussed issues with the Lakers’ defence over the last few years. In today’s NBA it’s really difficult to have a non-shooting big be a large part of your offense because of how important floor balance and early transition defence is. IF Luka is serious about playing defence, I think the Lakers actually match up better against teams with great bigs because their center will be 100% focused on defensive responsibilities. 

All in all this is one of the most fascinating trades in NBA history and one that I think will challenge a lot of what has become “conventional wisdom” about NBA team building.

Is this why Porzingis shoots from above the break, so it's easier for him to get back on defense?

Is there a way to see the impact of how well a player runs the floor? Why is it so under-discussed? Is the impact really that much? || Why do we have to accept there wasn't a better deal on the market? This trade was bungled so badly that Nico Harrison could not even extract all of LA's assets. He didn't even get the best deal under what seemed to be his own self-imposed restriction that he wanted AD and no one else.

A player of Luka's calibre at his age has never been traded. We don't know how teams would react. Teams spend years building up assets to have the ammunition to chase stars if they become available. || I don't agree with your assessment of Luka's situation. In particular when you say he has a lot of ""non-winning habits""... But he still brings wins at an elite rate/level, so perhaps what we should reconsider if they really are ""non-winning habits""?

You cite Kobe, I think that's a good view on how ""winning habits"" can be unexpected. Sure, Kobe has an elite winning mentality and focus, and excellent conditioning. But he also clashed with Phil Jackson and with Shaq, to a certain extent being the catalyst for a team that had won 3 titles and lost one final in 5 years to break up. Despite Jackson coming back a year later, it took the Gasol trade to really bring the team back to where it had been (a trade that even at the time was seen as... favorable to the Lakers). 

Luka seems to be a pretty easy-going team-mate, and despite being a hugely ball-dominant player he's adapted his play each season to play well with whoever is on the roster. Isn't getting the maximum out of your team-mates, in particular in a small-market team a hugely valuable winning habit?

Are there ways Doncic can improve even further and be truly a once-in-a-generation player? Yes. Pretty much every player can and does. LeBron worked to add a mid-range shot after the 2007 finals where the Spurs highlighted this gap in his offensive toolset, for example. Would it be great if Doncic is 100% committed to improving his game to be this once-in-a-generation player, and agrees with the Mavs organization that his conditioning and defensive effort is the gap he needs to work on? Sure!

But the Mavs can't have their cake and eat it too. 

They're not the Lakers or other big-market teams that can attract stars. They've been to 3 finals in 45 years. 1 in 6 years with Doncic, who's not yet in his prime. Doncic was according to all reports happy in Dallas, which is an incredible stroke of luck. LeBron dropped the Cavs, just like AD and KD did to their small-market teams to seek rings/success. Getting a top-5 player for the next 6-7 years is *incredibly* good for a team like the Mavs!

Doncic might not have LeBron or Kobe's grindset mentality. He will probably never be a hyper-conditioned player like Giannis, partly because of this mindset issue, but also because athleticism isn't a major part of his playing style. But like Jokic, he has plenty of other skills / qualities that are much, much more valuable to the organization. You say Jokic improved considerably after shedding weight... Is Jokic at his ideal weight now? He's considerably heavier than AD, Markkanen or Wemby for example. Would he be -*even better*\- by dropping 30 or 50 lbs? Some would say yes - he'd be faster in defense, more agile and able to jump a little higher. Others would say no - he would lose some of the weight advantage that he leverages so well to push defenders back and create space for himself and team-mates. Similarly, would leaner, meaner Doncic be better for the organization, getting pissed off that his efforts aren't being rewarded due to the Mavs' limited ability to surround him with top-level players? Would it be better for the Mavs if he cut his weight for a season then leaves the team to chase a ring like KD or LeBron did? 

However you look at it, the result is that he's taken the Mavs to a final in his 6th season after joining the league at 19. He was committed to the team and reaching a level of success that the organization has had so rarely it's almost anecdotal. How you can square that with having a lot of ""non-winning habits"" as a reason to trade him is frankly surprising to me. || I think the most interesting thing is the Mavs are probably the best team ever to deliberately take a step back mid season with a trade.

Before the trade, they were a consensus second tier contender behind OKC, Boston and  Cleveland, together with Denver and NY. After the trade, the most frequent question was if they can avoid the play-in, and I haven’t seen anyone seriously consider that they can make the conference finals.

Moreover, this is an improved version of last year’s finals team, with more talent, deeper roster, and more versatile options for lineups and even play style. And it’s not like now or never, they had everything under control for 2 more seasons after this, with picks and assets to improve on the margins. || LeBron being 2-3 tiers above JJJ is absolutely insane. He is maximum 1 tier above. LBJ is an All-NBA level player, JJJ All-NBA/high level All-Star. || Every, single, fuckin time anthony davis goes for a layup, he goes flying past the rim on the and falls to the ground, and the other team if they are any good score in transition on a 4v5. || [removed] || It was the type of lopsided trade that would only happen for the Lakers. That is the most irritating part to me. Unlike most teams the Lakers never have to find superstars in the draft.

Dallas will never again have a player with Luka's insane combination of talent and popularity. That makes him priceless. Yet they gave him away for nothing (compared to other recent deals). Combine that with the unethical secrecy and the lack of shopping him around, it is hard to not be left with a sour taste in your mouth regardless of what team you support. The general feeling is Luka, who was the best thing ever to Dallas fans, was stolen. || Porzingas, Brunson and now Doncic. One season removed from making the nba finals to probably being destined to peak in the 2nd round with this squad. If you trade a guy that is probably 70-80% of the fanbase you better hope you’re replacing him with someone of equal value. The alternate route would be crowning else who’s younger or needs more opportunity your new franchise player (like Brunson) 

Mavs front office didn’t even try and stockpile a bunch of first rounders like Presti did for OKC. They haven’t really developed any young prospects so there wasn’t really a dual timeline.

Klay, Kyrie and AD would’ve been sick…9 years ago when they were all in their prime. One of the craftiest combo guards paired with an elite two way off ball 3pt sniper and a two way athletic beast with playmaking abilities in the front court. Throw in some quality role players around that and you have yourself a title team in today’s NBA. 

Mavs don’t really have an untouchable level player at this point. With AD in the mix they’ve really double down on old injury prone guys. Don’t get me wrong AD is still a top 10-20 player when healthy, but he rarely is. You’d think teams would’ve learned after the aging stars didn’t pan out for the Clippers. || I think long winded analysis is just an attempt to make something fundamentally senseless make sense .

Doncic is not a perfect player but he is a potential top 20 all time with 5-10 exceptional years ahead of him..simply put, with the right supporting cast he is good enough to carry a franchise to multiple championships and his value on the open market reflects that. The trade is controversial and newsworthy for the reason everyone thinks it is- because Dallas threw away a franchise player for far far less than he is worth.

There isn't some underlying logic to it, all that happened in this instance is a perfect storm of an immature and not very smart GM failing to appreciate that superstars often come with baggage or shortcomings and you pretty much accept that, an inexperienced owner who knows nothing about basketball, and  failed to appreciate the enormity of what he was being asked to sign off onand a much more experienced GM who was wily enough to leverage his personal relationship with that other GM to both sucker him into the trade and -amazingly-  talk him into keeping it secret to avoid the absolute feeding frenzy which would have ensured if Doncic was available on the open market.

Or to put it more succinctly. Nico is an idiot and Pelinka saw him coming. || >T his is what the Lakers are up against and I suspect how they were able to hold back assets in the deal. It has already been reported that they asked to speak to Luka about signing an extension before the trade and were denied permission . . . .  The Mavs should have extracted more value from the Lakers (I think a trade of AD + Reaves for Luka would have been accurate pricing) but certainly not AD + Reaves + Christie + both picks and all possible swaps like I’ve seen others propose.

Yeah I think that's what people miss - even a great player, there's only so much that a team is going to pay for what just a season and a half rental of a guy who hadn't played in 2 months. It was similar to why Toronto got such a good deal for Kawhi Leonard. In both cases the guy immediately got healthy after going to his new team, but that wasn't a certainty when the trade was made || Bro is expecting Luka to come out with a six pack… that’s not ever going to even be Luka.. Dallas main problem with Luka is he was skipping out of summer camp, he was always in shape just couldn’t find a rhythm I believe it was because he didn’t attend summer camp/pre game etc.. || I'll also throw out that the Luka trade made so many of Nico's prior moves retroactively worse. Like, if you agree to a pick swap when everyone in your rotation is going to be 30, then oh well. You're expecting to be, at worst, trading a late 1st for a later 1st. We've got pick swaps waiting to go off when just about everyone in the rotation is going to be retired now. || It’s crazy you’re blaming AD’s transition defense like LeBron isn’t the one trying to get him to sit corner and stretch the floor. Also like LeBron and the wings aren’t supposed to be the transition defenders. 

This is why Jordan’s Bulls were so elite. Him and Pippen took away transition opportunities and forced you to play half court basketball. This is why the Spurs were elite in 2013+ Kawhi and Danny Green dominated the transition defense forcing everyone to play half court basketball. This is also why the Celtics just won a championship… Brown and Tatum are taking away all the easy transition baskets, forcing guys to play half court ball… but on the Lakers it’s Davis fault for not getting back meanwhile LeBron (&Luka) are 2 of the slowest defensive players in the league. || This trade have 0 basketball schematics involved in it. 

It's a decision forced by the top dogs who we don't know about for money reasons.

This is a win for the league cause luka on the most sellable franchise in the lakers. Mavs ownership want mavs in las vegas and this is also a win for nba front office. Etc2.

If mavs FO announced that luka wanted out. They could've gotten atleast 7 first round offers from atleast 5 teams. mavs front office don't even need to ask cause great offers will be abundant. Instead they specifically wanted the trade to be with the lakers. || I don't think Lebron is 2 tiers above JJJ lol. JJJ is probably gonna make all nba and Bron might not. They're in the same tier this year.

Anyways you're right Luka playing next to Bron means he's gonna have to grow up. No more bullshit ""Golden Boy"" leeway. It's time to win NOW.

Lukas relationship with Kyrie was a summertime boy-ish friendship built on love of the game and doing cool fun trickshots in practice.

Lukas relationship with Bron is going to be mentorship and learning how to win championships.

How is Luka going to react to Bron losing his shit at him?

How is Luka going to react to JJ Reddick yelling at him and coaching him hard?

This is Lukas opportunity to grow out of his boyhood and learn what it means to win championships.

He made it to the Finals- cool. So did Dwight Howard. Honestly Dwight and Luka have a lot in common when you look at their resumes and personalities.

Bron doesn't give a fuck that you went to the Finals once. That doesn't mean anything to him or the Lakers organizations. 

Mavs fans treated Luka like a God because he took them there once. Well, making the finals is the BARE MINIMUM now. Chips are the expectation and I'm not sure Luka is ready for that pressure. || I strongly disagree with there not being a better deal on the market but you make lots of good points about everything else. 


Good post op || ""The bad news is that we’re 7 years into his career and there hasn’t really been another star of his calibre I can think of that took this long to become “serious”""
Man has more all NBA 1st teams than Steph Curry. He had ONE serious enough team and took them to the finals. My tinfoil hat makes me want to ask whether you're paid by Nico and his goons.
Reality is he's one of one. Only Jokic is better and only Giannis can even talk because he won and he is that caliber of player. But his game WILL age worse than Lukas (and Jokic)
Selling him is like selling your kidney and being like ""but Ive gotten $2000 in return! I really like 2000!"" || It really is. Two teams with looming problems getting together and solving it in the most unconventional of ways. Doncic may have been on the less athletic side, but that wasn't the real reason. It was money. They couldn't give him the supermax and realistically field a championship winning team.They were caught in a situation where most teams would be forced to dole out an albatross contract, hoping everything else just falls in place at the right time. Lakers mortgaged their future, and AD was looking more and more like a player that you couldn't make the cornerstone once Bron (eventually) left. He can stay healthy, but he's still inconsistent. He's every bit as likey to give you a 13 point game as he is to give you a 30 point game. LA didn't want another decade of offering bad contracts as they search for a star big enough to be attracted by the big lights of Lakerland. Two bros doing each other a serious solid. Lol. || You can drive yourself crazy with this trade because it makes no basketball sense to make it but if you look at it through the lenses of the owner’s motivations it makes more sense. 

The Owners are not basketball people, their biggest venture is right now is trying turn the AAC into a casino complex. But with sports gambling illegal in Texas they have to look for a different route. Since the NBA already wants a team in Vegas, the plan would be to have the Mavericks relocated to Vegas. Now it’s hard to justify moving a team that is consistently making the playoffs/finals with Luka because the fan base is behind it and making good money. But if the team is bad and the fans are not engaged with the team or even hate the team outright, discussions would be had to move the team to a market that will financially support it. What’s one way to piss off an entire fan base? Trade away your homegrown generational talent with no warning in the middle of the night so there’s no chance to sway the decision in the court of public opinion. So the owners are financially incentivized for the team to be bad and its value to go in the tank because it serves their interests and makes it easier to move the team.

Adam Silver was 100% involved and he will take that to the grave. || Great post, but saying Bron is 2-3 tiers above Trip in 2025 when one is on his way out and the other is hitting his prime is laughable.

The Mavs traded a better player for a worse player who is also significantly older and with a bigger injury history.

They did so in the middle of the night at the trade deadline and bartered with just one team. And this is coming off a finals birth not even one calendar year apart.

When the GM making this trade has to laugh off the long term because he knows it's an outrageous trade, there's nothing that's defensible about it.

There is a reason we have never seen a trade like this ever in basically any sport.

I guess the fascinating part is from the side of the Lakers. Somehow they keep hoodwinking these teams into making trades like this. || Giannis for Luka was possible. 

There 100000% was better players and deals to be made. But when the Lakers GM gives you money under the table, you accept it. ",0.0,0.725,0.275,0.5849,0.056,0.796,0.148,0.9986,0.084,0.754,0.162,0.9998

Age 40. Season 22. No one in the game has had this kind of longevity. The only player who came close to this is Kareem. (Sidebar: I'll always find it curious how few people called Kareem the GOAT based on longevity when MJ was around, but now call LeBron the GOAT based on longevity... But I digress..).

Even at age 40, Bron is continuing to stuff the stat sheet. Let's look at the basic, raw box stats:

24.3 PPG (51.5/39.4/76.1)
7.7 RPG
9.0 APG

Age 40 and he's doing this? Looks incredible!

Now let's start looking beneath the surface. At efficiency and impact on the game.

Per DunksAndThrees:
OffEPM 2.5 (33rd in the NBA)
DefEPM -0.5 (300th in the NBA)
EPM 2.1 (54th in the NBA, basically tied with Austin Reaves)

Offense is chugging along, but the defense is gone. He's 40 and playing one side of the court to conserve energy. Makes sense, I guess.

Now for on court impact (per Cleaning the Glass):

Efficiency differential -8.1 (team points scored per 100 possessions minus team points allowed per 100 possessions). -8.1 puts LeBron in the 15th percentile in the NBA in efficiency differential and is the lowest of his entire career by far. In fact, he's NEVER been negative in this. Even as a rookie he was +1.9. And just last season LeBron was +8.3 and in the 88th percentile in the league.

Expected wins -19 (How many games would a team win in an 82 game season with this efficiency differential?). Once again, he's negative for the first time in his career. Just last season his expected wins was +20.

Points per 100 possessions: -3.5. Again, the first time he's been negative for points per 100 possessions in his entire career. -3.5 points/poss is the 28th percentile in the league.

Across the board, it looks like his efficiency and impact have fallen off a cliff, despite the solid raw box counting stats. Which brings us to last night...

Hornets vs Lakers: A Closer Look.

People are criticizing Luka. Especially a lot of Bron fans. And I get it. Luka's raw box score numbers looked terrible! And Bron's raw box score numbers looked pretty good. But let's dig a little deeper again and check impact.

Luka on: +17.1 Net. Luka off: -41.2 Net.
Bron on: -5 Net. Bron off: +10.6 Net.

Holy shit. The Lakers were +10.6 Net with Bron off the floor? And they were -41.2 Net with Luka off the floor, but +17.1 Net with Luka on it? Shocking.

In short, raw box scores can be very deceiving. You can score all the points you want, but if you do so inefficiently and/or play no defense, it won't matter much in terms of actually impacting winning games. It's been said that ""every team has a leading scorer, even the bad ones."" 

It's hard not to come away with the conclusion that Father Time has indeed caught up with LeBron, but it's not reflected in raw box scores (posted from Real and elsewhere). It's reflected in efficiency and impact. LeBron is getting his numbers, but at what cost to the team? 

The Lakers have a great record so far, but that was Anthony Davis around, who is one of the best defenders in the NBA. The perfect counterpart for a 40 year old LeBron who coasts on defense to save energy. Now LeBron is paired up with Luka, who, if anything, is a lot like him. A ball dominant, one way player. They have time to figure things out, but losses to the Jazz and Hornets could be a sign of things to come. The Lakers have had one of the easiest schedules in the league up until this point. They now have the 6th toughest remaining schedule strength.

Things will come together as they get more reps and find that comfort level between LeBron, Luka, and the Lakers kind of find their way. Without AD the Lakers just went on a great run and are at worst an above average team still || For the first time in a long, long time LeBron has no pressure to win. I'm a Lakers fan, we're rocking a center rotation of Hayes and Len. We absolutely will not win anything with those 2 playing real minutes. Trading AD for Luka made us worse in the short-term but much, much better long-term.

I've seen a tonne of LeBron basketball. He's been in decline for a bit. He's 40 that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. I do think right now, the way he plays regular season basketball is hurting his team. I also don't think it really matters, for the reasons mentioned above. The real test will be his impact in meaningful games, based on what I saw at the Olympics I definitely think LeBron can be the #2 option on a very good basketball team. The Lakers have their eye on the future, so unfortunately we might have seen all the meaningful basketball were gonna get from LeBron. 10 finals appearances, a gazillion playoff games, he's given us more than we can ask. Time to just enjoy the end of the ride. || Use your eyes. Lebron is paired with the worse parts of the Lakers rotations. Charlotte hunted Luka to win the game. || > Offense is chugging along, but the defense is gone. He's 40 and playing one side of the court to conserve energy. Makes sense, I guess.

Old Kareem was that way too.  Seems like anyone at that age has either their offense or defense vanish, even if the other end stays at a high level.

For examples the other way, Tim Duncan and Karl Malone both were still great defenders in their final seasons, but their scoring ability had declined quite a bit. || Stats are very deceiving in the modern NBA. I think he should retire but he won't do that until after next season because Bronny is retiring that same year || LeBron can still play at the highest level possible and look like the best player in the world he just can’t do it all game anymore. The coasting on defense is most definitely helping mitigate his stamina and allowing him play defense and offense in the 4th when it really matters. I don’t really see him having an actual huge drop off but he will probably continue to slowly decline. I may get hate for this but I think with AD he would’ve been done in a year to two because bron was still having to run everything and AD doesn’t really control the offense. With Luka once he gets settled I can see lebron playing a lot more off ball and being a spot up shooter which should allow him to have more stamina for key moments. I also would think that this would extend how long he can and may want to play not having to put the entire team on his back every night. It’s also contingent on LA building a competent team around him and Luka where he can coast on defense and offense when needed. So yes I think Father Time has slowly started to catch up with him but it only really has changed how much of a game he can 100%. I still see him being a mid 20s and 7+ plus assist and rebound a night guy years down the line if he doesn’t have to carry the team like he has to do most do his career. || Anything to deflect the blame off the guy charlottes was hunting last night. || On the defensive end yes. On the offensive end not very much. He’s even a better 3pt shooter now than he ever was || While it’s obvious that this is the worst season LeBron has played in his career and his defense is probably the worst it’s ever been, I think these advanced stats actually do a worse job of telling the story than traditional box scores do. The Lakers currently have an inefficient, out of shape co-star that is still building chemistry and a below average bench. LeBron currently leads the lakers in minutes per game and according to nbarotations.info, usually takes the floor again without Reaves and Rui, who provide quality defense and open up the floor for different offensive scenarios. Comparing efficiency and +/- is useful when looking at an individual team and determining rotations, but you lose a lot of context when you compare between teams. To me, looking at these numbers knowing LeBron plays significant minutes with lesser talent on the floor shows that the team feels LeBron offers enough upside to give the other players a rest. If LeBron only played with the best lineups, his numbers would be better. You can say LeBron no longer “elevates” his teammates or makes up for a bad roster like he used to, but at the end of the day looking at a guy comparing these numbers for a guy who takes the court with Christian Koloko and Shake Milton is going to have worse numbers by default than say, a guy who is on a team like the Knicks who keep their rotations much tighter. || And he just had another 40 point game after this last night lmao. If anything he’s somehow better than his age 39 season? || I'm late to this discussion but there is another layer to this.   On pbpstats Lebron's 3 point shooting luck when on and off the court is quite unlucky.  When Lebron is on the court, his teammates even on open possessions have forgotten how to shoot.  On the court, they go nuclear from 3.  Swings like this happen all time.  SGA's season is getting juiced even more than it should be by 3 point shooting luck when he is on and off the court in the reverse direction.  Lebron has benefitted from these swings at various times in his career, but this isn't the first time it has happened, but it is the most dramatic example.  In 2018 he almost had a negative on/off.  EPM and DRtg capture this and make his defense look a lot worse than it actually is in this particular season.  It has started to normalize though. || All this advanced stats go out of the window if you watch games but why do that right, no seriours person will watch the last Lakers game and say that Luka was better than LBJ.

In short advanced stats can be deceiving as well if you are using them to further our own agenda and throw context out of the window.

Lakers started they best run when they went small and AD was out.

But not much is expected of a dude who is a Warriors fan and spends his time on reddit hating on LeBron (in order to prop Curry ) and using kindergarten talking points.

And the most hilarious is trying to mask it as thoughful discussion in this sub.

One other thing that is funny is that since Lebron took a week off he has been balling and pushing his team into the standings. || It's a great analysis by OP. LeBron is slowing down. A lot of turnovers. Passing like crap. Little to no defense. Father Time is undefeated. What happens next is nagging small injuries pile up or a devastating Achilles or knee injury occurs or both.

1) Rather than have the G-League champions play in the FIBA Club World Cup, I think the NBA champs should be participating instead. 

The simple argument is that it's hard to call yourself the ""world champs"" when your league is largely domestic. 

The slightly more complex argument would be that we all know a team as stacked as Team USA that starts with Lebron at the top and someone like Jaylen Brown as the 12th man would be heavily favoured (though you could make the argument the gap is slowly but surely closing) against any club team, what would a team with Lebron at the top at Koloko at the bottom do against a top club team like Real Madrid or Olympiacos? I think it'd be a lot of fun to watch.

2) Domestic tournaments would be a fun way to grow the game - basically how the British FA Cup gives teams from lower leagues the opportunity to play Premier League teams. There are a few lower professional leagues in North America, from the CEBL in Canada to the ABA. Including NCAA and U Sports teams would be a cool wrinkle too. The relationship of NBA and G-League teams might pose a bit of a problem.

3) Relegation would be fun, but impossible to do with the way pro sports are setup here.

I imagine there are nuances between the FIFA, FIBA, and NBA ecosystems that I'm missing, but the NBA's support has the potential to dramatically grow the game in North America and give more players the opportunity to play professionally in domestic markets rather than have to move to Europe or Asia.

Things will come together as they get more reps and find that comfort level between LeBron, Luka, and the Lakers kind of find their way. Without AD the Lakers just went on a great run and are at worst an above average team still || For the first time in a long, long time LeBron has no pressure to win. I'm a Lakers fan, we're rocking a center rotation of Hayes and Len. We absolutely will not win anything with those 2 playing real minutes. Trading AD for Luka made us worse in the short-term but much, much better long-term.

I've seen a tonne of LeBron basketball. He's been in decline for a bit. He's 40 that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. I do think right now, the way he plays regular season basketball is hurting his team. I also don't think it really matters, for the reasons mentioned above. The real test will be his impact in meaningful games, based on what I saw at the Olympics I definitely think LeBron can be the #2 option on a very good basketball team. The Lakers have their eye on the future, so unfortunately we might have seen all the meaningful basketball were gonna get from LeBron. 10 finals appearances, a gazillion playoff games, he's given us more than we can ask. Time to just enjoy the end of the ride. || Use your eyes. Lebron is paired with the worse parts of the Lakers rotations. Charlotte hunted Luka to win the game. || > Offense is chugging along, but the defense is gone. He's 40 and playing one side of the court to conserve energy. Makes sense, I guess.

Old Kareem was that way too.  Seems like anyone at that age has either their offense or defense vanish, even if the other end stays at a high level.

For examples the other way, Tim Duncan and Karl Malone both were still great defenders in their final seasons, but their scoring ability had declined quite a bit. || Stats are very deceiving in the modern NBA. I think he should retire but he won't do that until after next season because Bronny is retiring that same year || LeBron can still play at the highest level possible and look like the best player in the world he just can’t do it all game anymore. The coasting on defense is most definitely helping mitigate his stamina and allowing him play defense and offense in the 4th when it really matters. I don’t really see him having an actual huge drop off but he will probably continue to slowly decline. I may get hate for this but I think with AD he would’ve been done in a year to two because bron was still having to run everything and AD doesn’t really control the offense. With Luka once he gets settled I can see lebron playing a lot more off ball and being a spot up shooter which should allow him to have more stamina for key moments. I also would think that this would extend how long he can and may want to play not having to put the entire team on his back every night. It’s also contingent on LA building a competent team around him and Luka where he can coast on defense and offense when needed. So yes I think Father Time has slowly started to catch up with him but it only really has changed how much of a game he can 100%. I still see him being a mid 20s and 7+ plus assist and rebound a night guy years down the line if he doesn’t have to carry the team like he has to do most do his career. || Anything to deflect the blame off the guy charlottes was hunting last night. || On the defensive end yes. On the offensive end not very much. He’s even a better 3pt shooter now than he ever was || While it’s obvious that this is the worst season LeBron has played in his career and his defense is probably the worst it’s ever been, I think these advanced stats actually do a worse job of telling the story than traditional box scores do. The Lakers currently have an inefficient, out of shape co-star that is still building chemistry and a below average bench. LeBron currently leads the lakers in minutes per game and according to nbarotations.info, usually takes the floor again without Reaves and Rui, who provide quality defense and open up the floor for different offensive scenarios. Comparing efficiency and +/- is useful when looking at an individual team and determining rotations, but you lose a lot of context when you compare between teams. To me, looking at these numbers knowing LeBron plays significant minutes with lesser talent on the floor shows that the team feels LeBron offers enough upside to give the other players a rest. If LeBron only played with the best lineups, his numbers would be better. You can say LeBron no longer “elevates” his teammates or makes up for a bad roster like he used to, but at the end of the day looking at a guy comparing these numbers for a guy who takes the court with Christian Koloko and Shake Milton is going to have worse numbers by default than say, a guy who is on a team like the Knicks who keep their rotations much tighter. || And he just had another 40 point game after this last night lmao. If anything he’s somehow better than his age 39 season? || I'm late to this discussion but there is another layer to this.   On pbpstats Lebron's 3 point shooting luck when on and off the court is quite unlucky.  When Lebron is on the court, his teammates even on open possessions have forgotten how to shoot.  On the court, they go nuclear from 3.  Swings like this happen all time.  SGA's season is getting juiced even more than it should be by 3 point shooting luck when he is on and off the court in the reverse direction.  Lebron has benefitted from these swings at various times in his career, but this isn't the first time it has happened, but it is the most dramatic example.  In 2018 he almost had a negative on/off.  EPM and DRtg capture this and make his defense look a lot worse than it actually is in this particular season.  It has started to normalize though. || All this advanced stats go out of the window if you watch games but why do that right, no seriours person will watch the last Lakers game and say that Luka was better than LBJ.

In short advanced stats can be deceiving as well if you are using them to further our own agenda and throw context out of the window.

Lakers started they best run when they went small and AD was out.

But not much is expected of a dude who is a Warriors fan and spends his time on reddit hating on LeBron (in order to prop Curry ) and using kindergarten talking points.

And the most hilarious is trying to mask it as thoughful discussion in this sub.

One other thing that is funny is that since Lebron took a week off he has been balling and pushing his team into the standings. || It's a great analysis by OP. LeBron is slowing down. A lot of turnovers. Passing like crap. Little to no defense. Father Time is undefeated. What happens next is nagging small injuries pile up or a devastating Achilles or knee injury occurs or both. Hopefully they can make one last run. I think most people want to see that. || A well-balanced, reasonable take. *Nods* || Definitely agree with this.

But for a lot of your questions, the team communicates with the players just like your bosses communicate with you.

There's a team of people that handle communications, hotel arrangements, visitor requests, special arrangements. They'll even take your dogs for a few days on a road trip if you've got nobody home to take care of them. || Check out sports business classroom: https://www.sportsbusinessclassroom.com/

Only thing I've seen really geared towards the admin side of things. || I've also been interested in team logistics, equipment managers and travel logistics for all sports, draft war rooms, Olympic team gear hauls, things like that.


There's a channel on YouTube that used to visit a bunch of different team equipment managers. Shoe-wise, I think it depends on relationships between players and shoe companies (ie who sponsors a player). For sponsored players, they may know the kinds of shoes they like and make sure they send those, plus others to test out. Additionally, I think the companies send a bunch of shoes to teams for non sponsored players to pick from. And non sponsored players might be able to make requests, too (I don't know for sure though). At the end of the year, players have a bunch of shoes left over that they have shipped to their homes.


As with everything, it's all pretty logistically organized and streamlined so players don't need to think too much, except for what they have at home to support their job (ie the decision to have a personal chef, in-home gym, etc). Once they make decisions, there are many resources available from the team, the league, and good agents, to help them get things done.


Players and staff also have group chats which fills several purposes, but specifically when it comes to logistics, helps them organize get togethers (ie on Old Man and the Three, they had Jaren Jackson and Desmond Bane on, and they were asked a question about Steven Adams, and one of the stories was of a get together at assistant coach's house Darko (now HC at Toronto) where his gf cooked up a meal for Adams before the get together where he had several more chicken breasts. That's the sort of stuff that group chats would facilitate.


What was most interesting to me when I was first interested in team logistics, was all the stuff players travel with on the road. It isn't just what the social media shows with one carryon and a backpack. They carry PS4s; personal massage kits and cryo kits for their legs or arms or whatever, even torsos; podcasting gear; all sorts of stuff to make their lives easier and more comfortable on the road.


Equipment staff usually takes care of a ton of things and have to do so at the visiting arena a certain fixed time before the team arrives, so often they go straight to the arena upon landing, and there is a logistics side there to how many copies of different jerseys and equipment to bring depending on how long the trip is, I think including sewing (or maybe the home team lets them use their sewing as a reciprocated courtesy), in case of a new player that arrives midway during a road trip. They have to be prepared for every. Thing. And that brings up reciprocated services and hospitality by all home teams, where they let visiting teams, and players away from their teams, use their weight rooms, and I know the team I root for lets other players come by just whenever (within reason), especially if someone is rehabbing but coming through town for whatever reason, and wants to use the training facilities, the team tries to accommodate them. Probably not medical staff, but just like the ice tubs after a weight room or shooting round. And I suspect that is not uncommon. Just need to communicate with the team ahead of time. || Recommended videos/channels to learn more about the logistics would be Royal Key/Coiski Media they have a lot of vlogs on touring the facilities with operation and equipment managers of professional sports and college teams. They also have vlogs on nutrition/wellness executives on how they prepare food for teams especially for college teams. Some NBA team vlogs have specific videos on Game Day prep with the equipment operations teams from ingress and egress of games and this shows how spoiled NBA teams are where these dudes behind the scenes barely sleep especially on those back-to-backs and late flights. There are also vlogs on team security staff of the Milwaukee Bucks making sure that things don't escalate on-court and coordinating with the logistics/operations teams on team security when moving in and out of cities.

Most of the equipment operation guys started out as ball-boys and eventually move up or were Assistants and the job is taxing one, given how big egos are in a pro sports team. They would need to know literally hundreds of items from socks, shirts, compression (pants, sleeves, tops, shirts, hybrids where one sleeve is longer), braces, shorts, multiple-colored jerseys, headbands, practice shirts, shorts, pants, tank tops, and A LOT of SHOES). 

When the NBA changed their rules of allowing teams/players to wear shoes that are not limited to primarily being their team's colorways, this also added another dynamic layer of logistics for them since they would need to consider the number of pairs each player has. Adding to the issue would be teams with multiple signature athletes, coordinating with their brands for specific colorways/releases ex. Christmas Day, MLK day, All-Star, Playoffs and etc. Normally a lot of players who aren't necessarily signed to a brand ex. Nike can easily request through the equipment team for specific customizations if they have bigger sizes beyond 16 or 17 or they would most likely have brand reps who would offer teams discounts on shoes/colorways that were mostly evident prior to the NBA attire/fashion rule change where shoes like Hyperdunks would be in team colors. 

They would also need to have multiple back-ups, of each item, and they must prepare and collect dirty gear and get them clean while the team is travelling, and this requires a lot of coordination with the other team's opponent if they are in the road and they assist each other with laundry and getting their gear in place in the arena or even practice facilities.

For team operations outside of the equipment, they definitely have internal team roles who handle the back-office/internal activities that a team does. It could range from sales/marketing, analytics, operations (including equipment managers), HR, administrative, finance and accounting, PR, communications which you would normally see in a typical corporate office and these roles are mostly non-basketball related. 

Hope this helps since I'm also a big fan of the NBA beyond the basketball aspects! || I was a security guard a few years ago for MLSE and Masai Ujiri would often leave his office door open so I would have to go in and close it but he had business cards with a common email on it, pictures of his family on his desk and a parking space with his name. Downstairs of his office is the leafs office, and around draft time they had a war room with players they wanted just written on a white board and after the draft they used the war room to discuss free agents they wanted to sign and what they expected them to get and what they were willing to pay for the free agents. It's pretty common that it runs just like a regular office. Fridges, lunch rooms, merch. But the raptors don't really have their own parking lot, they have Biometrics to get into locker rooms and practice court on the top floor of the Scotiabank arena. If the player doesn't have their ID card, then they have to go through a different entrance. I remember being at a door on an off day and 3 raptors walked in and very very politely asked if they can go to the gym upstairs and work out. I didn't recognise them because they weren't starters or anything n were in street clothes and I was like ""naw that's just for players"", and they told me their names and the guard I was with said ""y'all play for the raptors?"" And they laughed and politely said yeah we play for the raptors. Looked at their ID and called it in and they got an escort upstairs. Their locker rooms are pretty small to be fair, leafs one is cool but basic for it being a billion dollar franchise. Media room is just an open space with a drinks fridge and food set out.

And also, this has nothing to do with anything but when I worked there it was 2 or 3 years after the championship and there was NOT A SINGLE picture of kawhi Leonard in the entire arena. Pictures of the parade, no Kawhi, draft picks, no Kawhi, random players, no Kawhi. And they meet every year and discuss the pictures in the arena so it's a conscious decision to not put Kawhi in the building. || I was curious about logistics around a player being traded and found this interesting article ok group chats in the NBA

Not really you’re question but still may intrigue you. || yeah I've always wondered how they specifically get paid. Are dudes just getting like 1 million direct deposited every two weeks?

Sure it’s MLB but he has a podcast and he often goes on other pods like Lebatard Show to discuss the ins and outs of running a sports team. From how people learn they are traded and report to their new team, to how a team gets an arena approved and funded. It’s called Nothing Personal. || I love this question because I'm fascinated by it as well. In fact, during my (failed) degree in International Business Studies I worked out a case-study with a local football (soccer) club. This was the early 2000s in the Netherlands, but it is so much more complex than you'd imagine.

For example in football, the team manager is not the 'coach' (the man they call manager in football), it's a dedicated role and they are often supported by an assistant. Their role is to plan all logistics. Getting a football team with 30 people from one city to the other in the Netherlands is relatively easy, you hop on a bus and drive. But you also need all the kit, all the documentation, the hotel sorting, the fitness suite sorting, physio rooms etc. etc. They had check-lists for everything and these were constantly changed to meet emerging requirements, like a player needing sports tape or changing dietary requirements.

Between clubs, things are arranged with 'riders' like music acts and actors do as well, the hosting club describes what facilities will be available to the visiting team. But it's on a 'like for like' basis. If the team you are visiting is only providing you with bare necessities... well, then you only provide them with that when they return, right? There's a lot of unspoken rules and gentleman's agreements involved. 

Hotels tend to be booked as soon as the schedule is known and each club has good contacts with particular hotels/chains. Back then the team I studied had an agreement with Van der Valk hotels, a big chain in the Netherlands. They had just got quite far into the cup and were playing a team at the other side of the country, but all hotels were fully booked due to another major event in the area. So Van der Valk arranged a bunch of caravans on a nearby camping for the team to stay in. Apparently it wasn't very comfortable because they lost that game 3-1.

Training/exercise is run by the coaches/actual manager. But again, not in the way you'd necessarily expect. Every month they decide on the 'agenda' in a big meeting with the captain of the team, the physios/sports scientists. But I learned that it is different for each manager. Some prefer lots of team focussed training and a lot of team-wide stamina/cardio training, others draw up seperate schedules for sections of the team (defenders, attackers, midfielders etc.) and adapted for each player's individual needs. It is super intricate and I can only imagine that in the last 20 years that has only become more complicated. Add in that in the NBA the players have a huge say, many have their own personal trainers/chefs etc. So I think it's probably quite different in the NBA in that sense. 

Oh, before I forget, discipline was a huge eye-opener for me as well. The team agree fines at the start of the season, being late, swearing, smoking and drinking (a player told me a brilliant anecdote of being out in the city after a big win with a couple of others, they were drinking and pretty drunk on the main square, partying with fans, when the manager and assistant coach spotted them. Big no no! Cost them €1300 each, which was a week's wages at the time! Funniest thing: The manager was completely blottoed himself) but it's actually the team-captain that is in charge of that. He collects the money and depending on how much there is at the end of the season either organises a massive party, donates to a charity of his choice or a combination of the two. || That's a very interesting topic for me. Like, does LeBron have a company phone? Does he need to go through mandatory courses so he doesn't click on a phishing email and get hacked? || So LeBron exchanges emails, text messages, phone calls, Teams messages, in-person meetings, virtual meetings, and hand written post it notes with JJ. || I’d love to see the spreadsheets equipment managers have to track the extra gear each player wears. Arm bands. Wrist bands. Headbands. Shooting sleeves. Leggings. One-leg leggings. Knee pads. Mouth guards. The list goes on and on. || This is super helpful. I’ll check out those videos. Thanks. || That was interesting. It’s funny to read an article from 2019 that talks about group chats like they are some great advancement in technology. My favorite was the mention of players forming group chats to discuss teaming up in free agency with the implication it’s scandalous. || They only get paid during the season so it’s their annual salary divided by the number of payments in a season. But yes, otherwise it’s just a normal payroll. || It would make sense to me have a couple “player relationship” managers that just say “hey plane leaves at 6p lmk if you need a car or you’ll be driving, trip is 8 days”

When I get tickets to go watch games, my wife's cousin texts the fan relations person directly.

The cool thing is that they also have an internal bidding system for tickets for anyone associated and working with the league. So say you want to catch the Bulls vs Hornets in Chicago.

Thanks to LeBron's evolution from his heliocentric role into a 0.5 battering ram.,"The morning I filled in for Adam Mares on the All-NBA podcast with Tim Legler, I watched Los Angeles lose to Charlotte. As I took notes and pulled clips, I could only feel disbelief at how clunky the Los Angeles offense looked with two players trying to play the same role: heliocentric alpha.

LeBron James and Luka Doncic have thrived in this role throughout their NBA careers. They’re the basketball version of grandmasters chess players. They’ve seen every coverage under the sun, can make every shot/read in the book, and they both know how to move the pieces around the basketball chessboard with precision and ease.

Thanks for reading Low Man Help! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.

But like [Highlander, there can be only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcLjcSloXs), and as to the question of who would be that *one* for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

Players often say they want to win, but they really mean, “I want to win, but I want to do it playing my way.”

The Charlotte game felt like a line of demarcation for this team. Two heliocentric grandmaster chess players wouldn’t give them the best chance to win, so an evolution had to happen.

**Two BIG things have stood out to me since that Charlotte game:**

1. LeBron’s shift into a 0.5 Player
2. The Roberson Rule

**LeBron’s Final Act:**

LeBron James has shifted from the only role he’s ever known in the NBA into a 0.5 player[1](#footnote-1). This is a massive step for someone of his caliber; he’s undoubtedly one of the top players to play this game.

Since the clunky Charlotte game, Los Angeles has won four games in a row, three of which have featured both James and Doncic. In those three victories, James recorded his two lowest games of the season in average touch length and average dribbles per touch.

During the Los Angeles win over Denver, James set a season low for average touch length (2.892 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.83).

The Denver game was the only time during the 24/25 that he had been under three seconds per touch or two dribbles. Until the Los Angeles win over Minnesota, James again set a season low for average touch length (2.581 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.44).

The data indicates precisely what the eye test says: LeBron has shifted into the 0.5 player this team needed to reach its ceiling, and he and the Los Angeles Lakers are thriving!

**LeBron James Closeouts:**

* Before Luka: 1.033 Points Per Chance (52nd Percentile)
* After Luka: 1.351 Points Per Chance (87th Percentile)

One of the most significant benefits of James relinquishing the highlander role to Doncic has been seeing his first three steps transition from then defensive end to offense. James no longer waits for every outlet pass to control the chess board; he knows Doncic sees the same picture he does, so he gets on his horse and goes!

James has long been one of the league's best, if not its best athlete. However, creating offense in the NBA takes energy, and that burden fell on James more times than not. But with Doncic in Los Angeles, the on-ball burden is gone, and LeBron’s athleticism has been unleashed every play they’re on the court together.

**The Roberson Rule:**

JJ Reddick is using the NBA regular season as a defensive lab experiment. One theory he’s been beta testing is [Seth Partnow’s “Roberson Rule.”](https://x.com/SethPartnow)

The past week, Aaron Gordon, Russell Westbrook, Dante Exum, Naji Marshall, Jaden McDaniels, Jaylen Clark, and Tarrence Shannon Jr. have received Reddick's version of Partnow's Roberson Rule.

One of the things I always tell agents, scouts, or front office members when discussing shooting is that volume matters. Yes, it’s great to be a 40% shooter from the three-point line, but if the player turns down open → semi-open shots to pass or drive into traffic, the percentage doesn’t matter because they can be put into a box defensively.

The Roberson Rule is that box.

Since January 15th, Los Angeles has been first in defensive rating, opponents’ points in the paint, and opponents’ FG%. The results are straightforward; the lab experiment is working.

Reddick is unwilling to concede gravity to players he doesn’t believe will shoot enough volume to beat them. Instead, he chooses to shrink the defensive shell and shift more gravity to players who *can* beat Los Angeles, like Jokic, Kyrie, and Anthony Edwards.

# Ben Taylor showed what that extra gravity looks like when shifted towards a player (Jokic).

Even a few makes from Gordon and Westbrook didn’t shake his resolve in the Roberson Rule strategy; it takes volume. Your shooting gravity is not defined by your percentage but by a combination of three factors: Percentage, Volume, and Mechanics.

He knows that players who have never shot 15 threes in an NBA game don’t know how to deal with the emotional swings of missing nine threes and it still being a good thing for the team, and he’s betting on players not being able to step that far outside the Overton Window of volume.The Luka Lakers Are Figuring It Out...",1460,107,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j0hguj/the_luka_lakers_are_figuring_it_out_thanks_to/,2025-02-28 15:29:35,"Great article!

Then of course Lebron can rim run and is one of the best in transition which is easy money for a full court passing threat like Luka

He’s always given other guys the opportunity to create, he’s always been a good cutter, he’s always utilized some post ups if the guard doesn’t have many options, etc 

Ball dominant? Yes

Heliocentric? No || > But like Highlander, there can be only one, and as to the question of who would be that one for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

I kind of disagree with this framing, as if LeBron playing off ball is the result of Luka being the better player, which he hasn't been in LA so far. LeBron even ceded ball handling duties to Westbrook to become a screen and short roll player when they were in the lineup together. To me this arrangement is the result of LeBron covering up Luka's weakness as an off ball player in the same way he covered up Anthony Davis' weakness as an on ball player. 

Even at this age, LeBron has less weaknesses than Luka and can do everything well and is an elite play initiator and finisher. Depending on what he has on his team, he can do either. So he's adapting his game to utilize the strengths of his teammate because he can in a way less flexible players cannot. || This isn’t accurate.

Since Luka arrived, LeBron’s touches per game have actually increased from 85.6 to 91.2, along with his scoring, which has jumped from 24.5 to 28.2 points per game.

For context, LeBron’s 91.2 touches per game surpass Luka’s 78.2.

Luka has merely come in to play point guard and distribute the ball to LeBron, but he hasn’t yet been the “alpha” or “Highlander” on the Lakers. LeBron has found a way to maintain that role—despite the devastating impact of 0.74 fewer dribbles per touch (shocking!). || I think Denver can put lineups out there (sans Westbrook) where you won’t feel as comfortable as you did last game. 

I think as teams see this more, they'll try to adjust as best they can. 

Boston can handle this coverage (obviously). Doing this on Golden State is scary because even though Green can't shoot, he's always a threat to get into quick two-man game actions with Curry or Buddy, who you must be up at the level to prevent open shots. || Hard to play this defense against the Bucks. I've seen teams all year focus on taking Dame away but then there is Giannis. As for role players AJ Green will gladly jack up 10+ 3s. To a lesser extent so will GTJ and Lopez.

Please share your thoughts even if it's about a single sentence that I have written. Apologies if this post is an incoherent mess and a long rambly mess. I'm just trying to get my ideas out there. To start off, I do not claim to be objective and I have my own preconceived notions, biases, and prejudices. I could be mistaken in various of my points here and I am open to having a discussion about any of them. Also, I note lots of examples in this post so forgive me if these examples are not 100% exhaustive.

Peruse r/nba or r/nbadiscussion and you will see a variety of narratives, especially about superstar or HOF-bound players or even solid role players:

""LeBron James cannot win without a superstar teammate""

""Kevin Durant cannot win without Steph Curry""

""Russel Westbrook will never win a championship""

""It is impossible for Joel Embiid to get out of the second round""

""X player never won anything""

""Scottie Pippen can't lead a team""

""Allen Iverson single-handedly dragged the 76ers in 2001 to the finals""

""Dirk Nowitzki carried the 2011 Mavericks""

""James Harden cannot win as the #1 option"".

""X player jumps ship and moves teams when it gets tough""

""Chris Paul can't win a ring""

""Jimmy Butler has never won anything""

""The 50s and 60s players played against plumbers and milkmen""

""Jordan went 1-9 in playoff series without Scottie Pippen""

""Kevin Garnett could only win once he teamed up with other all-stars""

""X player is inefficient/is a ball hog/is a stat padder""

""Rudy Gobert is a bagless big and is overrated""

""X player got swept/convincingly beat in a playoff series, therefore Y""

""X player is greater than Y player because he stayed loyal to Z franchise""

""X player missed the playoffs in his prime, therefore Y""

""X player saved Y player's legacy""

""X player is no better than a scrub role player""

and many, many others...

Admittedly, I too, found some of these narratives convincing. You likely have reservations about one or more of these narratives. It is irrelevant whether or not these narratives are true. Players are devalued and valued based on things they largely have no control over. Regardless of whether you believe these narratives or not, they are ubiquitous in NBA discussions. All of these narratives are dependent on these outcomes decided by near inches or close games: Ron Artest's 2010 Game 7 Finals 3pt shot, Kyrie Irving's Game 7 Finals 2016 3pt shot, Kevin Durant's game-tying shot in Game 7 2021 ECSF, JR Smith's blunder in Game 1 of the 2018 Finals, Kawhi's Game 7 buzzer-beater in the 2019 ECSF, Jason Kidd's infamous momentum killing timeout in last year's 2024 Finals in Game 3, Game 6 Klay in the 2016 WCF, John Paxson's clutch shot in the 1993 Finals, Steve Kerr's clutch shot in the 1997 NBA Finals, 2002 WCF Game 6 Kings vs Lakers, Ray Allen's clutch shot in Game 7 2013, Game 5 1994 Bulls vs Knicks ECSF (Hue Hollins) call away. These are all moments that could have gone either way and should not define a player's legacy (the most overused word in NBA dialect nowadays) or their impact on winning basketball games.

All of these narratives are also dependent on injuries: Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving injuries in 2015, Draymond Green's suspension in 2016, Kevin Durant missing the 2015 playoffs and the entire 2020 season, Westbrook missing the 2013 playoffs after his meniscus tear, Steph Curry missing most of the 2020 season, Chris Paul getting hurt in the 2018 WCF, Kawhi's injury in the 2017 WCF, Klay Thompson tearing his ACL and Achilles, LeBron tearing in groin in 2019 and missing the playoffs, Kevin Garnett getting hurt in 2009, and I could keep going but I won't for brevity.

Some of these narratives depend on the situations of players drafted to not-ideal situations or bad front offices: LeBron was drafted to a mediocre Cleveland team in 2003, Kevin Garnett's time with Minnesota was plagued with misfortunes (like the Joe Smith situation, among others), OKC let go of James Harden and Demarcus Cousins was drafted to the Kings.

I find something wrong with denigrating or valuing players based on injuries they cannot control or outcomes that could have gone either way. Instead, players should be valued based on their individual performances and their impact on winning in a large enough sample size. I don't know what the sample size is so you can decide that. Maybe we need 40 playoff games to determine how well a player performs in the postseason. If so, then we should need around that same amount of regular season games to see how good a player is in general. I find it logical to value postseason performance more than regular season performance and most of us already do this.

You can have players who are individually excellent and impact winning tremendously (Jokic), players who are individually excellent but don't impact winning (Kevin Love in Minnesota), and players who are not individually excellent but impact winning (Draymond Green). Yet, some people value Draymond Green over Kevin Love or vice versa. That is an interesting conversation to have. It's not interesting to simply say ""Draymond has more rings than Kevin Love, therefore he is a better player"" because their circumstances are so different. I once thought like this as well, but I think it is a lazy attempt for our brains to make conclusions on highly variable situations and circumstances between players with completely different teammates, coaches, front office, the era they played in, etc.

As most of us know, individual players' stats do not tell the whole story and are not consistent indicators. Looking at box score numbers to determine a player's impact does not reveal that player's true impact. You could look at Box Plus-Minus, Win Shares, DBPM, Net Rating, PER, DARKO, or whatever other metrics to find the most impactful basketball players. A player's impact should be the only thing that matters when evaluating a player's greatness. We know Jayson Tatum impacts winning, but that does not stop someone from saying ""Oh, but he didn't win Finals MVP"". I think we need to stop this infantile level of discussion. I am guilty of engaging in this type of discussion myself. Whether we should value individual performances over impact on winning depends on the situation and that is a conversation we can have.

When I use ""we"", I am referring to some NBA fans, not all. Intangibles like leadership, mental toughness, and poise under tight situations, play a role in player evaluation, but it is unfair when the NBA community says ""X player is not a leader"" or ""X player is not clutch"" or ""X is soft"" when we are not in the locker room with that player and we cannot possibly have an inkling of knowledge on these intangibles. We use a few clips or quotes to make these conclusions about players without knowing the full story and circumstances behind a player. We use the stats of said player in the clutch as a way to be objective, we say, yet each clutch situation is highly different with varying circumstances. Instead of how players perform in the clutch under relatively similar conditions (we say it's too much work to do this), we just throw out the clutch stats of one player against another to make our conclusion. I must admit I have done this myself when debating with others on this particular topic. These types of conclusions are frankly lazy and we should do better as the NBA community.

We devalue LeBron James for his series against the Mavericks in 2011 and attribute none of that loss to the Mavericks' game planning, we blame Steph Curry for ""choking"" in 2016 and narratives persisted for years that he was not clutch even though that 2016 Warriors team was minutes away from winning the title, we say Jordan was 1-9 in the playoffs without Scottie Pippen as ""proof"" that Jordan is not as great as we say he is, we say that Kobe's legacy was ""saved"" thanks to Ron Artest's shot in Game 7 2010 Finals, we say that Westbrook is a selfish stat padder who will never win a title, among other narratives that try to make simple conclusions for outcomes. As a specific example, we forget that Iverson's 2001 76ers could have faced Vince Carter's Raptors in the ECF instead of the Bucks if Vice Carter hadn't missed that game-winning shot in Game 7 against the Bucks in the semi-finals. We don't know the outcome of a 2001 76ers vs Raptors ECF, but people would not be idolizing Iverson for ""dragging"" that 76ers team to the finals. We see Vince Carter as one of those very good players, HOF worthy, but not ""one of the greats"", when it's very possible he could have led his team to the finals in 2001 which would have given him extra ""legacy"" points. This is just one example out of many of how we elevate and denigrate players based on non-deterministic outcomes determined by mere inches.

The biggest problem is that NBA discussion is based wholly on simplistic narratives instead of actual basketball, which I am aware has already been talked about ad nauseum.  Whether a team wins a championship depends on so many factors including team chemistry, front office decisions, games decided in the last few seconds/minutes, playcalling, competent coaching, etc.

I could be wrong here, but I do not find it convincing that superstar players are the main reason for their team's success. They are the most consistent contributors to a team, but an individual player is almost never responsible for more than 50% of the team's offensive production. We say that Nikola Jokic is carrying the Nuggets this year. As of today's date 02/27/25, Nikola Jokic is averaging 29.2 ppg, 12.6 rpg, 10.4 apg (source: https://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/\_/name/den/denver-nuggets). He's contributing to 29.2 + (10.4 \* 2 < x < 10.4 \* 3) points, somewhere along the lines of 50 ppg for the Nuggets. Yet, the Nuggets score 121.3 ppg. The overall team collectively is contributing more than Nikola Jokic individually even though it may not seem that way when watching the games. The Nuggets have struggled this year, but it's not because of Jokic. This is an oversimplification of this point just for clarity. We expect a superstar's team to win when they have a 30-point triple-double or when they drop 50 points. We expect superstars to ""carry"" their teams to titles when basketball is a team sport. The idea of a ""#1 option"" or ""#2 option"" is another way for us to categorize players in a simple way. Fans, including myself, are obsessed with individual heroics. We blame superstar players when their teams lose. We call these players ""chokers"" when they perform poorly in playoff games. We say these players are not clutch or they are not ""killers"" like Kobe or MJ. If given a large enough sample size of poor performances in playoff games, then it is fair to conclude a player cannot perform consistently well in playoff games where teams are game planning against them (James Harden comes to mind, perceived as a choker, whether or not this is true is irrelevant). Yet, how many times have we seen a player have historic performances, yet still lose? Examples include:

Jordan's Bulls vs Celtics 1986 averaging 43.7/6.3/5.7 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1986-nba-eastern-conference-first-round-bulls-vs-celtics.html),

LeBron's Cavs vs Warriors 2018 averaging 34/8.5/10 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2018-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html),

Curry's Warriors vs Raptors 2019 averaging 30.5/5.2/6 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-finals-warriors-vs-raptors.html),

Durant's Thunder vs Heat Finals averaging 30.6/6/2.2 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2012-nba-finals-heat-vs-thunder.html)

We fail to realize that individual heroics do not always transcend the team's collective performance and they often do not. We shouldn't penalize players for that.

This is why player rankings, GOAT debates, and the aforementioned narratives lead to unfair discussions of certain players. If you've been watching the NBA long enough, you'll find these conversations stale and dull, for good reason. Looking at the most impactful players, basketball strategy, game planning, players and their individual performances is a much more fruitful conversation than only comparing the most accomplished. It's easy to compare the individual accolades between players. It's harder to compare their impact only.

We elevate players for winning MVPs, DPOYs, championships, All-NBA teams, and All-Defense teams when these are highly dependent on the talent in the rest of the league. It is unfair to elevate one player who has an MVP over another player who does not solely based on that accolade. When I compare two players, I ask myself this question: If I swap the individual accolades of the players I am comparing, does that change my perspective of them? Of course, the exception is players who would never win certain accolades in any era (Tony Allen likely never wins an MVP in any era and Isaiah Thomas never wins a defensive accolade in any era for being 5'9). If I swap the accolades of LeBron James and Michael Jordan, does that change your perspective of each player? If I change the circumstances (where they were drafted, front office decisions, teammates they have, etc.) of one player with another, does that have any effect on the careers of said players? The answer to both questions must be yes and it likely is for many readers. That is fundamentally a problem with how we evaluate players. We cannot make conclusions about an individual player's greatness based on their accolades or championships because these are situational and circumstantial. Many players who have won MVP would never have won MVP while playing in the 1990s while Michael Jordan was playing. That's not to undermine their incredible accomplishments, but context is needed especially when comparing and evaluating players.

I think that the only fair way to determine the value of a player is the impact they have on winning basketball games and their individual performances. Winning crucial playoff games and titles is dependent on much more than a superstar player's performance. I do not need to see Luka win a title to know he can be the biggest contributor to a championship team. He's transcendent enough to where I do not need to see him to do that to believe it. I don't need to see Jayson Tatum win an MVP to know he's an incredible basketball player. James Harden's Rockets were 27 missed threes away from advancing to the finals in 2018 yet according to NBA Twitter, he could never win as ""#1 option"" on a team. Yet, individual talent transcends being in varying situations. This is why superstar players who are healthy and in their primes consistently produce and don't average 30 ppg one year and 16 ppg the next despite being surrounded by different teammates, opponents, and coaches. Even being able to perform consistently among those wildly different conditions is praiseworthy (can we stop saying glazing whenever we praise someone?) to me. As such, the only fair criterion for players is their individual performances and how those performances elevate (or don't elevate) their teams. We've seen players be great individually but not consistently elevate their teams.

Because the playoffs have fewer games than the regular season, it is incredibly unfair to judge players solely based on that. Every single player has had bad games in the regular season, yet they cannot have bad performances in the postseason? The outcome of a basketball game is much more complex and has more variables than a superstar player's individual performance.

All that to say we should definitely value players who lead teams titles, especially more so when a player dominates the competition. All of these accomplishments contribute to the GREATNESS of a player, but not whether they are a better player than another player by themselves. Intangibles also matter a ton, but it is tough to evaluate them specifically. I find that when people talk about a player's intangibles, it's all about gut feeling. Please let me know if there is a way to evaluate a player's intangibles fairly. I personally must refrain from talking about intangibles because evaluating a player's intangibles is subject to our preconceived notions, biases, and prejudices, all of which I have. We're not in the locker room with a player, we're not aware of what they say or do in the huddle during a timeout, we don't know what the player says to motivate their teammates before a big playoff game, and we as NBA fans often do not have the knowledge to make conclusions on a player's intangibles. Of course, intangibles matter, but most NBA fans, including myself, do not have the information to evaluate them (even though we think we do). There is a reason many people question the validity of Bill Russel's 11 championships. It's because competition is a factor. There were only 8 teams and 9 Hall of Famers were on that 1960s Celtics team. Despite that, Bill Russel is (and should be) an all-time great but we often say Jordan was better for a multitude of reasons. The only thing that should matter is whether a player performs well and whether their performance elevates their team.

I just wish we were in a world where NBA fans could discuss basketball in its purest form instead of endless, unfounded narratives and dull debates about ""Who's the GOAT?"", ""Can X player be the #1 option on a championship team?"", ""Does X player have that dog or killer instinct in him?"", ""I need X player to drop a 40-point triple-double to win this game"", ""X player cannot carry a team"", ""X player will never win a ring because Y"", ""X player flat-out choked"", etc. Why can't we talk about a team's game plan against a superstar player to slow them down, why can't we talk about or argue how a player's individual greatness either elevates or denigrates their team's overall performance? Why can't we talk about role players without demolishing them for not being the biggest contributors on their teams? Why can't the NBA talk about actual basketball strategy? Talking heads like Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith who know very little about actual basketball strategy behind it have perpetuated these narratives for decades and it has seeped into NBA fan discourse.

TL;DR: I believe that when comparing and evaluating NBA players, we should only look at their individual performances, impact on winning, intangibles, and pure basketball strategy (game planning, defensive schemes, offensive schemes). Not winning titles or accolades only. A particular individual winning an individual accolade (MVP, Finals MVP, All-NBA, All-Defensive, All-Star) does not by itself make one player better than another. This is because these awards are based completely on the competition and the era you play in. A player winning a championship does not by itself make one player better than another. Most of us who have followed the NBA for a while already know this. This is because there are incredibly varying circumstances, injuries, and outcomes that affect winning titles or accolades.

If I could summarize my argument in one sentence, it would be this: Narratives that do not relate to individual performances, impact on winning (there is a difference between the impact on winning and winning), intangibles (I only trust evaluations of this from players, coaches, front office members, or other insiders of an NBA org), or basketball strategy are lazy and unfair attempts to evaluate players.

Again, I could be mistaken on all of this so please let me know what you think. I am open to being corrected about anything here.

  
EDIT: Thanks to DrizzyDayZD. I made a mistake when talking about the series between the Bucks and the Raptors. The Raptors faced off against 76ers in the ECSF in 2001, not the Bucks.

>intangibles (I only trust evaluations of this from players, coaches, front office members, or other insiders of an NBA org

> I do not find it convincing that superstar players are the main reason for their team's success. They are the most consistent contributors to a team, but an individual player is almost never responsible for more than 50% of the team's offensive production.

He's contributing to 29.2 + (10.4 * 2 < x < 10.4 * 3) points, somewhere along the lines of 50 ppg for the Nuggets. Yet, the Nuggets score 121.3 ppg. The overall team collectively is contributing more than Nikola Jokic individually even though it may not seem that way when watching the games. 

This is straightforwardly wrong according to the same advanced stats that you advocate for above. [Nikola Jokic has contributed 7.6 of Denver's 10.9 VORP this year](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DEN/2025.html). A team with Jokic and 11 veteran-minimum players would almost certainly be better than the Nuggets minus Jokic.

Does Tatum have the same impact on winning if he got drafted to the wizards instead of the Celtics. Does Jokic put up the same performances if Luka is on his team.

For those who prefer a quick summary, I used AI to condense it:

NBA player evaluations often rely on oversimplified narratives, championships, and awards, overlooking basketball's team-oriented nature. Players should be assessed based on their individual performance, impact on winning, and strategic contributions, rather than just titles, clutch moments, or vague intangibles like ""killer instinct."" Factors like injuries, luck, and team dynamics are often beyond a player's control, so discussions should focus on deeper basketball analysis instead of reductive debates.

The same thing is happening in everyday speech. We all know how often people say “literally” these days. I don’t know if it’s because people are subconsciously becoming desensitized to descriptive language, but hyperbole seems to be on the rise. “X must be protected at all costs” “I’m literally dead” “James Harden is literally hitler”



Obviously these are meme phrases, but this kind of language exists all over the place, not just in sports. You are definitely picking up on this phenomenon where powerful language is more popular than rational discussion. Is this new to our digital age? Have people always had over-the-top arguments with each other? It’s probably a little of both. Whatever it is it’s everywhere and it certainly hasn’t spared the NBA. || Its simple... I actually think its all about a paycheck - money. Past players are so jealous of money of todays players is making.  That’s why they diss current players so much because retired players didnt make a lot. || [removed] || [removed] || [removed] || This is kind of tangential to your point, but I think the way the Celtics fleeced the Nets in 2013 in the Pierce & KG trade belongs right up there with the rest of your examples. People talk about the trade when they're ranking GMs, what was the worst trade ever, blah blah blah, and it's absolutely interesting in those conversations! But to your point, the trade is not ""pure basketball,"" yet it had (and still has) an enormous impact on the accolades that people like to use to evaluate players. 

The Celtics got to fast forward through rebuilding. Tatum and Brown joined a winning franchise, and got meaningful playoff experience from year 1. I'm a Celtics fan and I think Tatum is incredible, but when people bring up how high his playoff points are for his age, it's impossible to ignore that he was a #3 pick (and would have gone #1) who joined a team that won 53 games and made the ECF the year before he was drafted! That's not a knock against him, it's just a reminder that players exist in a broader context that has nothing to do with their basketball skills.

Anyway, all that is to say rings and stats and wins and losses all have a lot more going into them than what happens on the court, and any narrative which ignores that is at best misleading. || [removed] || I hear u, man. 

The problem is, imo, there is no sport where the players are judged, by media fans and former players, quite like basketball.

LeBron James,"""Lebron James"" OR ""King James"" OR ""Bron"" OR ""Lebron"" OR ""Bron Bron"" OR ""LBJ""",2025-02-27,nbadiscussion,1izbmex,Lebron dominated a weak Eastern Conference myth,"Let’s look at the numbers. From being drafted to leaving for LA, in the regular season Lebron averaged 27/7.5/7 on 50/36/72 against the West and 27/7/7 on 50/33.5/74 against the East. Does a 2% drop in free throws mean he couldn’t cope with the almighty teams in the West and could only play against the plumbers in the East. Even if we take the best team in the West from that entire period in the Spurs in case Lebron was feasting on the Clippers this entire time, he still put up 26.5/7/7 on 50/33/69. A bigger drop in free throws but overall pretty much the same.

Let’s say we don’t care about the regular season because the real problem is that in the playoffs the path through the East was easier so getting to the finals is guaranteed. Playoff averages against the guaranteed East of 29/9/7 on 50/33/74 and playoff averages against the West i.e 50 odd Finals games against teams that won the West of 28/10/8 on 47/34/74. Going from the hopeless East to the best team in the West any given year, the drop off is 1 point and 3% FG efficiency which isn’t nothing but pales in comparison to the narrative.

Let’s say we only care about the years he made it to the finals and specifically the 8 straight appearances. While in Miami, regular season averages against the East of 27/7.5/6.5 on 54/35.5/77 and against the West of 27/7.5/7 on 54.5/39/73. Something about Pacific time just made LeBron a much better 3 point shooter. 2nd stint in Cleveland averages East vs West are practically identical of 26/8/8 on 50/35/70.

None of this means the East wasn’t weak relative to the West but what it does mean is to the extent Lebron dominated the weak East, he equally dominated the strong West, performing just as well if not better against the best team in the West than he did compared to the East at all stages of his career pre-LA.

LeBron wasn't stopable, he was going to get his stats no matter what teams did. 

But the West terms were stronger teams. They didn't slow LeBron down, but as a team they could beat LeBron teams more than in the East because of the other guys on both teams. 

I think the East went through a bit of a down patch, but then LeBron teams became so unstoppable that most players seem to go West. It then kind of because a East is weak because of LeBron situation. || I remember when there were talks about East teams not willing to commit to big changes because LeBron was roaming. A time were the best strategy for East teams was to try to go the long game so they were strong when LeBron started to decline (lol), not during his prime.

He was awesome and he absolutely would’ve had an awesome career in the west, but there’s no way he would’ve been able to go 8 straight years to the finals if he had to play the gauntlet that was the west.

The east had a couple good teams in his time, but it was maybe at its strongest when it was Detroit, Boston, and Cleveland , and maybe to some degree Chicago that were competitive. That’s 3 teams that were good in one postseason. Many of the years there was maybe one team from the East at most that could’ve one a series in the west, let alone against Bron. Had he played in the west every year he would’ve had Lakers, Spurs, Mavs, OKC, Houston, Golden State, Clippers, for a brief moment the Suns, Blazers, and even Utah. All of these teams were at a level where they could’ve knocked off a LeBron led team.

But, its not inconceivable that he would have won more titles if he was drafted by a team in the West, since many of them are quite well run.

But again, 2 of those alone are to the KD warriors, and 1 to the Spurs Dynasty etc. but still, they may be the 2nd best team in the NBA regardless these years, except years like 2018 where both the Rockets are Warriors were both clearly better teams overall

It would be unfortunate of course, but likely still the same amount of rings regardless || Right, the OP doesn't even address the issue. That in those years he lost to some West team in the Finals, if he had been in the West he would have lost those series in the 2nd round or WCF instead. || The “east is weak because of Lebron” idea has never really made sense to me - the West was always (fairly significantly) better.

The forced narrative that the east didn't ""want"" to take swings or that stars went west becuase Lebron was in the east doesn't bear out in any capacity. They were just bad at drafting/constructing.

Because that ended up being the WCF in 2018 and I can't see the 2018 Cavs having a higher seed in the West.

Thanks to LeBron's evolution from his heliocentric role into a 0.5 battering ram.,"The morning I filled in for Adam Mares on the All-NBA podcast with Tim Legler, I watched Los Angeles lose to Charlotte. As I took notes and pulled clips, I could only feel disbelief at how clunky the Los Angeles offense looked with two players trying to play the same role: heliocentric alpha.

LeBron James and Luka Doncic have thrived in this role throughout their NBA careers. They’re the basketball version of grandmasters chess players. They’ve seen every coverage under the sun, can make every shot/read in the book, and they both know how to move the pieces around the basketball chessboard with precision and ease.

Thanks for reading Low Man Help! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.

But like [Highlander, there can be only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcLjcSloXs), and as to the question of who would be that *one* for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

Players often say they want to win, but they really mean, “I want to win, but I want to do it playing my way.”

The Charlotte game felt like a line of demarcation for this team. Two heliocentric grandmaster chess players wouldn’t give them the best chance to win, so an evolution had to happen.

**Two BIG things have stood out to me since that Charlotte game:**

1. LeBron’s shift into a 0.5 Player
2. The Roberson Rule

**LeBron’s Final Act:**

LeBron James has shifted from the only role he’s ever known in the NBA into a 0.5 player[1](#footnote-1). This is a massive step for someone of his caliber; he’s undoubtedly one of the top players to play this game.

Since the clunky Charlotte game, Los Angeles has won four games in a row, three of which have featured both James and Doncic. In those three victories, James recorded his two lowest games of the season in average touch length and average dribbles per touch.

During the Los Angeles win over Denver, James set a season low for average touch length (2.892 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.83).

The Denver game was the only time during the 24/25 that he had been under three seconds per touch or two dribbles. Until the Los Angeles win over Minnesota, James again set a season low for average touch length (2.581 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.44).

The data indicates precisely what the eye test says: LeBron has shifted into the 0.5 player this team needed to reach its ceiling, and he and the Los Angeles Lakers are thriving!

**LeBron James Closeouts:**

* Before Luka: 1.033 Points Per Chance (52nd Percentile)
* After Luka: 1.351 Points Per Chance (87th Percentile)

One of the most significant benefits of James relinquishing the highlander role to Doncic has been seeing his first three steps transition from then defensive end to offense. James no longer waits for every outlet pass to control the chess board; he knows Doncic sees the same picture he does, so he gets on his horse and goes!

James has long been one of the league's best, if not its best athlete. However, creating offense in the NBA takes energy, and that burden fell on James more times than not. But with Doncic in Los Angeles, the on-ball burden is gone, and LeBron’s athleticism has been unleashed every play they’re on the court together.

**The Roberson Rule:**

JJ Reddick is using the NBA regular season as a defensive lab experiment. One theory he’s been beta testing is [Seth Partnow’s “Roberson Rule.”](https://x.com/SethPartnow)

The past week, Aaron Gordon, Russell Westbrook, Dante Exum, Naji Marshall, Jaden McDaniels, Jaylen Clark, and Tarrence Shannon Jr. have received Reddick's version of Partnow's Roberson Rule.

One of the things I always tell agents, scouts, or front office members when discussing shooting is that volume matters. Yes, it’s great to be a 40% shooter from the three-point line, but if the player turns down open → semi-open shots to pass or drive into traffic, the percentage doesn’t matter because they can be put into a box defensively.

The Roberson Rule is that box.

Since January 15th, Los Angeles has been first in defensive rating, opponents’ points in the paint, and opponents’ FG%. The results are straightforward; the lab experiment is working.

Reddick is unwilling to concede gravity to players he doesn’t believe will shoot enough volume to beat them. Instead, he chooses to shrink the defensive shell and shift more gravity to players who *can* beat Los Angeles, like Jokic, Kyrie, and Anthony Edwards.

# Ben Taylor showed what that extra gravity looks like when shifted towards a player (Jokic).

Even a few makes from Gordon and Westbrook didn’t shake his resolve in the Roberson Rule strategy; it takes volume. Your shooting gravity is not defined by your percentage but by a combination of three factors: Percentage, Volume, and Mechanics.

He knows that players who have never shot 15 threes in an NBA game don’t know how to deal with the emotional swings of missing nine threes and it still being a good thing for the team, and he’s betting on players not being able to step that far outside the Overton Window of volume.The Luka Lakers Are Figuring It Out...",1461,107,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j0hguj/the_luka_lakers_are_figuring_it_out_thanks_to/,2025-02-28 15:29:35,"Great article!

Then of course Lebron can rim run and is one of the best in transition which is easy money for a full court passing threat like Luka

People are mentioning Luka’s shooting slump, which is normal after an injury, but when you realize how often he’s double teamed and blitzed that’s what creates shot quality for other guys || LeBron’s never actually been heliocentric. We’ve gotten too liberal with the word. He’s always given other guys the opportunity to create, he’s always been a good cutter, he’s always utilized some post ups if the guard doesn’t have many options, etc 

Ball dominant? Yes

Heliocentric? No || > But like Highlander, there can be only one, and as to the question of who would be that one for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

I kind of disagree with this framing, as if LeBron playing off ball is the result of Luka being the better player, which he hasn't been in LA so far. LeBron even ceded ball handling duties to Westbrook to become a screen and short roll player when they were in the lineup together. To me this arrangement is the result of LeBron covering up Luka's weakness as an off ball player in the same way he covered up Anthony Davis' weakness as an on ball player. 

Even at this age, LeBron has less weaknesses than Luka and can do everything well and is an elite play initiator and finisher. Depending on what he has on his team, he can do either. So he's adapting his game to utilize the strengths of his teammate because he can in a way less flexible players cannot. || This isn’t accurate.

Since Luka arrived, LeBron’s touches per game have actually increased from 85.6 to 91.2, along with his scoring, which has jumped from 24.5 to 28.2 points per game.

For context, LeBron’s 91.2 touches per game surpass Luka’s 78.2.

Luka has merely come in to play point guard and distribute the ball to LeBron, but he hasn’t yet been the “alpha” or “Highlander” on the Lakers. LeBron has found a way to maintain that role—despite the devastating impact of 0.74 fewer dribbles per touch (shocking!). || I think Denver can put lineups out there (sans Westbrook) where you won’t feel as comfortable as you did last game. 

I think as teams see this more, they'll try to adjust as best they can. 

Boston can handle this coverage (obviously). Doing this on Golden State is scary because even though Green can't shoot, he's always a threat to get into quick two-man game actions with Curry or Buddy, who you must be up at the level to prevent open shots. || Hard to play this defense against the Bucks.

This season, LeBron James is averaging 25 ppg and has only missed 5 games out of a possible 59. However, his scoring has shown a clear upwards trajectory over the past month, so assuming he will average 27 points, playing 20 out of the Lakers' possible 23 games, LeBron James will end this season with 42377 points. 

We know LeBron will play in 2025-26. Let's assume he stays at 26 ppg for that year, playing around 73 games. This is around the same as last yr, and with a primary playmaker, we can assume a similar volume. At the end of the 2025-26 season, LeBron will have 44275 points. 

Now we enter speculation zone. However, I think it's probable that LeBron would sign at least 1 more two year contract, especially if the Lakers are contending, which is seeming likely. 

In 2026-27, LeBron would become 42, which means we should expect some dropoff.... but should we? I personally believe LeBron will lose some step by this time, but not so much that he would be scoring less than 24 ppg. Assuming he misses around 9 games again, this brings LeBron James to 46027 points. 

At this point, we see the vision. If LeBron James decides to chase the 50k mark, he can play 3 more seasons playing only 60 games a season, and average 23 for that to get there.

If he's still averaging 25 for 70 games in 2028, he'd be at 47777 at the end of his contract, which means he'd only need to average 16 a game for two more seasons playing 70 games. If he only plays 60 games, for those last years, he'd only need to average 19.

I hope that he plays forever and puts every longevity stat completely out of reach, but I just don’t see him playing beyond 2028 and even that might be a stretch. || Yeah I think if he wants to keep playing, 50k is within reach.

I could see him sign another year with a player option, maybe 2 with a player option beyond that if the Lakers are contending and he’s still contributing at an all-star level. 

But as soon as he stops being seen as one of the best in the league, I think he’s done. Yes, he could in theory get to 50k points, but there’s a lot of things in basketball he COULD do, that there comes a point where continuing to set goals is near impossible. Because what’s next? 55k? 60k? Hell, if he’s still an elite player at age 46, does he want to be the first NBA player to be 50 years old and still in the league?

The money to be paid would go to an up and coming guy or some bench pieces that would make the team well rounded instead of the current pieces they have. || At this point, he doesn’t want to keep playing in the league to just hit a 50k mark. It is physically and emotionally taxing to have to doing the offseason workouts, the ramping up, the early morning shoot around and the traveling. He probably wants to retire and have his family life and other career (movie, shoes, endorsements) take off. For me as a basketball fan, I would like to see LeBron keep pushing the limits of his age and defy aging and keep up his insane consistency. But I totally understand his perspective. || If Luka takes over I wonder if there’s a world where LeBron does go after it and maybe transitions to a bench guy in a few years.

After reading the comments though, it's giving me flashbacks to a thread from maybe 10 years ago that was basically saying that Lebron could realistically break Kareems record. All of these comments are saying the same exact things they were saying back then lol. || Legit question - if he slowed down (say from father time or injury) a tick or two, wouldn't his strength, frame, and skill set still make a great center for 20 minutes a game? || Lebron scored 6,007 points in his first 3 seasons, through his age 21 season. Kareem was in college then. I think lebron will want to eclipse kareem by at least that number of points to ward off any argument that his record has an asterisk, because he got the benefit of three extra years in the league while kareem was dominating college. So i think he’ll want at least 45k || I’m guessing he goes for 45,000 then calls it a day.  No ones  catching that number. || yeah that’s super easy. So we just count his playoff points. bada bung bada boom. || I think it’s possible.

He’s already 40. Would his body really decline that much more by the time he’s 43-44? Probably not (barring any significant injuries). I think it comes down to motivation, and the Lakers will be contenders for at least the next 2 seasons. That’ll get him to 45k. From there, it’s all about how much he wants it.

One thing we should all know about LeBron is that he’s very petty - he would want nobody else to break his ATS record ever, and if he hits 50k it would surely cement that. || It's definitely possible. Currently he puts up at least 1500 pts a year during the regular season. As long as he shows no signs of slowing down, and maintains scoring 1500 pts a season, he can absolutely get it done in 6 years || technically possible but it won't happen. He's stated repeatedly his plan to retire in the near future (my guess is after 2028) and as he ages into his mid 40s the injuries will become more common || Is there a max age limit? Could bron be 60 and still play as long as there’s someone signing him? || It’s possible but he’s just not gonna wanna do it.  I’m pretty confident in saying that he’d still be a decent player at 45, I just don’t know why he’d wanna do that || I think it’s gonna be after the ‘28 season and the Olympics but it’s gonna come down to that Las Vegas expansion team really. Luka and his sons give him incentive to keep playing but I see 2-3 seasons after this, whenever they give him that team. || His longevity is truly unprecedented, so nobody can really say it's impossible because there's no reference to make predictions based on. That said, I think it's highly unlikely. || Possible, yes. Likely, no. 

He’s said on numerous occasions that he’s done everything he set out to. He has absolutely no reason to want to chase 50k reg season points. I’ll go out on a limb and say we’ll all be dead and gone before another generational athlete comes along and surpasses what he’s done.

Yes, LeBron is 40 years old, but he's not just coasting – he's putting up a season worthy of MVP consideration, and here's why:

**LeBron is defying Father Time (again!):** Over his last 30 games, he's averaging 26.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 8.2 assists per game. Those are elite numbers for any player, let alone someone with two decades of mileage. He's also shooting efficiently, at 54.7% from the field and 43% from three. And get this: since Luka Dončić joined the Lakers, he's been even better, averaging 28 points and 10.1 rebounds per game!

**Elevating a Flawed Roster:** Let's be real, the Lakers supporting cast was considered weak before Luka arrived. Even now, many consider the team poorly constructed. Despite this, LeBron has kept them competitive in the loaded West. He's the leader of this team, guiding them through inconsistencies and making his teammates better.

**The Three-Way Race (Last 30 Games):**

Here's how LeBron stacks up against the other frontrunners over their last 30 games:

* **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander:** SGA is having an incredible season, leading the league in scoring. Over his last 30, he's averaging 34.7 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 6.5 assists. While his scoring is higher than LeBron's, LeBron edges him out in rebounds and assists while playing with a weaker supporting cast.
* **Nikola Jokic:** The Joker is a triple-double machine. In his last 30 games, he's averaging 26.4 points, 12.1 rebounds, and 11.5 assists. While Jokic leads in rebounds and assists, LeBron is scoring at a similar clip while demonstrating greater leadership and impact on a less balanced team.

**LeBron is making history.** No one in NBA history has ever performed at this level at 40 years old. Karl Malone won MVP at 35, and LeBron is exceeding those numbers. This is unprecedented territory. He already made history last year by becoming the oldest player to win any kind of MVP award when he won the inaugural In-Season Tournament MVP. A regular season MVP would be another legendary milestone.

**Conclusion**

LeBron James is proving that age is just a number. He's not just playing well for a 40-year-old; he's playing at an MVP level, carrying a flawed Lakers team and putting up historic numbers. While SGA and Jokic are having fantastic seasons, LeBron's performance, leadership, and the sheer defiance of his age make him a truly deserving candidate for the 2024-25 MVP award. His stats and greater win-share over the last 30 games prove it:

LeBrons been amazing but let’s be real || If LeBron played the way he currently is all season I'd agree.

No argument for him over SGA or Jokic with only a month and a half of him playing at this level || Being 40 doesn’t make him the mvp. He is simply not as good as Jokic or SGA. Giannis or Tatum too. He’s 5th at best || This is a terrible take. By your logic, if LeBron played until 50, and averaged 10, 5, and 5, should he win MVP then too, because ""holy shit no one has ever played like this at ***50***""? || If he played like this all season then yeah, but he only playing like this because Luka is on the team now || Feels like a Lebron glazing post lmao. Many thing you mention really had nothing to do with MVP and you credit him everything while ignoring AD starting his year as MVP candidate.

Lebron defying father time, perfoming like that at 40...blah blah has nothing to do with MVP voting, and he is not even the clear best player in that team before the trade, AD were providing DPOY calibre defense while sharing the offensive load, iirc he was among the top MVP leader until they lose to Denvers. 

Also 27/8/8 is not better than what Shai and Jokic is providing lol, not close. I will happily take 34.6 ppg on great efficiency and great defense and triple double monster on all time great efficiency over whatever Lebron is doing right now every days of the week || I love bron, but he’s just not deserving this year, I do think he deserves first team though. || Just Insane, I guess just throw out the numbers & team records. 

Who cares how old LeBron is. MVP comes down to who had the best overall stats plus your team's record.

Jokic is averaging a Triple Double as a Center, Mind Blowing because he's not even trying to get them, it just happens in the flow of the game.

SGA is the leading scorer on the Best team in the Western Conference which is also the Best Defensive team in the league. 

MVP's aren't Lifetime achievement awards. This isn't the Oscars || It's not the ""most valuable player when corrected for age"" award.

I am firmly in the camp of thinking that LeBron should have more mvps than he does and I still think you're making a terrible argument. 

If it were actually an individual award based solely on this season Jokic would win easily. Since it's a media based narrative driven award that for some reason gives you a bonus for playing with better teammates (resulting in more team wins) and Jokic already has multiple mvps and voters are ""fatigued"" it's close and SGA might win.

The way the Lakers are playing LeBron still has a shot at finals mvp, but there's no reasonable argument for him to win mvp this year. || Lmfaoooo lakers are only winning now cause of Luka. LeBron off ball and less strain on him. He has no chance of winning over SGA or joker || Lebron is playing like a top 5 player right now. Not just for the last X weeks, but for the season. Which is astonishing, honestly. He is 4th in the league in VORP and PER as well as 7th in BPM. But he has no statistical argument for MVP with how insane Shai and Jokic have been. They are both a tier above the competition. 


I hope Bron gets 1st team honors, but it would be pretty insulting to give him MVP unless things change dramatically down the stretch.  || AD led the Lakers in Estimated Wins until 2 games ago lol.  Also take a drink every time OP says ""last 30 games"". 

*Warning: do not play the LeMVP Drinking Game while operating heavy machinery.* || I do not think that his age should have an impact on him getting an MVP, it is impressive what he is doing at that age but it shouldn't be a factor. || SGA is playing absolutely bananas right now, it's his to lose. His numbers are bananas, his team is #1, Chet has barely played, and JDub is not as good as he was last season. || Say, how exactly does Lebron have  better leadership and impact compared to Jokic? What did you use to measure it? || I agree. Also, LeBron doing this at 40 shouldn’t be a factor for MVP discussions, his age makes his performance more impressive for sure, but not more valuable

Edit: Just to clarify, I said *shouldn’t*, I understand that the MVP is a narrative award but it *shouldn’t* be || tatum is a convo, but i’d still pick tatum i think. doesn’t really sniff the others even though he is playing out of his mind || Tatum should not even be in the conversation. Zero consistency plus team under performing || lol he’s better than sga, if you’re saying you’d rather have sga for a playoff series than bron you’re out of your mind || I think the idea is more so ""If you average MVP-caliber box score stats and you do something groundbreaking, you automatically enter the MVP conversation,"" probably meaning Top 5-ish. || He started playing like this since AD’s been gone/out. But I agree, lebrons early season really killed his chances. || First Team at 40 years old would be one of the wildest things ever || Narrative is a big deal. But his numbers and even record isn’t good enough either way || In a perfect world, yeah. But narrative does play a part. If it didn't, there's no way Rose wins that 2011 MVP, unless the voters really just don't understand that the Bulls hung their hat on defense and Rose played the Iverson role, keeping a team of elite defenders afloat offensively. Same with Westbrook averaging a triple-double.

LeBron's longevity narrative isn't enough to get him the MVP this year, but the voting process isn't completely free of human emotion and bias. || Eh, they have made exceptions for accomplishing out of the ordinary things, Westbrook’s first triple double season was awarded specifically because that stat line hadn’t been seen as a recent example.

It is hardly ever given to the actual most valuable player.

That being said, I didn’t see how it should be given to anyone other than Jokic this year, he is top 3 in points, assists, rebounds, and steals, shooting at an insane fg% including 44% from 3, with an astronomical PER.

Shari is the only other person with a case. 

But again, I think mvp is more about narratives now so it wouldn’t be out of the question that Lebron doing what he is at 40 could win it. || Nobody besides the top 3 are “in the conversation” but he’s a solid 4th || That's like not the criteria for MVP at all dude || MVP isn’t “who would you want in a hypothetical playoff series that hasn’t happened” it’s about who played the best in the 2024-2025 season || Nah I take Shai over him. The recent seasons has shown Lebron is not the ""if I have to take one player for a playoffs series"" Lebron anymore. He missed the playoffs, cant do anything stop Denvers even when AD playing like the best player in the world and got gentle swept back to back. He is nowhere the Final appearance monster he used to be whereas Shai is entering his prime, providing better scoring and way better defense. || That's still a stupid argument.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.03,0.82,0.151,0.9963,0.102,0.685,0.213,0.9996

Like leading a team to a championship without losing a single game or like averaging a quadruple double for the season. || Roty, All Star, MVP, first member of the 80/60/95 club while averaging a 50 point triple double, DPOTY, first team all everything, at least 74 wins, a clean 16-0 sweep in the playoffs, and finals MVP. Sounds like a 2k challenge. || Id say the benchmark is this hypothetical player would need to turn a team like Charlotte into a contender and win 65+ games while averaging 30+ point triple double while player wemby level defence. But even if a player like this existed and they win every award in one year, I couldn't see them being the GOAT or a candidate. Bevause everyone will just say he won't be able to do it again, he has to prove it wasn't a fluke, etc. Especially since the most important part of the GOAT debate is consistency and prolonged success but id say 3 to 5 years of 55-60+ wins with multiple finals runs with 2+ MVPs and DPOYs would probably be enough to crack into the GOAT debate for greatest peak. || In 2k one time I decided to see what happened when I made the undisputed GOAT player on paper. 7'4"" SF. Averaged 60/25/18/15/2 on 85/60/98 splits for the year. Led the league in every category and broke single season records in 3/5 counting categories and 3/3 splits. Team went undefeated in the regular and post season. Won rookie of the year, dpoy, mvp and finals mvp. 

Even with stupid video game stats like that I think that longevity is valued too highly for GOAT conversations. People will remember the greatest season of all time, sure, and certainly some people would say that person is the GOAT, but I think more people would value multiple rings, multiple MVPs, and for the business side more revenue generated. This hypothetical alien would perhaps be regarded as the best player, but not the greatest of all time I would think. There'd always be an asterisk. || First, get drafted to a bad team with a horrible record and squad depth.

Then, average over 50+ points, 20+ rebounds, 10+ assists, 5+ blocks and 5+ steals per game, and lead your team to the best record or one of the bests. Win the scoring, rebounding, assisting, steals and blocks awards, as well as MVP, ROY and DPOY

After that, lead your team in the playoffs as the absolute one-man army and constantly get triple-teamed or quadruple-teamed but succeed to win the NBA championship. I don't even think you'd need to be undefeated for it to be an unprecedented feat.

Finally, die in a tragic accident while celebrating the title or at least get a major injury that won't allow you to play basketball ever again.

I think this would be good enough to be the undisputed GOAT to ever play basketball, even if it was just a season. || I don't know if it is possible, but just my just to start. 

Championship, MVP, finals MVP, 1st team all nba, DPoY.

You also would probably need some in season records. 

Most points in a season, most assists in a season and either most rebounds, blocks or steals. 

You would also need to do all this while on a team that wasn't good the year before. 

Even then I'm not sure if it's enough. || Not possible. Use kawhi as an example. I think a lot of people recognized he had the potential to be one of the best players ever, but he doesn’t have the longevity to be amongst the greatest of the greats. He has one of the best post seasons runs ever by a player capped off by a FMVP, and another FMVP on top of that, yet he’s still kinda viewed as a “what could’ve been”.

In your hypothetical if a player popped up and averaged 70/25/20/10/10 for one year and then never played in the league again…I think it would still be a “what could’ve been” conversation. I’d say 3 years at the very least would be required. || I think it's tough. In addition to what greatest/greatness meant before, LeBron, whether he's your GOAT or not, has added longevity into factoring a greatest career || To become THE goat, let's say just majority, you cannot play a single season. 

A guy could join this seasons Wizards and average 100 points 40 rebounds and 40 assists, going 82-0 in the regular season and 16-0 in the playoffs vs. healthy Cleveland, Boston, and then OKC, and they would not be the majority GOAT. At best, in the conversation/the occasional person.

I think the least amount of years to get majority vote would be 7, just to achieve 7-0. || I'd guess something like the season I have on 2k 

36 ppg 
22 ast 
5 stl
2 blks 

As a PG

82 - 0 with a title 

I think that'd settle it pretty quickly || I think ppl are overrating how difficult it would be but it depends on your definition of greatest of all time. It always comes down to peak vs longevity. If a player has by far the best season of all time, they will have a case to be considered the goat. In the aspect of greatest player to touch a basketball, not as most successful player in NbA history. Kind of like the NFL where Brady is the goat but a lot of people consider the greatest thrower of a football.

But stat wise, imo if a player is drafted 1st overall by the worst team in the league. If he turns that team into the overall 1 seed with >65 wins and no co star. Along with averaging let’s call it a 40 point triple double with elite defense, and then goes onto dominate in playoffs and win the finals in a single season. He would be my GOAT, as I personally take it as the greatest player to touch a basketball at a given time. || If someone averaged 50 pts a game and won MVP and DPOY in a season and then went on to win FMVP, I'd call them the GOAT tbh || If someone came into the league averaging 50+ pts/10 ast/10 rb.

Last night, while the Lakers and Celtics were on ABC primetime, there was another game in Golden State that was more competitive and had an intense playoff feel with frequent lead changes.

Both the Pistons and Warriors have been playing phenomenal basketball in recent weeks, steadily climbing up the standings.

#Pistons’ Current Matchup

The No. 6 seed in the East led by all star Cade Cunningham would face the No. 3 Knicks. Even with a healthy Jalen Brunson (recently injured his ankle), the Pistons could definitely upset the Knicks (already defeated New York twice at the garden).

#Warriors’ Current Matchup

The No. 6 seed in the West led by the recent member of the 25K club, Steph Curry, would face the No. 3 Lakers. Even with a healthy LeBron James (recently injured his groin), the Warriors could definitely upset the Lakers (especially after acquiring Jimmy Butler; 11-1 in the lineup).

#Avoiding No. 3

This could be the difference between advancing and elimination. The Lakers in particular may see a better matchup with the Grizzlies/Rockets than the Warriors.

The Knicks would have to go on a significant losing streak to not be the 3 seed. The Pistons may go up in seeding to the 4th or 5th seed (Knicks would be in the clear).

#Injuries

Within the last 72 hours, there have been major injuries that will affect how the rest of the season goes for these particular seeds. Nevertheless, the Warriors and Pistons are 2 teams that will not be easy matchups in Round 1 of the postseason.",283,72,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j765cg/the_current_no_6_seeds_in_both_conferences_will/,2025-03-09 07:59:47,"Warriors are much more dangerous because they e been there and have championship DNA. 

The Pistons are a tough out but they are very young. || The Pistons are young and talented, but they also have zero playoff experience. That usually results in an early exit regardless. And if a team did want to dodge the Pistons, they’d face the Pacers or Bucks, who I’d be a lot more worried about. || The Warriors have Steph and the pedigree to be taken seriously. I don't think any serious team is worried about the positions, but they've had a great year and Cade might be all-nba. || Non ""contenders"" you don't want to see in round 1:

Warriors 
Bucks 
Clippers
Suns

High ceilings low floor teams basically. Any of these teams if they are playing well can upset a round 1 matchup. || People are underrating the pistons vets, they might not be elite players but THJ, Beasley, and Tobias are all rotational players and have plenty of playoff experience || The Pistons have been playing great but lets not act like they weren't the worst team in the league last season. Making the playoffs will be a huge success for them but the Knicks are clearly a better team.   
Detroit won on Dec.8 120-111 with Sims as the starting center and KAT as a DNP. Granted on Jan 14. Piston beat the Knicks at home by 5 points, but the Knicks blew out Detroit by 30 points on Nov 1st.  
With Kat and Mitch back for a 7 game series Pistons might sneak a game but nothing more. || I personally would not be worried for OKC or CLE with those matchups in the first round. || Nobody should want to play either of those teams. The Dubs are the hottest team in the league since the Jimmy trade, despite most of their games being on the road. And they’ve done this without Kuminga, who should be coming back from an ankle any day now. And they have Steph…and playoff Jimmy. Plus Draymond will kick you in the balls. Literally. 

The Pistons are a completely different team over the last 20 games. Cade is playing at an all-NBA level, Beasley can’t seem to miss (42% on 9.2 threes per game!), and Ausar is borderline all defense. They’re young, sure, but I like their chances against the Knicks. || You clearly haven’t watched JB Bickerstaff try to run an offense in the playoffs || The ""Pistons have zero playoff experience"" is such a BS trope.  They have over 200 games of playoff experience in their rotation between Tobias Harris, Tim Hardaway, Malik Beasley, and Dennis Schroeder.  Their coaching staff is led by a HC who has led teams to the playoffs, and they have an experienced assistant staff.  Are they AS EXPERIENCED with their playmaker Cade and HC?  No, definitely not.  But this isn't some team that's going to get to the postseason and lay down because the lights are too bright.  Have you seen how Detroit plays this season?  They scrap with everyone.  They even tried to fight Steph Curry.  I mean this with all due respect, but Detroit is almost too stupid to realize they shouldn't be as competitive as they are.

I think they beat Indy in a series and give hell to NY.  Milwaukee would be tough. || I don’t think people realize how different the basketball games are in the playoffs (far higher % half court sets vs. transition)

Or account for how “caught up in the moment” players get. Especially the ones who haven’t been there before, or gone as deep

I don’t think the pistons get more than a game on the Knicks if everyone’s healthy

Warriors for sure can beat the rockets or grizzlies, rockets more so. I’d favor them in either matchup but nuggets or lakers would both beat gsw in 5/6

Grizzlies far deeper than gsw but many of their young players make dumb mistakes, and Ja been throwing temper tantrums when he doesn’t get calls throwing himself into dudes, which you tend not to get more of in the playoffs || The Pistons won't. It's a jbb team. He won't make adjustments and try to brute force it. || Warriors are not doing anything in the postseason. They’re too small and reliant on Steph to shoot lights out every game. || [removed] || Agreed.
Most young core never been in a competative team.

As a pistons fan, i love this team, they might win a playoff game or two, but that's all. || Also, the Warriors are much better than their record. Since adding Butler, they've looked like one of the best teams in the West. || With the Brunson injury it may be the bucks the pistons end up playing! || Suns defense is beyond awful, they are not beating a 1/2 seed.

Bucks will prob be 4th so no top team can see them in the 1st round.

Clippers with Norm can be a tough out.

Warriors if they play Hoston/Memphis sure, the other top teams should beat them. || Suns aren’t getting out of the playin || You saying that actually convinced me less than before I read this. If you’re relying on the veteran leadership of THJ Beasley and Tobias, you aren’t doing shit. What have those 3 ever done in the playoffs. || Nov 1st pistons were a VERY different team, guys made jumps, Schroeder and Ausar changed a lot for this team || Agree that that trope is often trotted out more than it needs to be, as a Thunder fan I know that for sure. But I suppose one could argue that the lack of playoff experience together could be a little bit of a factor. Given the choice between those guys having independent playoff experience or playoff experience as a unit, you’d definitely take the latter. But I suppose the bit that’s up for debate is whether the benefit would be massive or negligible. I suppose it’s not really a question that can be answered as only one outcome can come true, but it’s something to think about. 

Then again, the unit has looked good this regular season, so maybe that translates to the playoffs. I just wonder if it’s going to be a bit of a roadblock for these guys who don’t know what effect, say, getting clamped by the same team for the first two games might have on their teammate and whether they can trust them to bounce back in the following games.

I feel like the Allen Iverson trade slowed down Melo’s growth, both skill-wise and as a leader.

Melo Was on Track to Develop an All-Around Game

Before AI arrived in Denver, Melo was starting to expand his game beyond just scoring. He was improving as a playmaker and showing signs of becoming the undisputed leader of the Nuggets. At the start of the 2006-07 season, he was averaging 31.6 PPG and looking like he could develop into a more complete player—similar to LeBron at that time.

But once Iverson joined, the offense turned into a “my turn, your turn” system. Instead of Melo growing into the kind of player who dictated everything on the court, he had to share ball-handling and scoring duties with another high-usage player. That slowed his natural progression toward being a well-rounded superstar.

LeBron Had the Freedom to Grow—Melo Didn’t

Compare this to LeBron’s situation in Cleveland during the same era. The Cavs built everything around LeBron, allowing him to be the unquestioned leader and primary decision-maker. Without another superstar competing for shots and possessions, LeBron naturally evolved into an elite playmaker and all-around force.
	•	2007 LeBron: Led the Cavs to the Finals with complete control over the offense.
	•	2009 LeBron: Won MVP, averaging 28-7-7, because the entire system was built around his strengths.
	•	2010 LeBron: Put up one of the most dominant individual seasons ever before heading to Miami.

Melo, on the other hand, was never given that same level of control because Iverson’s presence forced Denver to play a different style. Instead of refining his playmaking and leadership, he was primarily used as a go-to scorer.

Iverson’s Presence Delayed Melo’s Leadership Growth

Another major issue was leadership. AI was a dominant personality, and while he wasn’t a traditional leader, his presence meant Melo didn’t have to fully step up. Instead of learning how to take over a team and hold teammates accountable, Melo had the luxury of deferring at times.

It wasn’t until Chauncey Billups arrived in 2008 that Melo had a veteran who actually pushed him to be a more mature leader. That’s a big reason why the Nuggets finally made a deep playoff run in 2009. If Denver had focused on Melo’s all-around growth earlier—like Cleveland did with LeBron—his trajectory could have been different.

Final Thoughts

Had Denver built the team around Melo’s complete game rather than pairing him with another high-usage scorer, I think he could have developed into a more well-rounded superstar, similar to LeBron. The AI trade might have been exciting in the moment, but in the long run, it probably slowed down Melo’s evolution as both a player and a leader.",170,98,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j6drah/did_the_allen_iverson_trade_stunt_carmelo/,2025-03-08 04:39:57,"I don't like to do hypotheticals with Melo. 

Sure, maybe some extra time as the unquestioned leader in Denver could've been transformative. But you could just as easily make the argument that playing alongside another ball-dominant player should've forced Melo to develop as an off-ball player, practice his contribution to set plays where he isn't the focus, finetune his defensive effort, and so on. 

Melo is an all-time scorer. He'll almost certainly get into the Hall of Fame, and whatever my feelings as a Denver fan might be, he will almost certainly deserve it. But there were always limitations to his game, and despite all the moments where it looked like he might finally work on them, he never really stuck with it for long. 

It's rough, but I don't think any one moment in his career prevented him from developing into a different kind of superstar. He just spent his career deciding not to do that. || So when Carmelo was playing with the Knicks and the injuries started happening to Amare, Carmelo was forced to play a lot of power forward. He did it so much that he is actually listed as a PF for 2 seasons and he played it very well. It was probably the best basketball of his career, rebounds were up and he was more efficient. Carmelo is a big slow SF but at PF he had an athletic advantage over almost everyone. Even with all of that evidence, he essentially refused to continue playing that position. To me that sums up Carmelo, he refuses to grow as player, happy to stay in the lane he’s always been in. || [removed] || No if anything melo plays best with a point guard who passes and runs an offense. Melo can’t be like LeBron, Luka, etc because he was usually a selfish player looking for his own shots instead of creating for others and passing. 

It’s ironic that LeBron won a scoring title before melo and yet LeBron has played with a huge passing game from the get go. || Melo stunted his own growth by never committing to defense, facilitation and movement without the ball

  
P.S. He was my favorite player growing up because I did not understand the importance of the above || No, I don’t think so. His refusal to put any consistent effort on defense was always going to be a problem, not even having Chauncey Billups as his mentor motivated him to try to become more of a locker room leader or team player. Melo, for all his talent, skills, and physical gifts, has always been about himself moreso than buying into a team first mentality. Hell, he wouldn’t even wait for free agency to join up with his childhood friends in LeBron and Wade and instead rushed to sign a contract instead as soon as he could, the Miami Heatles was originally supposed to be Melo instead of Bosh but Melo went after the money instead. || No, his problem wasn’t on offense at all. Melo was a walking bucket whether he tried or not. The main problem with him was his own effort and focus on non-scoring parts of his game. Remember Olympic Melo where he hustled all the time? He was like that against marquee match ups vs Kobe, LeBron, DWade, but barely try against no name teams. He was famously known for playing ip to the level of his competition and teammate with the Nuggets. 

When AI came into town, I remember Karl asking him to become more of a rebounder and an off ball defender, and his rebounds went up quite a hit but he looked really unhappy doing so. George Karl might’ve been an asshole, but he was completely correct in identifying that Melo barely tried when it wasn’t a big game. || Iverson was only there for 2 seasons. This would be like saying Westbrook stunted the development of Austin Reaves. || I don’t remember all-around Melo.  I was just bummed when he got away from his post game which was phenomenal || I understand your perspective and it’s an interesting thought. I can’t say that he was stunted but I do remember him being an all around player at some point. I remember he went from just scoring to actually playing and controlling a game and playing within a system. 

He was passing more, posting up, playing defense, and looked like a great top player in the league at that time. Then for some reason it all stopped. I remember those days of Melo. 

I watch his podcast and he talks about when Iverson came they decided to go back and forth and take turns. So, maybe you are right there. || [removed] || The trade of Billips for AI was what the team and Melo needed, but Melo is Melo - he just wanted to score and don’t think much would have changed who he is || No early indications that Melo had passing/playmaking chops. This feels more like narrative than analysis. Lebron came into the league a passer.

If Iverson being there for a couple seasons that much of an obstacle for Melo, then his potential was too fragile to have much chance at success.

Players are supposed to play with other players. Thinking guys “need their own teams” was a dumb paradigm from the early 2000s that resulted in things like Marbury leaving KG and Tmac leaving Vince. || [removed] || [removed] || I think he's the most overrated player of modern times. I would say to what Howard next. They were both incredibly incomplete. Built to leverage their skills properly but neither player with smart enough to fine tune himself. They both were way too egotistical and focused on scoring as a detriment of their team.  || This is the reality of Carmelo [Game of Zones: Melo’s time in Houston](https://youtu.be/6SGvnwsbf88) || Definitely didn’t stunt his growth and remember melo got suspended for that fight right before AI got traded to Denver. I believe melo was leading league in scoring or at least top 2 when he got suspended. || He literally chose the bag over playing with his friends and forming a big 3, nearly guaranteeing a championship. 

He stunted his own growth || They traded AI for Chauncey Billups who led the Nuggets to the WCF.  So no, Carmelo just isn’t a KD level player. || I don't think Melo ever had (or would have had) the desire or ability to grow into the allo around superstar people wanted him to become.  
He was an extremely gifted scorer with holes in his game and conditioning , him being a top 5 player in the league was the anomaly , not the rule.  
Iso scoring was highly valued at the time , today he would probably be a top 10-15 player in the league , he never had the talent for playmaking. || No, analytics destroyed Melo’s game.. the same way it did to Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose and many others. We learned their style of basketball is inefficient so teams went away from running their offense through them. || What stunt his growth was the early success. He came into the league when the hype was around LeBron. But Melo had more success in the first couple of years where he carried his team into the playoffs. And his team often beat LeBron's team head to head. Melo always thought he was the better player and so he got big headed. 

Eventually, LeBron got better and started to live up to his hype as a generational player, while Melo was just a really good player and he stayed there. 

During the 2008 Olympics when the Redeem Team won gold, Kobe influenced LeBron, Wade, and KD to pay better defensively. They went back to NBA and show improvements in their game, but Melo stay the same. To him, he was Kobe's equal and so didn't need to learn anything. He got big headed due to early NBA success and never bother to improve his game. || Melo didn't give any signs of developing as a passer or on defense. Allen Iverson played for 135 games on Denver in 2 years. Thats not a lot. Sure, having both of them on the floor was not a good thing but Carmelo was always a scorer and a little bit of a rebounder, nothing more. Its not on Iverson or anyone other than Carmelo. || Honestly, this reads as a someone who didn’t watch that in the moment. Unfortunately, Melo hit his ceiling regardless of others. He was an incredible bucket getter and a big body who could shuffle his feat on D, allowing him to guard 2-4. 

But he was a bucket-getter first and foremost. That’s why he and AI didnt work. || Since you bring up the ‘09 playoffs let’s not forget when Chauncey melo and the nugs beat cp3 and NO by 60 in a playoff game || On the Knicks Melo had a chance to grow but he chose to stay the same Melo. Melo stunted his own growth Look at Harden who was forced to play differently with CP3. 

He grew into a true pg on the Nets and Sixers. Now we’re seeing a different Harden on the Clippers. || In what was one of his best seasons, that 12-13 knicks season, he averaged 28.7 ppg and 2.6 assists. A big time offensive engine type of player should be getting at 5-6 assists at the least with those kinds of points, gotta generate more team offense than that if you want to be one of the best offensive players in the league. || Melo's leadership growth?  You're talking about potential that wasn't there.  Melo is a follower.

LeBron is a natural born leader, so it wasn't a matter of LeBron having room to grow into it.  It was already there.

Melo even felt the reality of that dynamic because he became a follower of LeBron himself very early in their relationship when they were still teenagers.  Next thing you know Melo is on the banana boat.

Recall when LeBron saved Melo's life in the Bahamas:

>*I look up and the current is taking me into the middle of the ocean, opposite from the boat.  Then I look up at the boat and I see Bron, Bron jumps off the boat like he's MacGyver. He jumps off the boat into the water. He was bringing me back with one arm. He's swimming with the other arm, and he's carrying in one arm. That was special. He saved my life.*

LeBron has a charisma, presence and natural leadership qualities that Melo doesn't have and would never be able to cultivate. || Imagine if AI got traded to the Cavs - him and Lebron would’ve been electric. 

I think people are who they are and knowing melo for 20 years of public spotlight - he’s more in line with Kobe mentality (minus the killer mindset.)",0.0,0.755,0.245,0.3818,0.028,0.85,0.122,0.9923,0.081,0.775,0.144,0.9992

#Realism

You rarely see teams in which their best 2 players just came together make deep runs in the postseason.

At best, a semifinals appearance would be an achievement.

#Delusion

Lakers have a lot of championships in team history (17). The Warriors have won the most championships in the last decade (4).

That’s as far as the championship talk should go for these 2 organizations this year.

Cavaliers, Thunder and Celtics (the only 3 teams in the 50-Win club so far) should be the clear favorites to win the title.

#Nostalgia

Would a postseason be more entertaining featuring Curry/Butler & James/Doncic?

For most NBA fans, absolutely! Especially for LeBron (who just continues to breach the barriers of physical fitness at age 40).",227,232,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ji48u1/who_will_go_further_in_the_playoffs_this_season/,2025-03-23 13:13:21,"Lakers have two generational super processors running the show and much more matchup versatility than the Warriors. Worth seeing the bracket before making a call I guess but I’d feel confident picking them. || I’ll admit I was wrong about Jimmy on the Warriors (I just didn’t think he would have the impact he’s had) but I’m still going the Lakers. Fact of the matter is you’re running two once-in-a-lifetime offensive talents and it is incredibly difficult to beat a team like that 4 out of 7 times. || Lakers. Matchup hunting is more effective for the most part and they have both Lebron and Luka, who are the probably the 2 best ever matchup hunting players ever. Both teams have massive roster flaws, with both being generally pretty small. The Lakers other main advantage is that Luka and Bron both need the same type of player to guard them, its highly unlikely for a team to have 2 of them. || Lakers have more overall talent imo, but playoffs are all about matchups. It’s very possible the answer to this question is just who has the best path || When healthy? I’d say warriors shouldn’t be underestimated.

I’m basing this on a recent vid I saw which mentioned Phil Jackson’s book. That there’s 5(?) types of teams and at the pinnacle is “zen teams.”  These zen teams, like the 2014 Spurs, play as one organism. 

You don’t have to worry about your own shot when you trust your team mates as an extension of yourself. Jimmy and Draymond definitely embody this level of play. They’re also high IQ.

The thing is, Lakers have LeBron & Luka who are also very high IQ. Likely more so.

So individually, Lakers have more talent, generational star power.

But Warriors seem to have already figured out who they are. Which is shocking since the Jimmy trade just happened. Usually it takes a minute for teams to gel. This tells me that a strong system exists in the warriors and Jimmy has already bought in.

Will be interesting to see. || Im biased but lakers. Luka and lebron can both takeover games and as long as the role players perform and nobody is injured i think the lakers can beat anyone. A healthy squad next year with more bigs will make them contenders imo. Also reaves is insane, there are only a few third options in the league that can also take over like him || Personally lakers, LeBron and Luka are too good of a match, and their prospective sub doesn’t clown their own coach saying that they need to go. Reddick has done nothing but make him and his team take accountability every time. When you’re playing the same team to four wins; I think that matters the most. || lakers are the better team but i don't see neither of them beating denver or okc || I value playoff experience a lot. The teams that go far are the ones with stars that have been there before. Every year, the experienced teams are the ones that cause the most upsets. 


Other than Denver and Phoenix, the West is pretty young. I honestly could see either of these teams sneaking through into the Western Conference finals. OKC probably wins, but their lack of playoff experience is a big question mark for them.  || who ever of the two stays more healthy. players like vando, dfs, and even hayes are crucial for the lakers to make a deep run. the warriors core is obviously older, and really important to the team || As a Celtic fan with equal hate to both teams, it’s a toss up. Warriors got a better system but I think the lakers got a deeper/ more experienced team 

warriors top 3 can certainly out grind more inexperienced teams and get away with a lot of 50/50 calls 

Honestly think they’re both likely second round exits, with the lakers likelier to lose to the thunder in the WCF || The Warriors. The Lakers have no front court whatsoever and Luka gets exposed on D in the playoffs. Plus I trust Jimmy and Steph in the post-season. || [removed] || The more Reaves handles the ball, the deeper LA will go and the more they distance themselves from GS.  GSW doesn’t have a role player with Reaves’ impact, the way Reaves creates the kinda vortex of greatness around key pieces like LeBron and Doncic.  Doncic gotta keep with the flow, tho. || Honestly, my opinion is that this is all much ado about nothing.  I think it's likely both teams end up in the bottom of the bracket and don't make it out of the first round.  I think it's very likely GSW ends up in 6th and gets beat.  The Lakers could be in the 4-5 and win that, but OKC will not be beaten in the West. || Gotta go with the warriors. I believe playoff jimmy who carried a team to the finals still exists, and this is the best team he’s been on || I think it will heavily depend on who wins more games in their respective series.

That will ultimately determine who will go further in this years playoffs. Who knows?! Both might make it equally as far || I think both of these teams lack rim protection and would normally be exposed in the playoffs. Making them at best second round exits. Neither team would typically go to the WCF.

However, the NBA this season has been probably the worst reffed season in recenty memory. We all know that both of these teams are going to have a favored whistle against teams like the Rockets, Wolves, Grizzlies, or Clippers. || If the west standings stay the same, the Lakers first round matchup looks way better than the Warriors. Lakers would play Memphis and would win easily IMO, while the Warriors would play the Nuggets and would lose the series easily. || I don’t think either team is going far but the Warriors have the potential to be first round exits with how poorly Jimmy has shot the ball since the trade and how hot and cold Steph has been at times this season shooting his 3s, I don’t think that’s happening to a Luka / Lebron team || The Warriors have been on a YO-YO ride all season. If they can time it right, they would have as a chance of anyone winning it all. If not, they run the chance of not evening making it to a play-in game. || I mean, technically the playoffs won’t have any bad teams for Lakers to lose to, as it seems like they beat most good teams, and lose to every bad team… || Probably LA. They are the fifth seed and one game away from clinching the third seed away from the Nuggets. If that happens and the warriors are a play in who have to face OKC first round then….goodbye Warriors in a tough six game series. OKC too tough for them in a 7 game series. || I can see the lakers in the finals. 

I can’t see warriors past round 1 MAYBE 2. || As the bracket looks right now, it's Lakers vs Warriors. Lebron has a good history against Steph in the playoffs when Steph didnt have KD. And he has Luka now too. So im thinking it's going to be Lebron in this case. I see the Lakers going to the 2nd round, possibly WCF and then stopping there. || NBA season and NBA playoffs are 2 different beasts. More so than any other sport. While NVA is a team sport, it’s also one where ONE good player can carry a team. Just look at the LeBron Cavaliers to see how true that is.

I say this because there are VERY few players who can carry a team like that. And the Lakers got TWO of them. 

Luka alone could take Lakers deep into the playoffs. LeBron alone could take Lakers deep into the playoffs.

Them just turning the switch on come playoffs and dominating is really not out of the question.

Hell look at who Luka took to the finals last year. Now he had a seemingly ageless LeBron on his team too? These guys gonna win the title. || Neither should be favored to win.
But both could under the right circumstances. || Doubt either team will make it past the 2nd round.  Lakers have 3 starters who are bad defenders. When teams game plan for them, I think they are in huge trouble.  
Gsw offense depends on curry who can be real streaky.  When he goes cold for a couple games they will be done. || Lakers had an 8 game winning streak where they were winning by 2 points over the clippers and just lost by 30 to the Bulls with LeBron back. They’re playing Alex Len serious minutes. Golden state had been the best team by net rating since the trade deadline until curry got injured. Playoff success comes down to more than 2 players lol, but frankly I think both teams ultimately get crushed by OKC in a 7 game series. Neither is an actual great team, warriors got a bit more depth and balance at least. || Warriors aren't as good as they're looking right now. They went against a lot of weak or injured teams or teams they are better in matchups. They're not getting passed 2nd round and they better not run into lakers bc they'll get destroyed.

Im a D1 certified lebron and lakers hater with a PhD in the matter but a healthy lakers can easily get to the CF. 

My bet is on lakers especially since a lot were just injured but took a long rest. Lebron needed that all star and groin injury rest. He's gonna look good the following weeks

An analytical deep-dive.,"It's well established that defense is the hardest thing to capture in basketball, with stats. We have a plethora of amazing stats to illustrate a player's impact offensively, but defensive stats, especially if used in solitude can be shoddy and filled with noise. Do a lot of blocks make somebody a good defender? Steals? DBPM?   
  
Obviously there's more to the story, hence why it's important to weed through which ones are actually of value, and use multiple validated stats to provide a complete contextual view.

*So I did just that*. I used 6 different statistics, and a player's percentile in those stats to identify his place among the rest of the NBA:  
  
1. Defensive Points Per Possession (PPP) Allowed  
2. Defensive EPM  
3. Defensive On/Off  
4. On Court DRTG  
5. Team's Defensive Ranking  
6. Defensive FG% 

To be included, candidates needed to either  
\- Have available DPOY odds on fanduel   
\- Have an on-court DRTG of <113 (about 60th percentile)

I only included players who fit the above criteria that *might* get a single all-defensive team vote (sorry Jalen Green/James Harden), who are on pace to play 65+ games and who play moderately high minutes.

**You can view the spreadsheet here:** [**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13CL-wpXffPtj4E\_k1sSd8tHVfNbQwPEpvXpTVUorwkQ/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13CL-wpXffPtj4E_k1sSd8tHVfNbQwPEpvXpTVUorwkQ/edit?usp=sharing)

And feel free to read below for a brief explanation of each stat and why it was chosen. **Some of the percentiles are relative to the rest of the NBA, some of them are relative to the rest of the candidates. I have marked either as such.**

**1. Synergy Defensive PPP**

This is basically how many points a player allows on ALL possessions that they are the primary defender. This includes when guarding all play-types such as pick n rolls, isolations, post ups, transition, off screens, cuts, putbacks etc. This includes every possession a defender guarded where the offensive player took a shot, turned it over or got to the FT line. I believe it also includes possessions where the offensive player got  an assist in Pick n Rolls.

Each player's defensive PPP is given a percentile, **relative to the rest of the NBA**, where 50th percentile is league average

**2. Defensive EPM**

By now, most of you are probably familiar with DunksAndThrees Estimated Plus Minus or EPM. It is an adjusted plus-minus model that is regularized and regressed to kill noise and actually offer insight into a player's impact on the court, above regular plus minus. It is basically the gold standard that stats like LEBRON, BPM, DPM etc. try to emulate and widely-regarded as the most well-validated and accurate adjusted plus minus model, so I chose to use its defensive stats as part of the picture. 

Each player's defensive EPM is given a percentile, **relative to the rest of the NBA**, where 50th percentile is league average

**3. Defensive On/Off Swing (PBP Stats)**

This is pretty straightforward, it is looking at a team's defensive rating (DRTG: points allowed per 100 possessions) with a player on the court vs. a team's DRTG with that player on the bench. Theoretically, a more impactful defensive player is going to cause a larger improvement in his team's DRTG than a less impactful defensive player. On/Off certainly has some noise, but it's generally one of the most relevant stats for deducing impact, particularly when it's put into context (which I'm hoping will be assisted by the inclusion of 5 other useful stats)

I was unable to get a defensive on/off percentile for everybody in the NBA, and thus each player's defensive on/off was given a percentile, **relative to the rest of the DPOY ""candidates""**, where 50th percentile is average among the other top defenders

**4. On Court DRTG**

On/Off is important, but the most important part of the on/off equation is the ""on"" part. Awards aren't won when a player is on the bench. And, ideally, a top defensive candidate should at the very least have his team's defense looking great when he's on the court.

I was unable to get a defensive on/off percentile for everybody in the NBA, and thus each player's defensive on/off was given a percentile, **relative to the rest of the DPOY ""candidates""**, where 50th percentile is average among the other top defenders

**5. Team Defensive Ranking**

The defense that a player is anchoring/playing on provides important context to this.  
  
A) Anchoring an elite defense matters. Being the anchor of a top 5 defense is a lot more important in the conversation than being the anchor of a bottom 10 defense.

B) A team's ranking is essential to contextualize on/off rankings. It takes an elite defensive player to add to and improve an already elite defensive line-up, however an average defensive player will see impressive defensive on/off swings by simply being the least garbage defender on a team filled with garbage defenders.

Improving a bottom 5 defense by 1pt DRTG is not impressive and not even definitive proof of being a good defender. Improving a top 5 defense by 1pt DRTG will get you in the DPOY discussion (noise aside). 

Each player's team is given a percentile, **relative to the rest of the NBA**, where the #1 ranked defense would be 100% percentile and the #30 ranked defense would be 0th percentile.

**6. Defensive FG% Swing**

This is simply the difference in FG% players shoot on average of specific shot attempts vs. the % players shoot on those same shot attempts when defended by the player in question. e.g. if a player shoots 50% on a his shot attempt on average, but 45% on those same attempts when guarded by the player, the player's defensive FG% would be -5% (lower is better). 

I was unable to get a defensive FG% percentiles for everybody in the NBA, and thus each player's defensive FG% was given a percentile, **relative to the rest of the DPOY ""candidates""**, where 50th percentile is average among the other top defenders

This is wildly overstating D-EPM's status in the analytics community.  Of the 3 best-regarded publicly available advanced metrics, D-LEBRON consistently gives the best results for defense vs eyetest.

Also averaging a regressed stat with raw On/Off and On Court DRTG is just watering down the regression.  Using Synergy Def-PPP seems to have negative value.  Any weight for Team DRTG (for ""who should get it"" not trying to recreate voter biases) is laughable.  None of these are weighted for opposition like any good advanced metric would be.  So in the end you came up with a worse flavor of D-EPM.

If you want to just average things, a good start might be to just average the best advanced metrics - D-EPM, D-DPM, D-LEBRON, xRAPM Defense, etc.  Here's [a list I compiled over the ASB](https://old.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ioefjc/who\_is\_the\_2425\_dpoy/mcp7d9i/). || Zubac is severely underrated in this year’s DPOY convo.

It’s easier to defend after a bucket than a turnover, and especially easy to defend after free throws. So SGA improves OKC’s defensive rating by getting to the line a lot. Without Jokic the nuggets turn it over a lot and give up more in transition.

This effect is real in the stats but most people don’t like to include it in their mental model of what defence really is. Generally people think of defence as how much you change the odds of the opponents’ scoring situations. Giving the opponent fewer breaks and more half-court doesn’t feel like defence as such. || I'm just here to say that SGA's defense should put him firmly in control of the MVP. 

Everyone wants to compare box score bullshit and point to Jokic ""gEts SteAlZ"", but SGA is truly an elite player on both ends of the floor while Jokic is a known liability on D. || Amazing that Gobert leads this analysis even though most people would probably say he's well past his prime and on a downward trajectory. If he's leading this year I imagine he'd be even more dominant in prior years. As a jazz fan I've watched his career since his rookie season.

Jordan was averaging career highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks under Doug Collins. He won dpoy. He was at minimum the 2nd best individual player of all time (Wilt has a strong case for the top spot). He won the MVP… but he wasn’t the best player in the world & if that continued he would NEVER be the goat. It wouldn’t matter if he teamed up with Hakeem and Drexler winning 6 titles. He wasn’t playing wining basketball. 

Under Doug Collins MJ played like LeBron, Luka, Harden. Give him the ball at the top of the key and spam ISO’s and pnr. He was doing everything. It was EASY for the defense to defend Jordan WITH the ball. That was their entire focus. Blitz, trap, double team.. force someone else to beat you.. It looked like he had no help.

Under Phil, he learned how to be a winner. Actually dominating basketball games while scoring less, rebounding less, assisting less.. steals and blocks down.. but he was dominating more… and working even harder. The defense now needed to stop the ball primarily.. and worry about Jordan secondarily. You can’t double off ball.. so Jordan was able to come off screens and go up immediately… before the double team got there. Small guy on him.. he could post up.. go up immediately before the double got there. No good looks? He didn’t even need to do anything, just catch the ball.. wait patiently for the double team.. and become a decoy.. allowing his team to play 4v3. 
Now he had arrived as the best in the world..

The isolation, ball dominance gets you the most stats..and makes the best individual players.. but that doesn’t make the best basketball players if we’re focused on winning games. ",0,23,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jjgcky/if_jordan_continued_playing_the_way_he_did_in_1988/,2025-03-25 06:36:56,"[removed] || I enjoy a good MJ debate with my morning coffee, but I’m not sure you’ve brought anything to the table here that hasn’t already been talked about a great deal. Most of us know that MJ sacrificed stats and control when the Bulls implemented the triangle, and yes that happened around the same time he began winning titles. However, many people point out that Pippen’s ascent to complementary star also coincided with that timeframe. Which may or may not have been a result of MJ taking a step back. And that the Bulls’ role players also developed to the point that both Horace Grant and BJ Armstrong were all-stars by 1994. Again, maybe due to MJ sharing the load, but maybe not. 

There is also the issue that the game was played in a very different way in those days, which made heliocentric offenses less effective. There was much more limited spacing, and few guys who could team up on pick and rolls. Instead of modern, athletic bigs springing for lobs or popping to the three point line, you had awkward bruisers who often preferred scoring on inefficient isos. And collapsing the defense only to kick out for an 18 footer is not a good strategy long term. 

Today, outside of Steph Curry, who is a singularly dangerous off ball threat, there just doesn’t seem to be a path to winning by intentionally keeping the ball out of your best shot creator’s hands. The game is exhausting enough that adding additional less impactful duties to your star is going to offer diminishing returns. KD is probably a good example of this- he plays a bit like triangle era MJ, more by necessity than design, as his inability to lean further into heliocentrism seems to hamper his impact.

I’m not necessarily discounting your narrative. I think it’s actually quite possible that it’s still correct. The triangle is a rather fascinating anomaly in the history of the league, and it’s significant that its principles contributed to teams winning nine titles in 12 years. I’m still not sure if that’s due to superior X’s and O’s or merely the way it allowed Phil Jackson to pull his zen master voodoo on his teams’ egos. || [removed] || > He was at minimum the 2nd best individual player of all time

He was on that trajectory sure but after a 5 year career, he wasn't yet definitely better than Bird, Magic, Kareem, Wilt, or Russell if he had stopped right there.

> but he wasn’t the best player in the world & if that continued he would NEVER be the goat. It wouldn’t matter if he teamed up with Hakeem and Drexler winning 6 titles. He wasn’t playing wining basketball.

I'm not convinced. He did have some lessons to learn about when to feed his teammates - e.g. Phil Jackson's famous ""Who's open, Michael?"" moment - but a big difference really was that he had better teammates around him. I think 1987-1990 MJ still wins 5-6 rings if you put him on the same Bulls team from 1991-1993 and 1995-1998. He was more heliocentric because he kind of had to be, but he was still creating plenty beforehand and sometimes it looked like he had no help because he really didn't have that much of it. || [removed] || [removed] || [removed] || It has nothing to do with the triangle specifically. The Spurs ran a 3 point motion offense. The 60 win Hawks under Budenholzer same thing. The Celtics don’t just put it in Tatums hands and watch. 

Any system works… as long as the superstar (teammates follow) buys in.

Anyone watching how Jordan played realizes he made a conscious effort to get his teammates involved and build their confidence. He needed them, he needed to be able to to trust them, and he had to nurture and develop them first. 

Bill Russell has a famous quote
“The most important measure of how good a game I played was how much better I'd made my teammates play”

That was how Jordan was playing now, more concerned with the production he could get out of his teammates. He accepted double teams, became a decoy.. and picked defenses apart, giving teammates 2v1 on the weak side. He took over when games got close, but he was using his teammates as much as possible, and trying to let them have the show. || Lebron plays a very heliocentric style of basketball. He spammed ISO’s when he was younger, now he spam’s pick and rolls until he gets a switch and then he spams ISO’s… because that’s what every heliocentric superstar does in the NBA today. 

He’s very similar to Doug Collins MJ.. he’s just not the same shot creator.. and obviously not the same defender but he was elite in his early Cavs days too. Where they truly dominate is transition basketball..not so much half court. || That’s why said “individual player” he was better than those guys other than Wilt individually. He wasn’t better as a team player. Bird and Magic were clearly still better players than him. 

Jordan built those guys confidence. He made a conscious effort every game, all season long to allow his teammates to do as much as possible. He started games getting them involved, He built leads for them by taking over, he accepted double teams, rotated the ball and let them play 2v1… he was getting guys emotionally invested and helping them build their confidence… that lead to them giving more consistent effort instead of standing around watching him.

The famous Bill Russell quote
“The most important measure of how good a game I played was how much better I'd made my teammates play.”

Jordan played that way and was a completely different player..that’s why his teammates looked so much better. They developed those habits all season long. || We don't allow posts on player rankings or player comparisons on this subreddit.

You are taking a very narrow look at certain stats and using them to paint your  narrative without painting the whole picture. There were more assists per game in Jordan's 8 assist season than any season of the first 17 seasons of Lebron's career. Pace was also significantly higher for that season than all of Lebron's save for 2. || We don't allow posts on player rankings or player comparisons on this subreddit.

lenitently progressively since the 60’s. So the late 80’s was far more lenient than the 60’s and this era is far more lenient than this era. Meaning he would have had more if they were scored by today’s statisticians. 

Pace is a completely different topic, but nice deflection. Lebron has had 2 seasons with a higher pace than 88 you say. So did Jordan have more than 2 seasons with a higher pace than 88? Whose career has had a higher average pace. Both favor Jordan. Even when you try to make up a completely new topic, it fails. 

This wasn’t to be a comparison about these 2 guys, it’s about the heliocentric playing style being bad basketball even though it produces better statistics for the individual player. || Jordan has routinely said Moncrief and Dumars were the best defenders he ever faced. That was from that era. They also had Jordan himself and Michael cooper in that era. The defenders were just as quick.

Maybe you’re thinking because they were bigger, they were slower. Which is true, but those weren’t guards. They had guys like Oakley, Rodman, and Larry Bird playing SF when they would be PFs and Centers today.. so yeah they are obviously slower laterally and the centers are slower laterally.. but that wouldn’t help a guy that wants to score his points at the rim. That makes it more difficult. || > That’s irrelevant.. everyone with any basketball knowledge realizes that assists have been scored more lenitently progressively since the 60’s. So the late 80’s was far more lenient than the 60’s and this era is far more lenient than this era. Meaning he would have had more if they were scored by today’s statisticians.

So now we aren't even using data or stats or experience to make your arguemnts? Just blind assertions? 

>Pace is a completely different topic, but nice deflection.

Pace and PPG directly affect assists. ""everyone with any basketball knowledge realizes this"". 

>Lebron has had 2 seasons with a higher pace than 88 you say. So did Jordan have more than 2 seasons with a higher pace than 88? Whose career has had a higher average pace.

Again, more made up stats. Pace during Jordans 15 years is actually higher than the pace over Lebron's career. 

>This wasn’t to be a comparison about these 2 guys, it’s about the heliocentric playing style being bad basketball even though it produces better statistics for the individual player.

Yeah but even your descriptions of how players are used has been incorrect on top of your stats being wrong/misleading. || >  They had guys like Oakley, Rodman, and Larry Bird playing SF when they would be PFs and Centers today..

In what world was Oakley a SF? He was never a SF. Rodman also didn't play SF for the vast majority of his career. Bird also didn't really play SF until he hurt his back. 

As far as bigger, the average NBA height is about the same now as it was then. || Bird also was assigned to PF on defense even after he moved to SF for the most part.",0.0,0.833,0.167,0.2023,0.1,0.667,0.232,0.9946,0.06,0.784,0.156,0.9996

**Gary Payton** (in his last season in Seattle) and **Brent Barry** had VORPs of **5.9** and **5.8** respectively with **Rashard Lewis** contributing a **3.2** VORP. Everyone else on the team had a VORP **below 1.0**.

By comparison, the championship Lakers that year, which were extremely top heavy as well, had **Shaq** (**6.1**), **Kobe** (**5.2**), **Horry** (**3.0**). Top heavy, but actually slightly less so than those Sonics. They had players with VORPs above 1.0. The LeBron Heat teams which are another obvious candidate had other contributors with VORPs above 1.0 as well outside their Big 3.

By comparison, this season, only 3 players in the entire league have VORPs above 5.0 - **Jokic** (**9.1**), **Shai** (**8.6**), and **Giannis** (**6.0**). The next closest is **Tatum** at **4.6**.

I looked for teams this year with at least 2 players with a VORP at 3.2 or above and saw these 5:

* Thunder: Shai (8.6), Jalen Williams (3.2)
* Cavaliers: Jarrett Allen (3.5), Evan Mobley (3.3)
* Celtics: Jayson Tatum (4.6), Derrick White (3.3)
* Knicks: Josh Hart (3.4), Karl-Anthony Towns (3.3)
* Bucks: Giannis (6.0), Damian Lillard (3.2)

By the end of the year, the Rockets may have 2 players qualify (Amen Thompson is at 3.1 and Sengun is already at 3.8) and the Cavaliers may have 3 (Mitchell is at 3.1).

Not a single team this year has 3 players with a 3.2 VORP or better though. And every playoff team has contributions with VORPs over 1.0.

  
Does anyone remember this Sonics team? Statistically, they had a better Big 3 than the championship Lakers and the #2 contender Spurs.

this is a good example of a typical playoff-build team, and why they fail. playoff teams need a sixth man kind of player to shake things up when things like injuries happen.

this season to me that team is the warriors. they look good for the last 20 or so games but in the playoffs it is very likely that if they can advance they will start dealing with minor injuries and it doesn't look like they have that Poole type of player like the last time they won. || Was it Vlad Radmanovic with the braids or was it the year after? || I think the '76 Lakers might edge them out with Kareem posting a 9.1 and the entire team going for just 10.2 ('22 Nuggets at 12.4 total).

I am no mathematician and I do not know much about statistics, so I just decided to take some time and find the answer to the easiest question:

*What is the average rank for each All-NBA eligible player across multiple popular advanced metrics this season?*

This was more for my personal curiosity. I do not claim that this method actually has any validity or importance, but I did the work so I thought I would share.

**METHOD:**

*stats collected on 4/3*

To do this I referenced the 8 following advanced metrics that I see commonly used:

EPM, EW, LEBRON WAR(LW), RAPTOR WAR(RW), DARKO DPM(DPM), PER, WS, and VORP

I decided to include both EPM and EW because I think EPM is the best advanced metric so I wanted to give it some extra weight.

In order to compile the list of players best deserving of All-NBA recognition, I first went through each advanced metric for this season and gave each player a tally for an appearance in the top 20 in each of the stats.

I ended up with a list of 23 players who appeared in the top 20 in >3 out of the 8 stats, who are also likely to meet the 65 games played requirement. I had a few players that surprised me, but generally speaking it aligned with my preconceived idea of who was in contention for All-NBA recognition so I decided to roll with it. The only notable omission was Cade Cunningham who appeared in the top 20 in only 2 out of the 8 advanced metrics. Due to his narrative and likelihood of achieving All-NBA recognition, I included him.

Here are the 24 players:

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

Nikola Jokic

Giannis Antetokounmpo (Likely)

Jayson Tatum

Evan Mobley

Donovan Mitchell

Tyrese Haliburton

Ivica Zubac

Stephen Curry (Likely)

Darius Garland

Derrick White

Jarret Allen

Anthony Edwards

Karl-Anthony Towns

Domantas Sabonis (Likely)

Alperen Sengun

James Harden

Jalen Williams

Josh Hart

LeBron James

Tyler Herro

Jaren Jackson Jr.

Jalen Brunson (Likely)

Cade Cunningham

In the following table, I list each player with each of their respective RANKS in each advanced metric. This is not the metric itself, it is just the RANK in which their metric lies in comparison to their peers. 14 in the table means the 14th best number in the league for that respective stat.

At the end of the table, I include two averages. The first average is their average rank across all 8 advanced metrics. The second average (AVG(IMP)) is their average rank across the 5 all around impact metrics (EPM, EW, RAPTOR WAR, LEBRON WAR, and DARKO DPM). I believe these metrics to be different in kind to the others, so I wanted to see their averages separately.

**NOTES**

\-Haliburton being so loved by advanced metrics definitely surprised me given the narrative about him earlier this season. I would be curious to see his metrics if he can put together a full season of consistent play. Advanced metrics understandably love you if you push pace, generate great looks, and rarely turn the ball over.

\-Derrick White being so beloved by advanced metrics was not necessarily surprising, but the fact that it was enough to rank top 15 in this group of players is impressive. He is the epitome of a winning player.

\-While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated. I believe he deserves a lot more love for his performance this season(DPOY anyone?).

\-LeBron, JJJ, Brunson, and Cade not ranking well is definitely not what I expected going into this. Most of the conversation around these players land them in Second Team at worst and I have even heard arguments around these players to claim the 5th First Team spot.

This likely means nothing to most people, but there may be a few sickos who find this interesting.",288,44,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jrdwn9/202425_allnba_teams_based_on_average_ranking/,2025-04-04 10:56:58,"I have long thought Zubac criminally underrated but this HAS to be the most surprising result.  (Looking to see how EW calculated…) || Man Zubac is awesome, eye test tells me he's a great center -- but I still think there is some black box of these stats where they are giving what a center does more weight than other positions. 

Halli is officially super underrated, and Tatum/White, way more than Brown, Jrue, KP, etc. etc. etc. are why Cs had another dominant regular season. (Does your measure like Kornet more than JB? I bet it does.) || [deleted] || Yo this is great. I've idly thought about doing this but was always too lazy, so thanks for the effortpost. I expected LeBron to make 3rd team and also expected Jokic to edge out SGA so that's 2 things I got wrong there.

**Edited** to mention their extremely great health this season has a lot to do with it as they're all eligible for these honors. || I did that a while back and was really surprised how each metrics have their clear bias baked in yet top 4, r guys seem to be all unanimous. Like EPM favors offensive usage, LEBRON favors players that fit well into winning teams, DARKO really favors establish stats, etc. but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context. These metrics are really helpful to find out underrated role players, but for stars, they can be extremely misleading. || It’s crazy that the Cavs best player isn’t even one of the 4 in this analysis  || Very interesting perspective, thank you for sharing!

Zubac is a beast || Interesting stuff. Thanks for gathering this data and breaking it all down. Unfortunately, I think you're right that due to media narrative, there is no chance Brunson and LeBron get left off, and it's likely that Cade and JJJ will make it. Although those guys have all had very good seasons so it's not like it will be a travesty for any one of them to get the nod.

Zubac has almost no chance, as deserving as he is (I've been very impressed with him in the few clippers games I've watched this year) and White and Allen will likely miss the cut. I'd love to see Allen make it. The guy is such a great two way player and he's so unselfish on offense. He really makes the Cavs a much better team. || Jarrett Allen and Ivica Zubac ranking #3 and #4 in win shares is an indictment of that statistic.

> While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated.

I agree with the first part of your statement. But given that reality, why are you then trying to use these insignificant statistics to draw conclusions?

Zubac and Allen have roles to play and they play them well, but role players don't deserve to be ranked ahead of guys like Brunson or Cunningham who have far more difficult burdens to carry. || Why would you base it off metrics nobody uses?

Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil.  They’re useless.  

Obviously this isn’t how the teams are selected.  

Harden hasn’t made an all nba team in 5 years and he’s not going to make one over LeBron, who was the February player of the month and 5th on mvp ladder. || [removed] || Ultimately, the players are very close in a lot of these metrics so one good game or bad game down the stretch could vastly change the calculus for this analysis. 

  
For example, Ant had a good game last night and EW updated so now Ant is up from #10 all the way to #5. This alone would likely push Ant firmly into second team if I were to re run the analysis. But as of 4/3, these were the rankings. || Before Kawhi started playing like Kawhi, I thought Zubac was easily the most important Clipper. And for a team that was projected to be a lottery team to have a shot at 50-wins, that's Hella impressive || PER notoriously overweighs rebounding, so bigs pretty much always have higher PER than guards of similar quality. TBH it's a very flawed advanced stat that shouldnt be included in any analysis including this one imo. || The hate towards him was crazy. The people that were saying that haven't actually watched him play in a meaningful amount. He is the best pure creator in the league, hands down. His three point shooting, while streaky at times, is upper echelon. His defense is improving significantly as he gets more experience. He has moved to being a solidly average defender, when he was often a genuine liability in the past.

He still catches hate from people who like to make similar arguments against him that people do for John Stockton. It's baffling to me that people attempt to make straight faced arguments against these players because they make a high volume of ""easy assists"". You are seriously going to hold it against a player because they are capable of coordinating an offense so effectively, that they are able to very consistently get good shooters open shots, in spots that they shoot particularly well from? That is a testament to their ability as a creator, not a detrimental attribute. || The irony about the ""one good month"" thing is that it's really one bad month that tricked people. He was All-NBA last year and will likely be again this year. He had a bad start to the year but is putting up historically efficient numbers. It's basically him and prime CP3 in terms of this combination of scoring and assist volume + efficiency. Nobody else in NBA history has done this. || It’s the same story around the current MVP debate. For a huge amount of NBA fans, box score is the only value you bring to a team. Offensive output, advanced metrics, film, team success, none of it matters compared to that box score that you can glance at for five seconds and determine how valuable a player is. || The reality is that Allen not being worthy of an all-star this year is mostly a numbers thing, getting four players in is pretty ridiculous given how much talent there is around the league. But having watched most of our games this year, I think it's debatable that he's even our fourth-best player, especially if you consider his defensive impact. He's also the type of player to be underrated by casual/occasional viewers, because he does a lot that doesn't show up on the scoreboard. || >but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context.

Do these metrics underrate these players or are you just over rating them? 

Harden, Herro, and Cade all have good advanced stats. They all carry fairly poor offences || Yes, the biggest reason for this is that none of these stats measure on-ball defensive attention drawn and the benefits that it leads to for other players on the team at the risk of deflating counting stats of the player drawing the attention.

Making open looks as the 3rd/4th option on your team and ending up with a high TS% does not make a player better than say a Cade Cunningham or Donovan Mitchell.

It’s similar to how Ayton had distinctly better advanced numbers than Luka in their rookie seasons along with strong box score numbers at incredible efficiency yet anyone watching knew he was Ayton was a play finisher role player on a fully firing suns team and Luka was the entire Mavs offence. || 2025 is certainly the year of our Lord Tyrone Jerome. || What makes Zubac a role player? He's averaging 17 and 13 playing 33 MPG while anchoring the Clippers' defense. He's contending for the most important player on the team right next to Harden and Kawhi. || > Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil. They’re useless.
> 
> 

Publicly available defensive metrics, absolutely. There's basically zero value in those.

Publicly available overall metrics are solid. The vast majority of basketball value comes from offense and we can measure most of that. It's imperfect, but it's a very good way to determine who's in the ballpark. || My understanding is a lot of these stats weigh a bunch of counting stats heavier for centers than other roles -- which is OK up to a point because maybe a center getting an assist is more valuable than a PG doing the same, but it's hard to know. PER people who know seem to generally perceive as antiquated, right? || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || As someone who doesn't watch much Indiana or Charlotte basketball,  I'm really curious how Haliburton and Ball compare now. And to a lesser extent, Ant.  
Thinking back, man, that was a really fun draft class. || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || It's so weird, he was an all-star and top-tier playmaker an entire year on the Pacers in 22-23 season. His second half of the season in 21-22, when he was traded to the Pacers, was also really really good. His shooting averages have been good his entire career. ""One good month"" people are trolls or need to have their eyes checked because all you need to do is watch 48 minutes of the Pacers and you'll see him constantly trapped and doubled _at the logo_ and instead of playing hero ball he swings it because someone will be open, whether it counts in his box score or not.

But it's no surprise, average basketball fans are really really stupid when it comes to elite playmakers. Jokic was clowned for years and now pretty much everyone recognize how incredible he is. I wonder, what is the difference between now and years before? Ring finger, that's it. || Wouldn't models that include plus/minus stats account for this? Even if you don't necessarily generate an assist or made shot, if your ""gravity"" is actually opening things for teammates and contributing to winning it will show up in the plus/minus.",0.0,0.652,0.348,0.5859,0.032,0.837,0.132,0.9987,0.097,0.711,0.192,0.9997

Let's break down the historical data first.

**Preseason odds**

Basketball reference has [preseason odds](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2025_preseason_odds.html) data going back to 1985. Since then, here are the ""worst"" teams to win a title:

|Year|Champion|Preseason Odds|
:-:|:-:|:-:|
|2015|Golden State Warriors|2800|
|2011|Dallas Mavericks|2000|
|2019|Toronto Raptors|1850|
|2023|Denver Nuggets|1800|
|2004|Detroit Pistons|1500|

Since 1985, 95% of NBA champions had **better than +2000 odds to win the title in the preseason**. 

Looking at just preseason odds would narrow down potential champions to these teams: Boston Celtics, New York Knicks, Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves, Oklahoma City Thunder, Dallas Mavericks, Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers.

**Playoff Seed**

When you look at [every NBA/BAA champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions) dating back to 1947, here is the breakdown by seed:

1 seed- 52 (67%)

2 seed- 16 (21%)

3 seed- 8 (10%)

4/6 seed- 2 (3%)

So 97% of all NBA champions were a **top 3 seed** with the two exceptions being the '69 Celtics and '95 Rockets. 

Looking at just the top 3 seeds would narrow down potential champions to these teams: Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics, New York Knicks, *Los Angeles Lakers*, *Denver Nuggets*, *Los Angeles Clippers*, *Memphis Grizzlies*, *Golden State Warriors*, *Minnesota Timberwolves*

*possible top 3 seed (currently within 2 wins of the 3 seed)*

**All-NBA Defender**

Last metric we are looking at is championship teams with [All-NBA defenders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Defensive_Team). Since the NBA introduced All-Defense teams in 1969, here is every championship team that did NOT have an All-NBA defender:

|Year|Champion|Best Defender|
:-:|:-:|:-:|
|2023|Denver Nuggets|Aaron Gordon|
|2016|Cleveland Cavaliers|LeBron James|
|2006|Miami Heat|Alonzo Mourning*|
|1995|Houston Rockets|Hakeem Olajuwon*|
|1981|Boston Celtics|Robert Parish|
|1978|Washington Bullets|Elvin Hayes|
|1975|Golden State Warriors|Jamaal Wilkes|

*Mourning and Olajuwon were both top 10 in DPOY voting, but missed out on All-Defense due to playing in a stacked position.* 

If we fudge the numbers a bit to say they were All-Defense players, than 91% of all **NBA champions had at least 1 All-Defense player**.

This one is a little harder to predict at this point, but looking at just the players likely to make an All-Defense team would narrow down potential champions to these teams: Golden State Warriors, Cleveland Cavaliers, Oklahoma City Thunder, Atlanta Hawks, Memphis Grizzlies, *Portland Trail Blazers*, *Houston Rockets*, *Boston Celtics*, *Minnesota Timberwolves*, *Miami Heat*, *Los Angeles Clippers*, *Milwaukee Bucks*, *New York Knicks*

*potentially have All-Defense player*

Looking at just these 3 data points (better than +2000 preseason odds, top 3 seed, 1 All-Defense player), I think the potential champions can be broken down into 4 buckets:

**Clear title favorite (meets all 3 criteria)**

Oklahoma City Thunder

**Very strong contenders (meets 2 out of 3, but possibly all 3)**

Boston Celtics, New York Knicks

**Finals contenders, but unlikely to win it all (just 2 out of 3)**

Minnesota Timberwolves, Cleveland Cavaliers, Houston Rockets

**Long shots (meets 1 out of 3, but possibly 2)**

Denver Nuggets, Milwaukee Bucks, Golden State Warriors, Memphis Grizzlies, Los Angeles Clippers",1,42,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jqnb66/oc_narrowing_down_the_true_title_contenders_based/,2025-04-03 12:40:57,"This is a great example of how data can be *misinterpreted and misused.* Which is especially obvious when the conclusion states something like 'The Knicks may meet all 3 criteria and are very strong contenders' but the Cavs are a category below that (because their success was not predicted.) Any conclusion that winds up with 'the Celtics and Knicks are equal contenders' should be reevaluating it's criteria immediately. 


Three seeds have won just 10% of the time, and 1 seeds have won *67%* of the time, yet there is no weighting given between them. You are just using a pass/fail check on being a top 3 seed. 


I'm not really sure what the point of this was.  || Using preseason odds as a metric is so funny because those are an amalgamation of like, potentially hundreds of different factors that Vegas keeps track of. It’s like saying your secret barbecue sauce is store brand barbecue sauce plus mustard and brown sugar. || Shouldn’t you use some sort of metric like defensive rating to measure defense rather than just defensive team appearances? The Bucks have several form All defensive players (including a DPOY) but are a very average defense. The Hawks also make your list but are a very below average defense, and the Magic without an All defensive player are generally a very good defense. 

I also think your use of the pre season odds is silly. Of course teams with higher odds of winning are more likely to win. That’s the whole point of odds, but preseason odds are inherently worse than the current odds because they are missing 70+ games of data. || Not to be rude, but if an analyst I worked with gave me this analysis I’d cringe. 

I think your point on all defensive players is interesting and one I hadn’t heard, but otherwise this analysis is a hot mess. It comes off as someone trying to use quantitative analysis but doesn’t quite understand it. 

That said, I appreciate the creativity and wish there were more posts like this being creative so take my upvote! || IMO, advanced stats (or data in general) is used to spot patterns and bases the patterns to speculate outcomes without the need to review every single data point (watch and analyze all games in the example of the NBA). So, when advanced stats do not fit the eye test, that is a flawed statistic. || Why would you use all defensive team vs all nba team? Are there more teams to win a title with an all defensive team talent than an all nba talent? || the number of teams that fall out of being a preseason favorite are very, very low. so you are just saying they’re favored to win by vegas. same with seeding, very rarely is a team favored to win it all if they arent a top 3 seed.

this whole post is “they’re favored by vegas to win and they have a good defender”

not too informative || Lmao the Knicks aren't very strong finals contenders no matter what 3 data points say || People are being rude for no reason. Interesting approach. Keep trying things. Keep enjoying being a fan || I appreciate the effort but I know it was BS when I saw Knicks beside the Celtics || Stop dude. You posted this in r/nba and no one bought in. Posting it here won't uncringe this. || Bruh, its egregious to expect Clippers, Nuggets, Warriors, Grizzlies to win over the Lakers, who don't even star in your list. That is how we know the data is useless. Like, Lakers are not even in Long Shots category? While holding season record against all of the above teams (I presume we are up against all four). And its not just the playoffs experience that they have, but the eye test confirms it. 

I am sorry my G, this is not very impressive. || [removed] || One thing to note about betting odds… Betting odds aren't based entirely on who the oddsmakers thinks will win; they also account for what will make the oddsmakers the most money while managing risk. For most teams this doesn't change things much. But for the most popular teams which get the most betting activity, the stated odds are often a little skewed. I.e., important to remember oddsmakers are trying to make money more than they're trying to give the best possible prediction of an outcome. 

It also seems weird to use pre-season odds when you could use end-of-season odds. Preseason odds don't account for anything that happens during the season, e.g., injuries, trades, players that don't gel, etc. End of season odds will be based on more data, including pre-season predictions. I'd be shocked if preseason odds are better predictors than end of season. || [removed] || And frankly what's the difference between a 3 seed and a 4 seed anyway you probably are on the road for 3 series anyway. || Yeah, being one of the handful of teams Vegas thinks will win (before the season even starts) isn’t too meaningful of a title. 

Now, is the NBA generally predictable enough to narrow it down to 3-4 teams in preseason? Oh 100% yes, but Vegas can’t anticipate teams like the Knicks failing to win as much as one game against a team that matters. Or teams like Cleveland who no one had any real hope for, finally clicking and being dominant. 

Also, 3 of the 5 examples given were teams that only won because the actual contenders faced massive injuries that year. 

There is some validity to the seeding and the having an All NBA defender, though. || i’m a cavs fan and i’m still a little pessimistic tbh. this team was a dark horse and got punked by the knicks a few years back. struggled with orlando last year. this year is the true test.

the playoffs are about matchups. mitchell is great but he can’t do it all himself. garland needs to deliver and there are obvious defensive holes on the perimeter that will be exploited. || Yeah this is a pretty garbage post for pretty much every point

Preseason odds are just ""was your blueprint for success obvious from the get-go"" (and Cavs probably largely got dinged on odds just because of how heavy of an ECF favorite the Celtics were)

Top-3 seeds should probably be just top 2, if anything.  This is mostly just saying ""if you're good, you're probably at the top of the conference unless something weird is happening"".

And the all-defense point is silly, is there anyone that would realistically argue that the Celtics don't have multiple guys who are all-defense caliber, even they won't happen to land on a team this year?  It's basically just saying ""it's unlikely for a complete glass cannon team to win the title"", which is pretty obvious (and silly to filter on if you have 1 player who got a specific award).

So this post basically boils down to ""if you have an obviously talented team that is decent on defense and plays well during the regular season, you should be a title contender"".  What a revelation! || Ya this forum is just a bunch of nerds trying to play basketball with stats.. the mods won’t let u have an opinion that’s not connected to a stat or analytic and these people never played basketball.

Title contention doesn’t have anything to do with metrics, but metrics can support it. An all world defender means nothing if u have a defensive liability, last year the mavs had a mvp candidate, best interior and perimeter defenders, and a big liability in luca, no matter what metrics u use, they lose because FIVE celtics can exploit that metric easily… || I actually do think there is some value to preseason odds, it just diminishes the further you go into the season. Now would I call them one of the best three predictive stats for the final, of course not. 

But it can be used beneficially. I think it’s reflection (barring any big trades) of how good your roster is on paper. I think it could be useful to compare to current finals odds to gauge the improvement of the team and how the roster actually has performed on paper. But if you see two teams with comparable current odds, I do think there could be an edge in betting on the team with the better opening odds for the season just as they likely have a deeper roster or more experienced roster.

**Gary Payton** (in his last season in Seattle) and **Brent Barry** had VORPs of **5.9** and **5.8** respectively with **Rashard Lewis** contributing a **3.2** VORP. Everyone else on the team had a VORP **below 1.0**.

The LeBron Heat teams which are another obvious candidate had other contributors with VORPs above 1.0 as well outside their Big 3.

By comparison, this season, only 3 players in the entire league have VORPs above 5.0 - **Jokic** (**9.1**), **Shai** (**8.6**), and **Giannis** (**6.0**). The next closest is **Tatum** at **4.6**.

I looked for teams this year with at least 2 players with a VORP at 3.2 or above and saw these 5:

* Thunder: Shai (8.6), Jalen Williams (3.2)
* Cavaliers: Jarrett Allen (3.5), Evan Mobley (3.3)
* Celtics: Jayson Tatum (4.6), Derrick White (3.3)
* Knicks: Josh Hart (3.4), Karl-Anthony Towns (3.3)
* Bucks: Giannis (6.0), Damian Lillard (3.2)

By the end of the year, the Rockets may have 2 players qualify (Amen Thompson is at 3.1 and Sengun is already at 3.8) and the Cavaliers may have 3 (Mitchell is at 3.1).

Not a single team this year has 3 players with a 3.2 VORP or better though. And every playoff team has contributions with VORPs over 1.0.

  
Does anyone remember this Sonics team? Statistically, they had a better Big 3 than the championship Lakers and the #2 contender Spurs. In fact, Payton and Barry seemed to be a better big 2 than both Shaq and Kobe and Duncan and Robinson. But they got little contribution elsewhere outside Rashard Lewis.",50,14,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jrea75/200102_seattle_supersonics_most_top_heavy_playoff/,2025-04-04 11:12:30,"Man, I loved that team.

the reigning champs had the problem that they took too long to transition between the inefficient duncan led offense to a efficient ginobili led offense, parker won the fmvp and wants a larger role but he is simply not good enough. duncan is out of his prime, ginobili has 2 years left, parker has not entered it yet. the team is not constructed for the necessary change, instead they stick with the old players and to stagger the parker minutes they keep bringing ginobili from the bench.

the team looks like this, only 6 regular players average at least 20min

Duncan (31) 34mpg **VORP 4.8** BPM 5.2 **TS% 54**

Parker (25) 33mpg **VORP 2.6** BPM 2.4 **TS% 54**

Finley (34) 26mpg **VORP 0.8** BPM -0.6 TS% 51

Oberto (32) 20mpg **VORP 1.0** BPM 0.4 TS% 61

they finish 56-26 only 1 game behind the 1st seeded Lakers. in the playoffs they reach the WCF but fall to the Lakers 1-4. Ginobili was dealing with an injury that made him lose his speed and elevation the entire run and the old guys could not rise to the level.

this is a good example of a typical playoff-build team, and why they fail. playoff teams need a sixth man kind of player to shake things up when things like injuries happen.

this season to me that team is the warriors. they look good for the last 20 or so games but in the playoffs it is very likely that if they can advance they will start dealing with minor injuries and it doesn't look like they have that Poole type of player like the last time they won. || Was it Vlad Radmanovic with the braids or was it the year after? || I think the '76 Lakers might edge them out with Kareem posting a 9.1 and the entire team going for just 10.2 ('22 Nuggets at 12.4 total).

I am no mathematician and I do not know much about statistics, so I just decided to take some time and find the answer to the easiest question:

*What is the average rank for each All-NBA eligible player across multiple popular advanced metrics this season?*

This was more for my personal curiosity. I do not claim that this method actually has any validity or importance, but I did the work so I thought I would share.

**METHOD:**

*stats collected on 4/3*

To do this I referenced the 8 following advanced metrics that I see commonly used:

EPM, EW, LEBRON WAR(LW), RAPTOR WAR(RW), DARKO DPM(DPM), PER, WS, and VORP

I decided to include both EPM and EW because I think EPM is the best advanced metric so I wanted to give it some extra weight.

In order to compile the list of players best deserving of All-NBA recognition, I first went through each advanced metric for this season and gave each player a tally for an appearance in the top 20 in each of the stats.

I ended up with a list of 23 players who appeared in the top 20 in >3 out of the 8 stats, who are also likely to meet the 65 games played requirement. I had a few players that surprised me, but generally speaking it aligned with my preconceived idea of who was in contention for All-NBA recognition so I decided to roll with it. The only notable omission was Cade Cunningham who appeared in the top 20 in only 2 out of the 8 advanced metrics. Due to his narrative and likelihood of achieving All-NBA recognition, I included him.

Here are the 24 players:

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

Nikola Jokic

Giannis Antetokounmpo (Likely)

Jayson Tatum

Evan Mobley

Donovan Mitchell

Tyrese Haliburton

Ivica Zubac

Stephen Curry (Likely)

Darius Garland

Derrick White

Jarret Allen

Anthony Edwards

Karl-Anthony Towns

Domantas Sabonis (Likely)

Alperen Sengun

James Harden

Jalen Williams

Josh Hart

LeBron James

Tyler Herro

Jaren Jackson Jr.

Jalen Brunson (Likely)

Cade Cunningham

In the following table, I list each player with each of their respective RANKS in each advanced metric. This is not the metric itself, it is just the RANK in which their metric lies in comparison to their peers. 14 in the table means the 14th best number in the league for that respective stat.

At the end of the table, I include two averages. The first average is their average rank across all 8 advanced metrics. The second average (AVG(IMP)) is their average rank across the 5 all around impact metrics (EPM, EW, RAPTOR WAR, LEBRON WAR, and DARKO DPM). I believe these metrics to be different in kind to the others, so I wanted to see their averages separately.

**NOTES**

\-Haliburton being so loved by advanced metrics definitely surprised me given the narrative about him earlier this season. I would be curious to see his metrics if he can put together a full season of consistent play. Advanced metrics understandably love you if you push pace, generate great looks, and rarely turn the ball over.

\-Derrick White being so beloved by advanced metrics was not necessarily surprising, but the fact that it was enough to rank top 15 in this group of players is impressive. He is the epitome of a winning player.

\-While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated. I believe he deserves a lot more love for his performance this season(DPOY anyone?).

\-LeBron, JJJ, Brunson, and Cade not ranking well is definitely not what I expected going into this. Most of the conversation around these players land them in Second Team at worst and I have even heard arguments around these players to claim the 5th First Team spot.

These metrics are really helpful to find out underrated role players, but for stars, they can be extremely misleading. || It’s crazy that the Cavs best player isn’t even one of the 4 in this analysis  || Very interesting perspective, thank you for sharing!

Zubac is a beast || Interesting stuff. Thanks for gathering this data and breaking it all down. Unfortunately, I think you're right that due to media narrative, there is no chance Brunson and LeBron get left off, and it's likely that Cade and JJJ will make it. Although those guys have all had very good seasons so it's not like it will be a travesty for any one of them to get the nod.

Zubac has almost no chance, as deserving as he is (I've been very impressed with him in the few clippers games I've watched this year) and White and Allen will likely miss the cut. I'd love to see Allen make it. The guy is such a great two way player and he's so unselfish on offense. He really makes the Cavs a much better team. || Jarrett Allen and Ivica Zubac ranking #3 and #4 in win shares is an indictment of that statistic.

> While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated.

I agree with the first part of your statement. But given that reality, why are you then trying to use these insignificant statistics to draw conclusions?

Zubac and Allen have roles to play and they play them well, but role players don't deserve to be ranked ahead of guys like Brunson or Cunningham who have far more difficult burdens to carry. || Why would you base it off metrics nobody uses?

Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil.  They’re useless.  

Obviously this isn’t how the teams are selected.  

Harden hasn’t made an all nba team in 5 years and he’s not going to make one over LeBron, who was the February player of the month and 5th on mvp ladder. || [removed] || Ultimately, the players are very close in a lot of these metrics so one good game or bad game down the stretch could vastly change the calculus for this analysis. 

  
For example, Ant had a good game last night and EW updated so now Ant is up from #10 all the way to #5. This alone would likely push Ant firmly into second team if I were to re run the analysis. But as of 4/3, these were the rankings. || Before Kawhi started playing like Kawhi, I thought Zubac was easily the most important Clipper. And for a team that was projected to be a lottery team to have a shot at 50-wins, that's Hella impressive || PER notoriously overweighs rebounding, so bigs pretty much always have higher PER than guards of similar quality. TBH it's a very flawed advanced stat that shouldnt be included in any analysis including this one imo. || The hate towards him was crazy. The people that were saying that haven't actually watched him play in a meaningful amount. He is the best pure creator in the league, hands down. His three point shooting, while streaky at times, is upper echelon. His defense is improving significantly as he gets more experience. He has moved to being a solidly average defender, when he was often a genuine liability in the past.

He still catches hate from people who like to make similar arguments against him that people do for John Stockton. It's baffling to me that people attempt to make straight faced arguments against these players because they make a high volume of ""easy assists"". You are seriously going to hold it against a player because they are capable of coordinating an offense so effectively, that they are able to very consistently get good shooters open shots, in spots that they shoot particularly well from? That is a testament to their ability as a creator, not a detrimental attribute. || The irony about the ""one good month"" thing is that it's really one bad month that tricked people. He was All-NBA last year and will likely be again this year. He had a bad start to the year but is putting up historically efficient numbers. It's basically him and prime CP3 in terms of this combination of scoring and assist volume + efficiency. Nobody else in NBA history has done this. || It’s the same story around the current MVP debate. For a huge amount of NBA fans, box score is the only value you bring to a team. Offensive output, advanced metrics, film, team success, none of it matters compared to that box score that you can glance at for five seconds and determine how valuable a player is. || The reality is that Allen not being worthy of an all-star this year is mostly a numbers thing, getting four players in is pretty ridiculous given how much talent there is around the league. But having watched most of our games this year, I think it's debatable that he's even our fourth-best player, especially if you consider his defensive impact. He's also the type of player to be underrated by casual/occasional viewers, because he does a lot that doesn't show up on the scoreboard. || >but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context.

Do these metrics underrate these players or are you just over rating them? 

Harden, Herro, and Cade all have good advanced stats. They all carry fairly poor offences || Yes, the biggest reason for this is that none of these stats measure on-ball defensive attention drawn and the benefits that it leads to for other players on the team at the risk of deflating counting stats of the player drawing the attention.

Making open looks as the 3rd/4th option on your team and ending up with a high TS% does not make a player better than say a Cade Cunningham or Donovan Mitchell.

It’s similar to how Ayton had distinctly better advanced numbers than Luka in their rookie seasons along with strong box score numbers at incredible efficiency yet anyone watching knew he was Ayton was a play finisher role player on a fully firing suns team and Luka was the entire Mavs offence. || 2025 is certainly the year of our Lord Tyrone Jerome. || What makes Zubac a role player? He's averaging 17 and 13 playing 33 MPG while anchoring the Clippers' defense. He's contending for the most important player on the team right next to Harden and Kawhi. || > Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil. They’re useless.
> 
> 

Publicly available defensive metrics, absolutely. There's basically zero value in those.

Publicly available overall metrics are solid. The vast majority of basketball value comes from offense and we can measure most of that. It's imperfect, but it's a very good way to determine who's in the ballpark. || My understanding is a lot of these stats weigh a bunch of counting stats heavier for centers than other roles -- which is OK up to a point because maybe a center getting an assist is more valuable than a PG doing the same, but it's hard to know. PER people who know seem to generally perceive as antiquated, right? || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || As someone who doesn't watch much Indiana or Charlotte basketball,  I'm really curious how Haliburton and Ball compare now. And to a lesser extent, Ant.  
Thinking back, man, that was a really fun draft class. || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || It's so weird, he was an all-star and top-tier playmaker an entire year on the Pacers in 22-23 season. His second half of the season in 21-22, when he was traded to the Pacers, was also really really good. His shooting averages have been good his entire career. ""One good month"" people are trolls or need to have their eyes checked because all you need to do is watch 48 minutes of the Pacers and you'll see him constantly trapped and doubled _at the logo_ and instead of playing hero ball he swings it because someone will be open, whether it counts in his box score or not.

But it's no surprise, average basketball fans are really really stupid when it comes to elite playmakers. Jokic was clowned for years and now pretty much everyone recognize how incredible he is. I wonder, what is the difference between now and years before? Ring finger, that's it. || Wouldn't models that include plus/minus stats account for this?

He and LeBron could have had several more Finals runs,  in Boston he was intent on big broing JT and JB, and then in Brooklyn talked about how he and KD didn't need a coach, got Kenny Atkinson fired in favor of never-coached-at-any-level Steve Nash.

One of the obvious problems with his play is the extent that he likes to dribble the ball. The prototypical Kyrie possessions is him dribbling the ball 7-8 times at the top, deciding what he wants to do, and then making his move. 

One of the things analytics has taught us is how much value this costs you. Attacking a set defense is harder than attacking one that's scampering around trying to make sure everything's covered. 

You want to know why Curry has so much gravity? Because he might shoot *at any second*. Whereas with Kyrie basically says, ""Hey,  everybody, watch this!"" before he does this thing. And, you know, it IS impressive to watch. But it also means that everybody is on their correct defensive assignment, set and ready when he goes.

Also, you know, people get tired of analytic folks talking about efficiency, but the dirty little secret of Kyrie is that, while he's not *in*efficient, he's not actually super efficient, either. His TS+ for his career is 105. That's a solid, good number, especially for a guy who takes a lot of difficult shots ...

But Curry's is 113. It's elite for a high-volume scorer. He's just better at putting the ball in the basket. Kyrie's best season from an efficiency standpoint was 110, which is worse than Curry's career average. 

(Harden's career average is 110, KD's is 113. You can see that Kyrie is good in this department, but not great.)

The difference on three-point shooting is substantial, as you probably know. Curry is .423% on almost ten a game. Kyrie is .394 on six a game. 

But it's not just three-point shooting. This one always surprises people, but Curry is more efficient at shooting near the basket, too: .652 career vs. Kyrie's .626 fg% inside of three feet. This feels like it *can't* be true, because Kyrie's got this crazy array of circus moves. But that gets to the dichotomy I spoke to above: are you evaluating what a player CAN do, or how much they help you win? Kyrie can absolutely make a wider array of crazy shots near the basket than Curry (although Curry has closed the gap considerably in the past five years) - but it turns out the crazy shots don't actually count for more points. Kyrie's greater number of highlight plays at the rim are counterbalanced by more misses. || I think there are a few things.

First, the difference in shooting skill. Obviously you do agree with this, but I think it should be pointed out that Curry has taken 50% more threes than Kyrie on 3% higher efficiency over their careers. Steph is simply on another level, with his ability to take and make tough shots being far greater than Kyrie's.

Second, I wouldn't understate Curry's playmaking ability. We saw him thrive in a traditional PG-centric offense under Mark Jackson in 2014, where he averaged just short of 9 assists per game. Furthermore, the off ball gravity and attention he commands opens up immense opportunities for his teammates. Everyone intuitively knows this, but I think to really understand it one absolutely needs to watch some film analysis videos on how two defenders stay locked onto Steph during an off ball screen action, opening up the paint for his teammate to cut, or how the mere threat of Curry breaking free momentarily freezes a defender such that a shooter is left open in the corner. In terms of playmaking, they are night and day; even though Steph does most of his playmaking off the ball, he still has great assist numbers.

You made a point about finishing as well. Here, I would posit that the gulf isn't as large as people would traditionally think it to be - obviously Kyrie takes a higher volume of shots, and has an incredibly wide arsenal of layups he can utilize, but Curry is incredibly efficient at the rim (historically so during his younger days when he was more athletic) due to the unique opportunities his three point shot creates, without needing to be as flashy.

Finally, I think there's also the aspect of leadership. Kyrie is, in many ways, a pure ""hooper"" (and this is not in a derogatory manner, he is an amazing player). He gets his buckets, yes, but beyond that, Curry is uniquely able to lead a team, inspire, and do what it takes to win even at the cost of himself. I mean, just take a look at Kyrie's antics in Brooklyn or in Boston, he has never really been able to take a team to that next level on his own.

For these reasons, Kyrie's career hasn't panned out like Steph's -- he is simply less able to elevate both oneself and others to the same degree. || I think it's a couple of things and winning is the most obvious one. Curry is a proven winner. There just isn't any way to get around that. I'm not even a ""RINGS"" guy but I think it is very relevant. 

I think Kyrie's antics and lack of leadership are bigger deals, though. It seems like he can never stay settled. I'm not saying he doesn't deserve to determine his career path, but it seems like it has gotten in the way more than it has been helpful. 

Kyrie is also way less impactful when the ball isn't in his hands. Curry is the GOAT shooter, but even more importantly he affects the game massively when the ball isn't in his hands.

The streets will never forget Kyrie but I think had he won even one more finals he would be held much higher than he is now. || Steph's most elite ability (Shooting 3s at an insane clip) is a literal league-changing ability. He's changed basketball fundamentally, which, since it came at a time when nobody was doing it, caught the league by surprise and allowed for a dynasty run. Kyrie's elite ability (Amazing ball-handling), while incredible, hasn't been able to elevate his team's game.   
  
He's an incredible 1-on-1 player, but Steph's game elevated the whole franchise, Kyrie's elevated himself. It's the reason he didn't do much of anything for years before Lebron came back to the team, even though he was scoring well individually. 

I actually feel like if Kyrie had been LESS of a scorer and more of a facilitator with an unreal handles bag, he might have been more valuable over the course of his career so far. Imagine a taller Chris Paul with Kyrie's handle, or a more athletic Nash with a flashier handle.

This isn't to say Kyrie has had a bad career, but Steph's shooting just had/has way more top-end value than what Kyrie brings to the table, and that's before you get into leadership and other less tangible things. || 3 reasons.  

1: Seeing basketball in terms of 1v1 instead of 5v5.  Irving doesn't have as much of a focus on creating great team looks compared to creating shots he can hit.  This is why he's best next to guys like LeBron & Luka who are genius level at creating great looks for teammates.  Watch for what players are willing and good screen setters and the enthusiasm they make decoy cuts, there is a strong correlation between how hard players play on actions not designed to get them the ball and how much they view the game as a 5v5 game.  Offensive geniuses like Harden and Luka often fail this test.  Hustle guys like Westbrook often fail this test.  But ""selfish"" guys like Kobe can pass this test.  (In Harden's defense, he dials up his off ball game when he had a lower offensive load, so he and Luka likely have the 5v5 mindset, but pick their moments rather than making it a consistent part of their game).  

2: Over reliance on tough shot making.  Sure, Irving can beat anyone 1v1, and hit crazy hard finishes over help defenders or midrange jumpers, but a contested layup from a 6'2"" guard or a midrange jumper from a great shooter still brings lower expected points per shot than a role player taking a open 3 or a big finishing a shot under the rim.  Being able to hit tough shots has its value, but it's has less value than being able to generate easy shots for themselves and/or teammates.  

3: an incomplete understanding of talent by nba observers.  We see guys like Jokic & Steph, and think they over achieve, because we don't have good ways to quantity the advantages they get from endurance, balance, core strength, and crazy coordination, yet we are extra aware of their athletic weaknesses.  But when other players struggle with stamina, we project it as them being lazy and undisciplined rather than acknowledging that almost no players can develop Steph like endurance, even if it was their goal.  Irving has done a ton to maximize his game, but Steph has another level of conditioning that most players can never reach. || Curry is on a completely different stratosphere as a shooter and that opens up the rest of his game. Steph also has superhuman conditioning so he runs around off-ball the entire game in a way no one can. Those two allow Steph to just be a better shot creator and be more efficient. || You cannot exaggerate how great Steoh shooting is let's consider the greats that made themselves on one specific style of three form shooting James Harden off the dribble,  catch and shoot with Klay, movement shooting Reggie Miller, absurd long range Dame all of these guys who are a super star at this specific style.

Steph Cyrry has better numbers than all of them in their specialty. Hus MVP he was shooting at an efficency rate that is comparible to Shaq and Dwight Howard. He is shooting farther than everybody and his efficency can only be matched by those who shot the closest.

I don't think there is a single player other than Steph that has a skill that is set apart so far from anyone else in history.

Now the issue with Kyrie is because he isn't steph level shooting to be this high scoring player you then need to get to the free throw line something he doesn't do because he avoids contact. || People mentioning stuff like stamina, gravity, better shooting ability, etc. all of which may be true, but I think what fundamentally sets Curry apart from him is his basketball IQ. Basketball IQ is what separates superstar players and superstar winners. Curry is one of the smartest players ever in understanding how to use his skills to impact winning. 

In addition to Kyrie, you can apply this to Dame Lillard and James Harden as well. All 3 of them are 3 of the most skilled players ever. They are all some of the top shooters of all time, they all have top 10 handles ever, and unlike curry all of those guys are very explosive athletes. So you would think those guys should be able to do what Curry does right? 

But there is a reason that their elite shooting, elite dribbling, elite scoring, elite athleticism, does not lead to winning the way it does for Curry. Because those guys don’t see all the small non flashy nuances that lead to winning. Like when to set a perfect screen. Or when to move into an open spot without the ball. Or when to just make the swing pass and keep the ball moving. All the stuff that leads to winning basketball that they 100% have the ability to do, but just isn’t how they see the game. || [removed] || [removed] || 
Some shooters you close out on, but don't guard them as tightly cause they have a slow release + low 3pt percentage when closing out. 

Some shooters you have to stick to like glue because they can fire it off the second it gets in their hands, and you need to close out or run them off the line

Some shooters you have to stick to like glue, but they run around the court 30+ minutes per game, and causes so much miscommunication that he draws double teams 20 feet away from the basket, whether on purpose or not.

Guess which one Steph is, and guess which one is the most impactful. || Kyrie wanted to be a leader of a team but he is just not  a leader. That is why he did well wirh Lebron and failed wjth thr Celtics and the Nets. Then did well again with Luka next to him. || Kyrie has improved as a playmaker in his later years, but I just don’t think he’s ever been as inclined to set people up to score as Steph is.   I think people forget that before Draymond came into his own, Steph was averaging 8+ assists a game.  Like I think Steph really could’ve averaged like 27 points and 8 assists throughout his prime, but he transitioned into more of an off ball role for the sake of the team.  Draymond is much more effective when Steph plays off ball.

Then Kyrie just isn’t quite the same shooter Steph is, even though he’s still one of the best ever.  Kyrie never got into habit of shooting those really deep 3’s like Steph and Dame do.  He’s not really a threat until he’s a foot or two behind the line. Plus Kyrie never shot as many 3’s as Steph and typically doesn’t shoot them as efficiently.  So yeah he’s “almost” as efficient as Steph but it’s on like 5 fewer attempts a game and he’s taking most of his shots from right behind the line instead of taking them from 28+ feet. Steph makes defenses freak out so much because he’s  a threat from so far away.  Kyrie isn’t gonna be left open, but he’s also not making defenses bend to guard him like Steph does.  Kyrie’s crazy mid range scoring is great, but it doesn’t open up as many scoring opportunities as Steph’s style does. 

Also, Kyrie is great at attacking the paint but he never really sought out contact.  Like I’m pretty sure he averages fewer free throw attempts than Steph, in spite of being perceived as the more physical player. || Stef Curry is the greatest shooter the league has ever seen.  It's a skill beyond ""elite"", he's literally the greatest at it, in an era where shooting is much more impactful and important.  Additionally, his off-ball movement and ability to get shots off in fractions of a second with minimal space are what takes his offensive impact to another level compared to other all-time shooters like Allen, or Nash, or Miller, or Bird, etc.  He warps the defensive game plan so much that it opens up high-quality opportunities all over the floor as the defense needs to slant in his direction so much...and with all his off ball movement, that slant is constantly having to adjust all over the floor, which is nigh impossible to do.  Stef Curry is one of the greatest *offensive* players of all time, right up there with Wilt, Magic, Jokic, etc.

Kyrie Irving doesn't approach that level of impact in any way.  His best skills are ballhandling and iso scoring.  Both those skills, independent of high level playmaking skills, are only very impactful in certain circumstances - say with another high level playmaker, for instance LeBron or Luka.  While Curry's impact affects his entire offensive side, making offense easier for his entire team, Kyrie's impact is only getting his own shot off.  People might not like this comparison, but I feel like Kyrie's impact is along the lines of a player like Joe Johnson - a walking bucket to be sure, but not a player who makes other players better by making the game easier for them.

Stef Curry is in another stratosphere from what Kyrie Irving brings, and Kyrie simply never had any shot of having a career like Stef's because he is a different, and vastly inferior player. || He’s just not nearly as good as Curry.  He is better suited to being a score-first second option, he lacks elite playmaking for a PG, he isn’t much of a defender, his shot selection can be questionable, obviously a great player and a unique talent but a team with kyrie as the #1 option is going nowhere || Kyrie is awesome and is a joy to watch, but he is just not better in 5 on 5 organized basketball. Curry's game impact overshadows him in almost every aspect. It's not really close by any metric, unless you really value ""hooper"" players. || I think it's just as simple as Curry is better.  Kyrie is probably the best ball handler of all time, but outside of that there's really no conversation.  He might do different things better than Curry does, but Curry is MUCH better at his things than Kyrie is at his. Trying to put Kyrie into the Steph conversation, even if it's framed as ""why did he never get as good as him"", is kind of a forced conversation.  Kyrie is one of the best players in the league on any given night, but in terms of guys he should be talked alongside with, he's closer to Devin Booker than he is Steph Curry.  Kyrie has also never been the #1 guy on a team that has won it all, or has had sustained success. || Kyrie is self-centered, selfish and cantankerous.  Steph is laid back, rational and much more of a team player. || [removed] || You do realize playmaking isn’t just an assist numbers thing right ? Kyrie simply just doesn’t have the gravity that Steph has . Steph makes everyone around him better while Kyrie just doesn’t provide that same type of gravity or space. || His antisemitic comment because when you go up against the owners, it doesn’t play very well, especially one who was as well known as Mark Cuban when you make certain comments, you kill a career || I think Steph is so great at shooting that people tend to overlook how great he is at everything else. They just see him as a 3pt machine. His handles are elite, I'd say Kyrie is really the only one better than him, and it's not that big of a gap. His play making is wildly underrated as well, his BBIQ is way way ahead of guys like kyrie. His conditioning is on another level, his off ball game is insane. He runs around more than anyone else, even at his age now. Really the only thing he isn't elite at is defense, and his defense got better over time. Kyrie has great handles and is more athletic(explosive), but that's all he has on Steph. || Kyrie is most definitely not as good as Curry, and that's the main reason.  Otherwise, Kyrie's teams weren't as successful as Curry's teams mostly because the Warriors have had more defense (Draymond, Iguodala, even Klay), they developed more chemistry through keeping the same core together for a long time (Kyrie has changed teams a couple of times), and the Warriors system / the way that Curry fits into the system by running cuts.  Kyrie has played on a squad with Harden and Durant... and none of them got an All-Defensive selection.  People keep overlooking the fact that teams who play defense are more successful.  The Nuggets are one of the only championship teams in decades that didn't have great defense.

And Kyrie's anti-vaxxing position also disrupted his career and value as an asset at one point. || Warriors being intentional about the team construction and culture and being consistent with it for a decade plus || Most people hit the major points: 3pt shooting and leadership.

I want to add defense though. Curry took is seriously and turned himself into a decent to good team defender. He was never going to be a great 1 on 1 guy but he took is seriously.

Even in Kyries better seasons, he was never a good 1 on 1 or team defender. || It's probably not just one thing, but a bunch of things that, when you aggregate them, explain the separation. That said, I susoect the reason is the mental difference between the two -- from the outside, it appears enormous. 


(1) Talent. This is sort of obvious, but Kyrie's big advantage over other guards is his handle and shotmaking. Curry largely negates those advantages by being a comparable ballhandler and a slightly better finisher at the rim. When you also add that Steph is a better shooter outside the arc, with higher pts/rebounds/assists per 100, higher true shooting %, has vastly superior on-floor vs. off-floor +/- to Kyrie, and is a better defender than Kyrie, it starts to make a lot of sense why Steph has had the better career and is considered the better player and has won more.


(2) Injuries/luck. Luck also plays a role in the form of injuries. Steph had bad ankles early, but Kyrie's body has been chronically a problem for him his entire career. Even when playing well, he gets hurt more easily. This has clearly held him and his teams back vis-a-vis Steph, who figured out a workaround for his ankles with shoes specifically designed for him via UA. 


Funny enough, each of them won their first titles in large part due to injuries to the other. 


(3) Mental. Kyrie has historically been a self-absorbed headcase by those around him. Early in his career he was commonly derided as ""selfish, weak-spirited, and overrated,""  and there is a laundry list of self-indulgent and sometimes bizarre behavior from Kyrie. Vax, flat earth, anti-semitism, demanding trades in Cleveland and Brooklyn (leaving LeBron and KD, respectively), getting coaches fired, publicly calling out teammates in Boston, just a lot of diva bullshit. 


What's the most diva shit Steph has done? Throw a mouthpiece? Steph wants to win, even if it hurts his touches, his ego doesn't seem to rate compared to winning. If Butler had come in and started averaging 30, Steph would've figured out how to work around it and fit in. Winning is what he is about.


Kyrie is more complicated. He has been a locker room cancer at times. He is def capable of speaking out about his touches when his team is winning if he's not scoring enough. He wants to win, obviously, but he wants to win his way. He wants a full share of the glory, not to be known as LeBrin's sidekick. 


All this shit just adds up. There's just no one category that Kyrie is better than steph in a meaningful way, save maybe TOV (3.6 v. 4.4). And then you add the mental, that's the real difference IMO. || The biggest difference is off ball ability.  Kyrie might be in the same realm as Steph in terms of 1:1 basketball or defensively, but when it comes to Steph off the ball, he’s an alien the way he breaks defenses, thanks to his insane release point/variance. || You mentioned it and it cannot be overstated. Curry isn't just an elite shooter; he's THE gravitational force. Defenses are terrified of Curry anywhere past half-court, with or without the ball. This forces constant double teams, traps, and defenders sticking to him far away from the basket, creating acres of space (4-on-3 situations) for his teammates.

Kyrie is an elite shooter and scorer. However, defenses don't guard him 35 feet from the basket or panic quite as much when he doesn't have the ball. His threat is primarily on-ball. Curry's threat is constant, on and off the ball. This difference in how they stress a defense is massive for team offense.",0.0,0.828,0.172,0.3612,0.094,0.706,0.2,0.9716,0.069,0.745,0.186,1.0
LeBron James,"""Lebron James"" OR ""King James"" OR ""Bron"" OR ""Lebron"" OR ""Bron Bron"" OR ""LBJ""",2025-04-09,nbadiscussion,1jw1eff,Do you believe a FMVP should go to the loser if he has actually been the best performing player?,"The discussion sparked by reading those annual social media comments about Iguodala not deserving FMVP and *only* holding LeBron to 35/13/9? Many comments were saying it was better to just award LeBron James the award because he was far and away the best performing player that series. Or I've seen comments saying to give it to Stephen Curry because he was the best, statistically, performing player on the winning team.  
 
So, for one, that narrative of ""holding Lebron to only 35/13/9"" is very deceiving. Going by [ESPN's stats](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2015/6/22/8814633/andre-iguodala-justifying-the-most-valuable-player-nba-finals-2015), Iguodala held LeBron James to 33% shooting when he was his primary defender. The Cavaliers often tried to switch Iguodala off but only succeeded 20% of the time meaning the Warriors were not allowing LeBron to force a switch to a smaller player.  Also by going through [more detailed stats](https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/106613/iggy-makes-lebrons-shooting-iffy), we see that Iguodala was not giving him any looks, allowing any switches and defending as best as one realistically can. I know it's also a team effort because no one man can stop any elite offensive superstar.  
  
With that said, Iguodala went on to receive 7 out of the 11 FMVP votes and LeBron received 4. Even with as well as LeBron was defended in Iguodala minutes, overall, he still did average absurd numbers and had a huge impact in a series than ended in 6. Should performances like this be applauded and rewarded despite it not leading to a win? Or should we reserve FMVP solely to a player on the winning team?",645,428,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jw1eff/do_you_believe_a_fmvp_should_go_to_the_loser_if/,2025-04-10 11:58:40,"I think if the player on the losing team is good enough, he should win.

Lebron in 2015 is the only series in my lifetime where I would have been fine with that outcome.

That being said, Iggy winning it is absurd. Steph was significantly more impactful and more productive. It was a narrative award because the warriors turned the series around when Iggy went into the starting lineup. I’m sure that helped, but the Cavs radically changed styles after losing Kyrie and the warriors were going to adjust to it anyways. || It has to go to close 7 and have a one man team vs a team like 2004 Pistons. If you take those Lebron stats and his team, and put them over there it would’ve been real hard to give FMVP to Chauncey. Or Rip, Ben or Sheed. Lebron would be getting that award i’m sure. || No. I believe the testimony of Jerry West, and he lacked words to express how inappropriate it felt. Toward his team mates. In regards to his own feelings, which are concerned with losing.

Some FMVPs are more legendary than others. Jerry West's is for the dramaturgy of that first occurrence. Repeating that mistake would be plain stupid, imho.

As for Iggy's MVP, no shade to Iggy, but the mistake was really taking it from Steph.

Last year Brown the MVP and it was somewhat ok because although Tatum is the best player in the team, the performance in the series was comparable and Tatum isn't a cornerstone like Curry was. The team has spacing, playmaking, defense, etc. Without him.

Without Curry, the playmaking was ok but ugly, but the difference in spacing was huge. It was a mistake to award an X factor instead of a cornerstone.

The level of a player is best assessed by the standard you judge him by. If you judge players by different standards, then the players whose standard is the highest should gets the award, period, unless the performance literally changes the way you see both players. An underperforming Curry was still way more instrumental to winning than an overperforming Iggy. And that's no shade to Iggy. There was a huge gap between Scalabrine and a college player. There was  a big gap between a top 80 player in the league then (what Iggy was ?) and Scalabrine (~400th ?). And again a big gap between a top 3 player (Curry) and Iggy. || [removed] || This happened just last year in the NHL. McDavid won it even though the Oilers lost the series. Obviously they're very different sports, but I don't think it's controversial at all to think the FMVP could still be on the losing side. || I get what the argument is for it, but I'm fine with restricting it to the winning team. It's kind of a similar thing to the MVP award - it almost always goes to someone from a good team. A player on a non-playoff team, for instance, will not win the award even if they had gaudy stats.

This is kind of the same thing. You could essentially ask, ""How valuable was your performance, if your team lost?"" I suppose you could argue that the team would have lost by a bigger margin, but a loss is still a loss. Having it be someone from the winning side makes sense, as it is basically saying that their contribution was essential to the win.

Jerry West is the only player to win FMVP while losing, but that was in the first year that they did the award. Since then, it's always gone to the winner. || Depends on the disparity between the best player on the winning team and the best player on the losing team, as well as the series itself

It’s easily to put up high numbers in a losing effort than it is on a winning effort:

•If the losing team never actually stood that much of a chance then no, the best player on that team shouldn’t get it

•If the losing team stood a chance but the best player on the losing team barely outplayed the best player on the winning team, then no, the loser shouldn’t get it

•If the losing team stood a chance and the best player on the losing team far outplayed the best player on the winning team, then yes, the loser should get it || What is the intended outcome of playing in the finals? It’s to win the finals, of course. 

If that’s the case, then the most *valuable* player should be the one who contributed the most to the winning team meeting its objective. 

This may leave a bad taste in people’s mouths for a variety of reasons, but that’s just how it’s generally been accepted to be. || No, FMVP should go to a player on the winning team. I view the award as which player made the largest impact for the winning team. I think an amazing performance by a player on the losing team should be remembered, but what exactly is the value if it results in a loss? I don’t even think a player on the losing team would be remotely interested in winning that award. || Yes, to a small extent.  LeBron was 1 vote away from winning the 2015 Finals MVP (initial votes were LeBron: 4, Iggy: 4, Steph: 3, then the Steph votes consolidated to Iguodala).

If the Cavs lost in Game 7 LeBron would’ve won the award as Draymond was the Warriors leading candidate and he missed a game, while LeBron led the series in every stat category.

The Told Larry Bird that he would’ve won in 1984 even if the Celtics had lost game 7. 

And Jerry West won in 1969, and I think a lot of people believe this was due to there not being a precedent, but I believe if that series happened again today, that West still would’ve won the award due to his dominance.

 So if it’s close, it should always go to the winner, but when the series is close and the individuals are not, it should be able to go to a player on the losing side. || Yes. Think about the regular season MVP award. The vast majority of people oppose the idea of just giving it to the best player on the team with the best record. It should go to the player who has the best performance throughout the series, even if that player's team doesn't win the series. || I think it should be possible but exceedingly rare.

Anytime any ""MVP"" conversation comes up of any kind it all comes down to what the individual person means when they say ""valuable"". Like what is their definition of ""value""/""valuable"" because it's clearly not the same for everyone. Could actually be pretty easily resolved by changing MVP award names to something more descriptive and specific but protracted debates about things like MVP are super useful to the league(s) so no incentive to change it. || If you take away the most valuable player from a losing team, they still lose. || [removed] || The best player means the best player and I'm not sure why this is such a controversial issue in American sports.  Diego Forlan won the golden ball in SA 2010 and Messi won it in Qatar; the latter also won the world cup and the former did not. It's really not that complicated but inertia and some informal rule means people get irrationally upset at recognising the best player outright. || Yeah why not

Lebron outplayed everyone on the Warriors when Igoudala won FMVP but they didn’t want to give it to the loser so Igoudala became the guy by default 

It damaged Steph’s resume to lose FMVP to a role player more than it would have to lose it to Lebron who was carrying the Cavs with no Kyrie or KLove || No, absolutely not.

The entire purpose of professional sports is to win and your *value* as a player is determined by your ability to help that team win. It doesn't matter how good your stats are, if your team doesn't win you are less valuable than a player with lesser stats.

I just don't understand the other side of this. How can you be most *valuable* if you lose? It's the Most Valuable Player award, not the Best Player award.

I get that Lebron is a far better player than Iggy, and individually had much better numbers. But in that series Iggy was more valuable to his team than Lebon was to his because he helped his team win and Lebron didn't. || It makes 100% sense that a player on a losing team could get the finals MVP but sports Journos have the simplest reading of things. There are seemingly endless examples of the ""best"" player not being rewarded for their accomplishments and impact on the field. This happens all the time with Heisman Trophy and the NFL MVP. I would love for a player on a losing team to win the award. We should be able to appreciate and recognize incredible performances even if they don't win. Granted, if you get swept/blown out, you likely won't be considered, but dragging a lesser team to a game 6 or 7 and losing close could certainly result in a FMVP, IMO. || Yes, it should be allowed, but only the narrowest of possible circumstances could justify it. The winning team would have to be a real ensemble with no obviously critical player. The Finals would have to go seven games, with the losing team BARELY not winning the title. And the losing team’s best player would have to put up a historically-dominant performance, so great that it doesn’t even seem debatable. 

No such example has happened in the last fifty years and it seems unlikely to happen. But I think that it should definitely be allowed. || Fine with it but the qualifiers would be pretty strict. Needs to be a 6 or 7 game series, and the player needs to have an all-time level performance head and shoulders above anyone on the winning team. 

A 4 or 5 game series I’d say I never would consider it. And if it goes 6 or 7 but someone on the winning team has a great performance of their own then they deserve it. || No. Someone might technically have been more valuable on the losing team, but giving it to them is some sort of cruel participation trophy.

""Hey you're crying over there in your locker room (or should be) but come out here for this award.""

That player values goes to zero once the team loses. Because if that player got injured right before the series, his team still loses. It is what it is. || Not as obvious but I think Kawhi largely won his first FMVP because he defended LeBron rather than Kawhi being the best player in the finals. Lebron was probably the best player in both those series. I get why the award basically always goes to someone on the winning team but I don't think I agree with the logic. || No. 

The ultimate value is in winning. 

Unless we want sport to be qualitative instead of quantitative. 

In which case, just award the chip to the team we ‘think’ is the best. Not the team that won. || Shoulda just been named as Playoffs MVP. With half points from playoffs and the other from Finals || This is purely anecdotal and I haven't looked at the numbers in totality. But, I did remember watching the actual game. LeBron scores a lot of garbage time points in losing games and not really impacting the chances of winning by a meaningful amount. The defense isn't actively trying to prevent him from scoring without fouling. I remember one of the games he was around 25 pts, and by the end of it scored in the mid-30's in a losing effort. || FMVP should just not exist as a real award. It's no more than those Player of the Game ""awards"" given out after every televised game. There's no real vetting process. || Who would win FMVP? Lakers vs Celtics

The Celtics have a balanced attack and win the series in 6 games. Luka delivers a dominant performance but the Lakers lose with limited contributions from the rest of the team.

JB averages 18/8/3

It’s fair to say OKC didn’t really have that with multiple injuries to Kd, ibaka, Russ through their Contending cycle. Also, you could bring up the 2021 nets, probably kds last superstar year where he could be the best player in a playoff series against another mvp. 

If a player like Kd is leading his team to 6 straight 55-60 win caliber seasons as the lead option, leading a top 25 regular season team ever (2013 okc), being the clear cut best player against teams like the dynasty spurs, outplaying Kawhi in his prime, battling LeBron to a standstill in the 2012 finals , etc, why is that not enough to prove he can win as a clear cut #1 to large portions nba fans? 

I feel like a large portion of NBA fans are slaves to binary thinking, that if you don’t win you’re in a pool with players that haven’t won even if you reached the brink, (like putting Melo and Kevin the same bucket).    

Success in the nba is a spectrum, not a simple yes or no success checkbox. 

In short: kds proven he can lead a team to the brink, all that was missing was the last piece of the puzzle, but that last piece of the puzzle is injury luck and timing, not really about kds ability to win as a #1. 

I think the best 3 level  scorer ever, versatile/switchable defender that can creates a lot of advantages for teammates with his scoring gravity, can easily be the best player on a chip logically, even without really looking at his resume.  I think people for some reason ignore anything he did from 2011-2016 and over index on post Achilles years  ",183,358,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jwjga4/revisionism_around_durants_ability_to_win_as_a/,2025-04-11 02:36:38,"The reason he gets criticism on that front is because he’s justifiably being graded on a curve. He’s got the box-score statistical footprint of a Top 10-15 player. I think it’s fair to nit-pick some of his relative failings because we’re not comparing him to an average player. || I would just say that ""*winning*"" requires a lot of factors to align, from personal skills, team related ones, mental readiness and luck, that said, Kevin Durant said himself that he was aiming to be the best player ever, he just never was.

If we're talking about every aspect that makes a player a winner, Durant kinda fell short as a superpower, the choices he made didn't pay off and I believe that the way a player manages his career is relevant to judge them.

Signing to the Nets while he was injured to partner with Kyrie was a bad move, teaming with Curry was a very controversial one, choosing Booker and the Suns to win also was shortsighted.

He is very skilled but he doesn't seem ""wise"" regarding the way he personally managed his career. || KD in his prime outplayed Kawhi but Kawhi in his prime out played KD. KD played almost as good as LeBron in 2012 but he wasn't required to do as much and it was easier because he was on the best team ever. I don't know anybody who says Melo was as good as Durant. The year he got the Thunder to the Finals the team was healthy and they still lost. He was the second most important player on the Warriors when he did win. Everybody has KD as one of the top 25 players of all time and most have him in that 10-15 range. He is not as good as LeBron or Curry who dominated most of his prime. You just love to rage and this is what you chose to be upset about today. || Another thing that impacts people’s ability to see KD as the lead guy has been his lack of putting up shots, I think he has under 10 games with 50+ points and his career high is 55. Obviously he’s extremely efficient, but it feels like it may be to a fault. I think most fans want to see their number 1 guy give it their all regardless of their stats, and there’s definitely glimpses of KD doing that, but it’s not routine. As in, you want the eye test to show that your #1 guy is dragging the team to victory. I think that’s another explanation for why the narrative sticks with KD that he can’t lead || The reason KD isn’t seen as a championship level #1 is because he didn’t win a championship as the #1 player.  He joined Steph Curry’s team as a supercharged #2.  The Warriors won before he got there, and won again after he left.

It’s really no different than why someone like Scottie Pippen isn’t seen as a championship level #1 despite having the talent and despite leading the Bulls to 55 wins when MJ retired.

If it makes you feel better, KD is also in the same group as other league MVPs - Charles Barkley, for example. || I'd say that KD's biggest issues are off the court. He's made bad team decisions and is also a passive participant. I can't remember who said it but your team will struggle to win if your best player not only isn't a leader, but also isn't a follower either. This applies to KD.

Also, if OKC just don't trade Harden, they likely win at least 1, and if one of Westbrook, Ibaka and KD don't get injured each year between 2013 - 2015 they likely have a shot too. || Look, it’s not about what he *could* have done—it’s about what he *didn’t* do. He never proved himself, and that’s on him. We all know why: Durant has a reserved personality. He’s not vocal, he doesn’t take command, and he defers in big moments. That pretty much explains everything. || Most of this sub never played ball at a remotely competitive level and have zero idea of how to actually judge a player.  Hell anyone that even played AAU and high school varsity has a basic understanding that the championship team even in the local league rarely has the best if even close to the best players.

I mean even in KD advanced age this season his team went 2-16 while KD was out, and 33-29 while he was in.  People just have no clue what it’s like to be a top player on a horrible team. || Why can't KD be thought of as good enough to win as the lead-option? Because he never did so. Part of it his own fault, other parts of it are just simply because he's a bit overrated.



Durant is a good player, even a great one, but he isn't a true all-time great. His game isn't highly dominant, it relies on mostly his height to simply shoot over defenders who are ""late"" on adjustments. It's why he was perfect for GS because they had multiple players who can create their own offense, or could create offense for others and could pass. You add KD to that mix, and suddenly his height and mediocre dribbling ability are seemingly unstoppable. But you take him out of that mix, and KD is just another high volume offensive playmaker. At least, that's what I think.



There's also the matter of his weak mental strength. Or maybe, the fact that he's sort of a flake. This is gonna come off as biased, because I'm a huge westbrook fan; but the one time KD had a chance to really prove his talents and win a title with true merit was in 2016. But, and maybe i'm wrong, he didn't want to share the spotlight with Russell Westbrook and so he quit on the team in 2016 and bounced shortly afterwards to GS. Look at KD""s stats in game 6; he missed 21 shots. KD was a complete ghost in that game, and even Charles Barkley at halftime flat-out said ""if the Thunder lose this game, it's because of Kevin Durant."" This game, as a huge westbrook fan, has always bugged me. It's the best chance Westbrook would ever have to win a ring, and Kevin Durant not only faltered, he in my opinion threw the game on purpose. Why? I'm not sure. Maybe he disliked Westbrook and didn't want to share the spotlight; maybe he was scared of facing Lebron james in the finals and thought he'd get embarassed; maybe he felt that his time in OKC was up and he just wanted to go to GS right away. I'm not sure what happened, but KD played the worst game of his career, and imo it was done on purpose.



Or he didn't lose that game on purpose, and he simply is not as good as you and, to a lesser extent, I think he is. Either way him missing 21 shots in game 6 shows the weak minded will to win he truly possesses. If you wanted him to prove that he could win a title as the first option, then him closing game 6 at OKC and winning the finals that year would've been the year he could've shut up his critics for good. Instead he straight up threw game 6 and then took the easy shortcut for a ring right afterwards. So even if you want to think that he can win as a lead option, the truth is he never fully proved that throughout his career. || KD with all his samples is a team ceiling riser. He has been to multiple star packed teams but it did not see the success they were aiming for. It doesn't help that he is also out of luck in terms of injury. But the reason we can point out to KD is his playstyle. Ideally, you would only want KD in your team after you have covered all the bases or you are lacking a piece to contend. This is why many are speculating for him to go to rockets most likely. They have already the defensive foundation but their offensive is lacking.

For an instance. Lebron in Cavs and even Miami, he is the team floor riser. His consistent appearance to playoffs and finals made him a very valuable piece towards building the whole team. We even see that in the recent olympics.

KD can be an important piece to a winning team like he did in GS but he will never be winning anything as the lead option that fills many gaps. He can be the lead option in scoring only but as the real, all in all, number 1 guy, you need a more complete (good offense, defense, availability, and playmaking) player to do it (Giannis, Tatum, prime Lebron). || Westbrook was clearly the leader of that okc team. Kd was just the best player. Very different things

You made this long ass post yapping about something you don’t even understand lol || OP has got to be a KD burner. Homie has been defending KD to the death in the last 24 hours, got ratio’d and decided to create this post for round 2 || [removed] || Durant obviously could be the best player on a championship team. He’s proven that throughout his career. He led his team to the Finals in 2012 and lost to a hungrier, more experienced Heat team. Injuries prevented that team from going back, not anything KD was lacking

A very large contingent of NBA fans hate KD for costing LeBron some extremely valuable legacy years where they believe he would’ve won more rings were it not for Durant joining GS. I’m sure Derrick Rose fans felt similarly when LeBron took his talents to South Beach to join another Top 3-5 player in Wade. Does Rose reach the NBA finals in 2011 if the Heatles don’t exist? Could he have won a championship?

He’s a Top 15-20 guy ever and no one in that range is unable to lead a team to a championship. Circumstances and luck are just as much an important factor as anything else || He never won as a #1 so what's there to debate? He definitely *could* have won a ring as a #1, but he didn't. Why are we talking hypotheticals when his career is coming to an end? We have reality. It's not like his career was derailed by injury (shout out to him for coming back from his achilles tear so succesfully).

If KD's happy having won two rings as a #2, that's great for him, but I'm not going to give him credit for winning a ring as a #1 when he didn't.

You play the game to achieve what you can, not to show what you could have achieved in an alternate reality. || You're not wrong... BUT you could argue the greats overcame injuries and sickness, both their own and their teammates.

Jordan in '98. Kobe in '10, Nowitzki in '11. Curry in '15.

When people say he's not a championship #1, it's exactly because he hasn't consistently overcome those issues. He's insanely good, but doesn't have the track record of pulling his team through when the going gets tough, which, as you said, it nearly always does. || The issue with Durant is that he is not an “instant” fit for a team. 

Durant is one of the best pure scorers and pure shooters basketball has ever seen, period. 

But that is entirely what he is. He isn’t a great rebounder. He isn’t a great playmaker or even a good secondary playmaker. He isn’t a great defender. He doesn’t move well without the ball. He doesn’t do “blue collar” basketball jobs like setting screens or picks well, or even bringing energy. 

Which means - you can easily build around Kevin Durant, but the players around him need to fit him. 

In the case of Phoenix, Bradley Beal is the exact same as Durant, except for shorter and worse. And although Booker is good at some of the things Durant isn’t (playmaking, screen setting, moving without the ball), his best strength is scoring - but it isn’t as good as Durant’s scoring..so he’s been trying to do the other things, and it just makes him a worse player. He also doesn’t score the same way as Durant. Durant likes a slower paced one on one game, where as Booker scores best being set up and through movement. 


Kevin Durant has hit enough shots to prove he’s clutch, I don’t think he’s a great leader..but a GM would be perfectly capable of building around him..as long as there is an honest assessment of what he’s good at and where he needs help. || >but that last piece of the puzzle is injury luck and timing, not really about kds ability to win as a #1.

So there's one piece of the puzzle that you're missing. While it's true that KD has had some bad injury luck, and comparing KD to Melo feels like not something that any serious basketball thinker is doing, I do think you're being very dismissive of one hole in KD's game. It's a hole that showed up in the 2016 WCF (when IMO the Thunder would have won the title if they could have finished off that series) and in the Brooklyn first-round sweep at the hands of Boston. 

And that's the fact that KD gets a little tunnel-visiony when he gets into his motion, and that motion can be a little slow, and that combination creates the opportunity for smart defenses to double team him in a highly effective way. 

If you compare him to LeBron, it's easy to see the difference. There's no way to effectively double LeBron, because he doesn't have that moment when he's holding the ball where he's vulnerable - he's a little quicker and more powerful, but more importantly, he knows the double team is coming practically before the double teamer does, and can beat it with a pass. But KD likes to get into his spot and get into his bag, and the best defenses in the playoffs scout that and game-plan to exploit it. It was a major driver of the Warriors comeback in 2016. 

Okay, that's comparing KD to the best player ever. Let's compare him to Steph. Steph has two things that are relevant here, that point to the gap. First of all, when Steph wants to shoot he shoots. His release all over the court is much quicker. This forces teams to double team him early, which is what creates the sometimes endless series of 4-on-3s for the Warriors. Furthermore, because his release is so quick, defenders err on the side of defending him more than they have to. (Hilariously, there was a moment in the finals where the Cavs doubled Steph, despite the fact that KD had the ball, allowing KD to waltz to the rim for a bucket - this shows the impact of a lightning-quick shot). 

The other difference highlighted by a comparison with Steph is his relationship with coaching. KD wants to play KD ball. For only about a season did he accept playing in a more efficient way - moving off ball, shooting on the move, etc. What this essentially means is that KD *hasn't* prioritized winning above all else. The evidence suggests that he'd rather *come clos*e his way than change to win it all. Now, he's hardly the only great player with this flaw (Kobe, certainly, had the same issue, as did MJ to a lesser extent) but it is a real flaw. || KD is not that guy and we need to stop treating him as such. His ideal role is a 1B or a 2. He doesn’t have the full package to lead a team to the promised land. Nor the leadership or accountability. It bothers me how much people let KD get away with stuff that LeBron or curry would never get away with. || Lots of guys in the 2010s will be forgotten or not thought of as highly as they should be because of how many dynasty teams there were. Obviously lebrons teams shut down lots of great teams, then came the warriors probably the greatest dynasty besides MJs bulls. I dont think any other era had only 2 or 3 guys dominating as much as bron and Steph did from like 2014-2021 besides Jordan but I think parity and the NBA skill floor has raised a lot making it harder to sustain that level of domination. || >Most championships require some sort of injury luck, the right bracket, and perfect timing for cohesiveness.

This seems like quite an immeasurable premise on which to rest an entire argument. What makes something lucky or unlucky, what qualifies as the ""right"" bracket, what qualifies as ""perfect timing"", what makes something ""cohesive""? Surely there are teams who lost who met a lot of those things. 

It's like saying a basketball player's good nutrition requires delicious food and many flavors. What makes something delicious and what qualifies as many? How long is a piece of string?

The reason Durant faces criticism about his ability to win as a lead option is because if you consider Curry the lead option for GSW -- which he was -- than Durant hasn't done so. Seems pretty straightforward. || I’ve watched KD his entire career. He just isn’t a leader & winner like other players are.  He is also unlikable. || he wasn't even the center of the plays in OKC, its Westbrook while in GS it was Steph

only in the Nets and Suns were the game plan revolves around him. || I truly think most people that critize KD's ring or KD as a number one option are just people that want Steph to look better

KD was clearly better than Steph during those 2 rings. There was no debate at the time. 

He was also amazing at OKC, could've won it all with the Nets with a tiny bit of luck and more. 

KD can win. And so could other players that ended up not getting rings in their primes (CP3 and Harden come to mind). A lot of that comes down to luck. Better referees (or health) in 2018 and Harden/CP3 would probably have a ring.

I think we should rank players on their merits, not on what the luck-of-the-draw gave them. 

Heck, Steph and his team won more finals against Bron then otherwise. We all know Bron was better in every single game. || It's obvious KD has what it takes to win as lead option based on talent alone. However, he might be lower on that scale compared to someone with less talent due to his personality and lack of leadership. || kd will never get the credit he deserves till he wins a title without golden state || You could talk all day about what he could’ve done but we do know what he did (or didn’t) do.  

His legacy would’ve been much better off had he never won those titles with GSW most likely - you don’t join up with the team who won the most games in regular season history and who eliminated you in the playoffs to get your rings.  That would’ve been like LeBron joining the Celtics, Lakers, or Spurs instead of the Heat.  Say whatever about super team, but the Heat won 47 games and lost to Boston (who eventually lost the Finals to the Lakers in 7) the year before.

While Kawhi is not the level of player Durant is all time, his legacy is much better off as he grew into his role and led the team that drafted him to the championship (Kawhi was Finals MVP) over LeBron and the Heat, ending their mini-dynasty.  Then he went to a Toronto team that was swept by Cleveland and LeBron the year prior and led them to the title, beating Durant and Curry in the process, ending the GSW dynasty. || Being able to “outplay Kawhi in his prime” or “battle LeBron to a standstill” is supposed an impressive career defining trait ?

If these are the best things you have to prove his legacy then I think here’s the answer to your qn

Lol || He literally had 2 HOF teammates. And choked it. Every time. His performance in those lost series speaks for itself. You have to be outright delusional to claim otherwise.

KD is a busrider, and would never have a ring if he didn't join a team that would win those rings without him. || Lots of things I could get into, but for root cause of why he has trouble leading a team to a chip, is he’s not a leader. He makes a point of not wanting to be a leader. He feels it is not his place to hold teammates accountable (whether Kyrie or a 7th man). He just doesn’t seem comfortable with it. He just wants to hoop, and he hoops great. 

That’s part of the reason he did well at GSW. The team WITHOUT HIM was already an absolutely complete, well oiled machine without him, with Leadership and player accountability through Steph (and some degree Dray). When KD was on that team, GSW went 27-4 with just Curry when KD sat out. KD was OVERKILL on those teams, he could just ball out and put up overkill stats in uncontested games. He put up the best monster stats with no pressure, but that doesn’t mean he was the most important player. 

But if KD had to be the man without Steph, team went 24-17 when Steph was out.
