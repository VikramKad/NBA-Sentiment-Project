Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"""Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""Shai"" OR ""Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""The Shai""",2024-01-03,nbadiscussion,18yc5e2,Guys like shai is making me rethink the importance of getting low on drives,"Watching Shai beating the entire Celtics roster off the dribble the other day is nothing short of incredible. The thing that pops out the most watching shai is he doesn’t get that low when driving past defenders compared to the likes of Kyrie, AI, Rose, other great drivers in the past. He just sort of glides while staying half-upright.

I also see this from Curry, who dribbles with his torso quite upright, and yet still able to blow by people. I understand defenders have to respect Curry’s shot so much that he can get by them, but this is not the case for Shai since he’s not a volume 3pt shooter.

Growing up I was taught to get as low as possible when driving by defenders, but I’m not so sure if that’s really necessary anymore. My theory is that NBA defenders are subconsciously wired to react to players getting super low when driving, that their bodies don’t react when someone like Shai, who only slightly lowers his body on drives. What do you guys think?",288,59,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/18yc5e2/guys_like_shai_is_making_me_rethink_the/,2024-01-04 07:35:27,"I feel like we need some video analysis of this to see what’s happening and the comparisons you’re trying to make.

Great topic btw!  I was wondering something similar lately related to the advice to “catch up to your shoulders” when driving, and to have a shin angle on drives that is parallel to the angle of your shoulders/torso. || Your observation is correct, but I would still emphasize “low man wins” to 99% of basketball players. Curry gets low when he’s dribbling in traffic. Shai is dangerous because he can play off the pivot and kill in the midrange, so defenders really have no sure fire way of stopping him- play too close he goes by, give space and he’s money. || Derek White is another guy that stays fully upright on drives. Whether or not this is effective seems dependent on the type of finisher you are. If you’re doing scoop or finger roll type layups, you’ll need to be low to get the angle. 

But if you release high, like a floater or teardrop, then upright would be better. || It is very important. Look at the people u listed who stay low and keep their centre of gravity low, none of them are above 6'3. Curry can do this because he is an excellent shooter off the dribble, he's not a slasher and he wants to be in rhythm when shooting, you cant do that when ur low and have your gears turned on to drive to the basket. Now, look at Shai: he's a 6'6 wing sized guard who is not the fastest or most athletic in NBA standards at all. What he does to get by people is his length and craft, that's the difference between him and someone shorter who needs to be stable and ready to push off in order to get to the rim. || I think the exception kinda proves the role.

Shai is a really unique player. I think it's extremely rare to have a guard that size, with that handle, with that speed, who's also extremely patient and has a mastery of timing and angles like he does.

The same way it's kinda hard to draw generalized conclusions from Curry, because literally no one else is bringing his combination of skills to the table. || Thanks for bringing this up.  I always thought he moved differently on drives that broke my brain when he gets to the rim.  I’ve seen it from other players as well.  Maybe when your handles and ability to create angles is that good you don’t need as low center of gravity to get past or deceive defenders.  It might also help them demonstrate the threat to shoot. || Big difference between where the depth is coming from. Ankle > knee > hip. I think shai gets quite low, almost entirely from his ankles and knees so it is subtle but he has a clear leverage advantage. Similar with curry. || Shai and Curry both aren't freak athletes in terms of explosion. Maybe thats why. They rely more on craft and skill to get to the rack, versus quickness and vertical leap. || Staying tall gives a player more options. It's usually you need to get low to get by someone because you can usually push off faster, but once you are by the initial defender, you need height to see more of the floor and the goal. Plus most players these days don't do straight line drives if they are the main ball handler. They stop and go a lot to keep pressure everywhere. || I really hope with all my heart that Shai is gonna be the face of the league in the next 10 years. 

This guy fucking killed us at the Fiba WC (im fr) but the way he plays and his charisma are really something else || Sga definitely gets low on his drives at 6’5, if you pay close attention you’ll also notice how much pressure he puts on his ankles and shins when he stops on the dime and changes direction. You can’t do that without getting low. || What you are taught to do and what nba players can do are wildly different. I don’t know you but do you have the ability to bend the defence to your will while you have the ball? Players like Steph, SGA and the like can so what they can do is different but for 99% of everyone else get low. || I might be crazy, but Shai's offensive game has always reminded me more of a less explosive, more slithery Pistons Grant Hill than any of the guards you listed. The hunchbacked dribble, aggressively tight hesis and crossovers, efficient spin moves, plus a ton of oddball finishes and creative dumpoffs in the paint - even their jumpshots look similarly weird to my eyes. It makes sense because SGA is closer in height to Hill than the guards you listed, but his skills combined with modern NBA spacing have allowed him to flourish as a self-creating scorer in a way the crafty wings of yesteryear could've only dreamed of. || While I appreciate your attention to detail and your analysis on how certain players have different techniques, I don't think you should be asking for basketball playing tips on this sub lol.

I'll humor you though. Every athlete is different and style of play has so much to do with size, skillset, coordination, comfort and who you play against. In general, it's a very good idea to have a low center of gravity and when you stay low you can achieve this while also being able to create the most explosive strides you can when gathering to jump or move forward. It also allows for quicker steps and my favorite part, the vision to set up your feet and body in angles that make the defender helpless when you are attacking them. That being said......it's really up to what makes you comfortable and what works for you. A lot of people develop their basketball games based on their childhood and how they had to adjust their game to beat older bigger opponents. This is what developed my floater, my tendency to use foot work to beat my opponents mentally rather than by being faster or bigger and it forced me to have a super fast release because otherwise I would get blocked all the time. Different NBA players have quirks that they developed over the years that make their game unique and effective but they wouldn't work for everyone and just because it does for them doesn't mwan you should copy them. Practice your driving and see what leads to the most effective style. Don't worry about doing it a certain way but instead worry about doing it effectively. || Grew up playing with half of the LA And 1 squad and with classmates that made it to the NBA, I understand exactly what you mean as I get very low on my drives. Even now into my 40’s, I still lower my upper body to angle and squeeze by and through defenders. That said, what I’ve noticed is players that are able to drive with a somewhat upright torso have unusually powerful legs and footwork that allow for that positioning. 

Curry has some of the strongest lower leg strength off any guard in the league. I remember hearing stories on how he used to regularly squat more than most his team. Shai is similar, i have a friend that works with NBA athletes during offseason in LA. He mentioned that Shai’s lower body is one of the strongest in the league for guards. One last point that you should keep in mind as well is quickness and conditioning, when you have more speed and conditioning than the player guarding you, its much easier for you to “blow past” players with the need to angle upper body. || D-Wade, Jordan and A.I were masters of getting low - SGA is a tad slower than them but he’s able to replicate that skill really well. A lot of videos of Jordan driving you’ll see his shoulders at the level of the defenders’ knees. || Haha no. You need to get low, most everyone else needs to, he doesnt.

He has the combination of speed, quickness, size, strength, shiftiness to not have to against certain defenders. || It depends on the guy, I think. For some guys it's more fluid and natural and they can get enough explosion but for power guys, I think it's still important to get low in order to get through contact. Guys like Steph, Halliburton and SGA rely a lot more on deception than power so it's fine for them. || An underrate part of this convo is reffing and foot speed. Getting low usually means driving with intent to dip your shoulder past the opponent so they have to go through you to reach the ball. Now imagine your 6'6"" and have refs that call everything, by going high you increase the chance of contact because you literally want to attack the defenders arms since if he touches you, foul. You're not getting that call at lower levels or req league. Think of Harden who looooves hanging that ball up high on a drive explicitly to get contact. The worst thing is reaching the rim and the ball is low because now you have to bring it up through the trees. Instead think of a Giannis or LeBron or Harden, they keep it high so when they reach rim, they don't have to bring it back up. If your handles are worse then you keep it lower to keep it out of reach. || The biggest thing is that Shai has a 6’11” wingspan. He doesn’t have to get low to keep the ball and that is the intent getting low is ball protection. If you can keep the ball low while losing none of your court vision that makes you unique and in his case the best PG in the NBA || Dude what are you talking about?

Defenders don't need to worry about Shai shooting because he's a low volume shooter??? 

Dude is shooting 55/45/90, literally a historically great shooting season.

You absolutely have to respect his shot, that's why he can get away with it.

You already had the answer. || The best dribblers are fake artists. And to fake the opponent everything is important, the position of your body as well. He must never know what are you doing next. || Kyrie and Rose rely more on changing direction to avoid contact whereas Shai can drive with just a little bit of direction advantage, take contact in a fairly upright position, and it doesn't faze him much at all as he brings the ball back for a midrange. Both of them get low when they really want to change direction quickly (left/ right) because the knee stance require them to for acceleration.

Also Shai has a long ass wingspan which probably affects how he dribbles. Don't need to get as low for the ball to not have so much air before it gets back to the hand. || i think the big thing is that he's not really trying to ""win"" the contact, just get you off balance enough to not contest his crazy accurate fadeaway.

most of the time you're trying to go through your defender and stay on balance yourself, but shai is fine getting knocked back because that's where he thrives || SGA’s ability to play “herky-jerky” is totally underrated. Great observation || Interesting observation.  I made a similar observation watching Jared Vanderbilt play defense against the Knicks the other week.  Somehow he is able to slide and stay in front easily while staying upright.  These guys might just be freaks among freaks || Sga is 6’6, he has long strides. The main thing with him is his change of speed and his physicality. || I’ll try to add videos tomorrow, you’re right videos will make it much easier for everyone || Kyrie and Rose rely more on changing direction to avoid contact whereas Shai can drive with just a little bit of direction advantage, take contact in a fairly upright position, and it doesn't faze him much at all as he brings the ball back for a midrange. They all get low when they really want to change direction quickly (for maximum left/ right separation) because the knee stance require them to for acceleration.

Also Shai has a long ass wingspan which probably affects how he dribbles. Don't need to get as low for the ball to not have so much air before it gets back to the hand. Look at Jamal Crawford's clinical dribbling crossovers.

As for Steph, OP is basically right. He will maintain upright position for threat of shooting. It's rare that he gets low because half the time he isn't accelerating or changing direction much. || Being a 6’6” guard who the defense cant speed up , gives you certain luxuries most of us dont have",0.116,0.608,0.276,0.4404,0.07,0.814,0.117,0.7893,0.097,0.771,0.132,0.9978
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"""Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""Shai"" OR ""Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""The Shai""",2024-01-11,nbadiscussion,1954bdf,What Western Conference team is the biggest competition to the Nuggets?,"The 3 teams that come to mind to me are the Wolves, OKC, and Clippers

Wolves- Wolves to me are a matchup nightmare to go against in the playoffs imo. Besides Conley who can be a somewhat serviceable defender they got defenders everywhere with KAT and Rudy packing the paint it’ll be hard for any team to beat them 4 times. Jokic and other Nuggets players even said this was their hardest matchup en route to a championship.


Clippers- Clippers finally seem to put everything together and Harden has shut all his haters up for people saying this “wouldn’t work.” Kawhi and PG have finally hit their stride more since Harden completely took a back seat and is fully leaning in to the PG role with his astounding playmaking. Add on their bench unit which could start on some teams and this team will cause problems in the playoffs. The only downside imo is that I don’t think they have a guy who can stop Jokic. Zincs could do a decent job but he’s definitely not slowing down Jokic at all.


OKC- It seems like Shai is clicking on all cylinders. Coming off one of the most efficient 31 PPG seasons of all time he seemed to one up himself by not only averaging 31 PPG on better efficiency but playing ELITE defense while doing it averaging  2.3 steals a game. Add that to their 5 out offense and that allows Shai to fully cook one on one which he has since he’s one of the greatest isolation players in the league. I truly believe Shai is without a doubt a Top 10 player in the league (Top 5 this season if we’re being honest) and add Chet who’s been phenomenal on both ends his rookie year and J Dub who’s also been phenomenal then this team has a great shot to compete against Denver in the West.

HM- Kings",100,88,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1954bdf/what_western_conference_team_is_the_biggest/,2024-01-12 15:03:08,"I just want people to stop calling us (Wolves) the Nuggets worst matchup. Knowing Minnesota sports, we'll win our first 2 series only to get swept by DEN in the WCFs. Karma for everyone calling us the worst matchup for them since the off season. || Clippers probably don't have anyone to stop Jokic but I don't think there really is anyone stopping Jokic in the playoffs. Best you can do is get him to be in foul trouble and as of now they have three guys to send at him (Zu, Theis and Plumlee) and enough talented players that can drive to the basket and try to hunt him to get fouled (or he'll let them score to avoid foul trouble). || Talent wise it’s the clippers. There the most talented team in the league. Harden gives them an element that they didn’t haven when the nuggets beat them in the bubble. They would also have 3 of the 4 best players in the series. Matchup wise it’s the wolves, they destroyed the nuggets last time they played earlier in the season. They have the bigs to give Jokic some problems, and McDaniels can give Murray problems. || The Clippers. I don't know what they'll do but the ceiling is really high for a team with that many stars. They could go on a run and roll everybody || People seem to be really high on the thunder right now and I can see why with their stats but we just don’t know if it’ll translate to the playoffs. I still think the nuggets are by far the scariest team in the west followed by the wolves then clips barring injuries. 

I’m biased in saying this but I think the Kings are a dark horse competitor in the west this year depending on who we match up with. || I wonder if folks on this sub actually watched the game in December when the Clippers played great defense on Jokic and forced him into a 9-32 shooting night. I was there at the game. Jokic even stated that they played good defense on him. Will that happen every night? No. But, they clearly had a plan and it worked. Why wouldn't they be able to have a similar game again? || The wolves can guard Jokic one on one with Gobert and try to stay home on shooters.  Ant is the best wing in that series, but there are enough bodies to slow him down and he doesnt have any real help on the wing.  Murray takes Conley easy.  Benches are a wash.

Clippers are a defensive matchup problem for everyone from an iso perspective.  KCP, Gordon, and Porter are inferior to Harden, George, and Kawhi.  Late game buckets on isos are going to determine a lot of the game.  Let Harden play hero ball and the clippers cant win.  

OKC is fun, but have a long way to go.  Murray and Jokic take care of them easily. || The Nuggets said that playing the Wolves was their hardest matchup last year and they only got better so I'll say the Wolves. They have the correct defensive make up to guard the Nuggets and an Edwards led PnR theoretically is a great way to attack Jokic in space and abuse him. Whether the Wolves have enough offensive firepower to keep up with the Nuggets is a different question though. I don't think the Clips or Suns match up particularly well with the Nuggets and OKC is brand new so it's impossible to really tell at this point. || I would give a HM to Dallas and NoLa over Sacramento. Luka is good enough to outduel anyone individually in the playoffs and Kyrie is a good enough running mate to fill in the gaps. Pelicans, I like their depth and options over what Sacramento has. || I think the Clippers if they are healthy, and thats a big IF.

OKC is unproven yet and i can see them winning a round, but probably losing to a more veteran team. 

Wolves, i dont trust. 

Clippers have the depth and all the wings to score, while having Kawhi playing amazing ball, and he is proven champion. 

I still take the Nuggets to come out of the west, but i think if anyone is going to do it, it will be Clippers. || As an OKC/Clippers fan, I don’t think anybody else beyond Minnesota has the guns. Denver also needs to be healthy to be honest - without Murray or Gordon they’re significantly impaired, and bismillah if Jokic goes down then they’re merely a 4-seed equivalent with a championship pedigree. 

OKC: obviously on fire and Chet adds a whole new dimension. He’d probably get in foul trouble with Denver’s bigs but if he could avoid that and stretch the floor, they have the SGA-bomb and the sky’s the limit. Daigneault and extreme inexperience comparatively are their limiting factors otherwise. I think both are surmountable

LAC: Health and depth, finally a fine ass bench. Kawhi uninjured has a top 3 ceiling. If PG and Harden don’t slump hard, they have bodies to attack Jokic and the offense to match up 

MIN: I agree is the best matchup with their size and defense. KAT obviously can be a powerhouse but Ant is that fuckin dawg they’ve always needed. Love to see it, just not when facing them in playoffs 

All around I also agree OKC and LAC’s best hope is that Minnesota beats Denver first or some other fluke || Easily the Clippers multiple closers and one on one bucket getters and Zubac is big enough to bang wit Jokic || Denver is great but they do have their weaknesses and every serious team in the West has spent the last 6+ months putting those weaknesses under the microscope. What are they?

1. Obviously the biggest issue for Denver has always been **the non-Jokic minutes**. That's normally going to hurt them less in the playoffs but teams can try and tire him out to partly counteract that. While Jokic is in much better shape than he was a few years back, he's still a huge and not quick guy that prefers the Nuggets' slow (29th in league) pace. Teams can try to tire him out by pushing the pace, targeting him on defense, offering him single coverage in the post, banging on him, going deeper into their bench to keep rotating fresh bodies in, etc.  

2.  The **Nuggets' defense is a house of cards**.  Yes they have improved a lot and are a high ranked defense .. BUT, there are still 3 starters that can be liabilities and, most importantly, their defense depends heavily on the offense's efficiency at scoring. This is why Jokic's defensive impact metrics (like Steph's) can greatly exceed the eyeball test. So having your own great defense is extra important for beating Denver. More specifically you want a defense that is strong against both Jokic's elite passing and Murray's scoring.  For Murray you need multiple strong-elite PoA defenders.  For Jokic's passing you need length and athleticism across your team to clog up the passing lanes, you need some rim protection to help control cutters, and you need someone that can not get swallowed up in the low post.  

Taking a look at the teams that have given Denver the most trouble this season -- their losses include ORLx2, OKCx2, HOUx3, MIN (1/1) -- we see these things hold up.  All 4 of these teams have great defenses, are young, long and athletic, feature an All Defense level guy at PoA (Suggs, Dort, Brooks, McDaniels) backed up by other strong options (Black, Shai/JDub, FVV/Tari, Ant/NAW) and 3/4 have excellent primary rim protection (Goga, Chet, Rudy). || The clippers are better 2-15 than the nuggets and Kawhi has proven that he can definetly perform at a Jokic level during the playoffs. Outside of Murray, the nuggets don’t really have anyone that can match the starpower in LA. Funny enough, I’d say Harden’s performance is the true x-factor in a series between these teams. Denver’s bench is also much worse this year. The clippers have the best bench in the league with two 6MOTY candidates + multiple premium role players. || Clippers & Suns are the biggest threat to them. You need some serious firepower to compete with Denver in the playoffs. Having one superstar with decent role players around him isn’t going to cut it. Defense won’t really matter as much as you think, Jokic has already seen it and knows how to counter it so your team better be able to go bucket for bucket with Denver.

OKC has had a great regular season and their fans should be proud of that but when the playoffs start veteran superstars are going to have their way with that team, especially a player like Jokic. As for the Wolves, great defense but they just don’t have enough on offense to get over the hump.

Remember, regular season and the playoffs are almost different sports. || I really think nuggets just sent clear favorites anymore. Young teams in the west have taken a leap the west is harder this year. Not to mention the new look clippers. They still have a pretty good chance though because they have the best player in basketball || I'd say the Wolves and Clippers. Lakers could possibly be but they need to make some moves to match up with them and like... sign Dwight Howard. The only reason I even mention them is cuz I do feel like they're going to make a bunch of moves as they do seemingly every year before the team makes a big push for a run. || In addition to the teams you listed in this post I think the Pelicans have a shot || I think Timberwolves can match up with them since they have 2 guys in the front court to bother Jokic || There are no true contenders but the Kings and and Timberwolves have the kind of Centers and G's that can give the Nuggets trouble. || I don’t know for sure who is the biggest competition. Only thing I will say for sure is okc and Minnesota do not have the playoff experience to me to be a threat. The clippers are older but have the big 4 who have been to the playoffs. Okc zero experience, Minnesota has been there but I feel like they haven’t made it out of the first round so not a big enough sample for me to be convinced. Also with Minnesota the only person I trust is Edwards with no experience, rudy made it to the conference finals with Utah but they were never a real contender. Kat needs to prove himself more. || OKC has a great starting five but there is no way they could challenge Denver's depth. Yea Shai would score 30ppg but about seven nugget players would score double digits || I don't see anyone beating the clippers so I'll have to say them. Kawhi is 16-1 since december, his only loss was vs the Lakers when he just got back after missing a few games. They are two games behind the first seed, despite the fact they lost six straight when Harden first joined. Record wise I think they're better than even Celtics since figuring out Hardens role. They'll only get better too which is scary to think about. || Wolves, OKC, and thunder? 😂 I know you meant clippers, and I agree that's personally who I think poses the greatest challenge to Denver. Revenge series from the bubble coming up. || The Clippers have all king’s best horses and men, but no body that can cover Jokic, like no one could put Humpty Dumpty back together. Which is kinda a big problem in the playoffs, if you don’t have a guy that can cover MJ or a Shaq/Kobe…going to be very long series.

The T-Wolves might have the size and defense to do it, but I can see them losing to a more experienced roster in the first or second round. 

OKC, good young team, but I can see them being taken down in the playoffs, pretty quickly. || The team that has an elite rim protector an elite POA defender and a team that can space the Nuggets defense out. 

So right now it’s only the Wolves. The Lakers andThunder already have elite rim protectors so they just need the missing pieces listed above. Shooters for the Thunder and Shooting and POA defense for the Lakers. || Even though I doubt they face off, Houston Rockets surprisingly stacks up good against the Nuggets. We have similar players with similar skillsets. || I agree those are the top 3, but I'd still take Denver to the finals for sure. They have the perfect pieces, they're in their prime, and they now have playoff experience. Denver v Boston is my (not at all risky) pick. || I love OKC, but we aren’t stopping jokic at any time. He’s far too big of a body for Chet. And despite Lou Dort being a phenom and D against other bigs, he’s too small. OKC aren’t it.

Clips, with zu and Plumlee still aren’t stopping him.

Wolves though, maybe gobert can do a bit to stop his inside. Kat can stop his outside. They aren’t stopping his playmaking. Though antman could lockdown Murray well. 

For any team to beat the nugs in a 7 game series you have to pick your poison. Jokic will get his, nobody is stopping him. But a team effort on stopping the rest of the team is possible.

Do you just let jokic feed himself, or let him feed the whole team. That is how you stop the nuggets. Let jokic get his, defend the rest of the team exceptional || I’d remove the Thunder in favor of the Pelicans. Just because Shai would be the only threat and Nuggets’ size and defense could shut down the rest of the Thunder squad. The Pelicans have threats at every position, size, perimeter defense, and a center who can stop Jokic more capably than Chet. But the Thunder is not a horrendous pick. Kings and Mavs are terrible matchups against the Nuggets which rounds out the upper half of the West.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.06,0.807,0.133,0.9806,0.085,0.747,0.168,0.9997

I like to check in and do my personal quarterly awards to help me remember who was playing well at various points throughout the season.

With that as the caveat, remember that this is purely for the stretch played from Dec 5th to Jan 15th, when most teams had played about 20 games (so it doesn't include yesterday's games). Let me know who you'd have picked in the comments!

# Rookie of the Quarter: Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio Spurs

Last quarter, [I gave this to Chet Holmgren](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/nba-2023-24-first-quarter-awards). This quarter, though, Wembanyama was undeniable. It’s incredible to see arguably the most hyped NBA prospect of all time come into the league and fulfill or surpass nearly every expectation.

Wemby’s quarterly statline of 20.0/11.0/3.4 is impressive enough. Add in a silly 3.7 blocks per game (a significant increase on his first quarter, as he’s been allowed to play more center) and other [tremendous defensive numbers](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact?CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*4&DateFrom=01/05/2024&PerMode=PerGame&dir=A&sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT), and Wembanyama is making a legitimate case for All-Star and All-Defensive teams as a rookie.

He noticeably improved his decision-making and passing, averaging nearly an assist per game more and a turnover per game fewer (although, like most rookie big men, he still loses the ball too often).

\[As always, I've created a bunch of illustrative GIFs for this post. They [can be viewed in-context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/second-quarter-awards-for-the-2023), or at the links throughout the article. I think they add a lot to the piece. Thanks!\]

Wembanyama’s recent triple-double against Detroit showed his playmaking upside, and he’s already exploiting tiny cracks in the defense from all over the court: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/second-quarter-awards-for-the-2023)\]

Defensively, Wembanyama [could’ve swept last year’s Oscars](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-wins-7-oscars-2023-1235349378/): he’s everything, everywhere, all at once. Ballhandlers panic when they approach the paint and see him looming. He has absurd flexibility and quick-twitch movements for someone built to give Slenderman nightmares. A weird little quirk: he tries to kick passes a little often for my liking, leaving him vulnerable to pass fakes, but he’s shockingly quick to recover: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/second-quarter-awards-for-the-2023)\]

The best part? He’s still developing his instincts. There are multiple times every game where it seems through the TV that Wemby had a chance to make a play but didn’t. He’s already getting better at that, too (his basketball IQ and rapidly improving processing speed aren’t talked about enough, given all the other exciting things to discuss).

If you like Holmgren’s ability to drive winning with two-way play as a rookie, go ahead and pick him. I did last quarter, so you’ll hear no arguments from me. It’s incredible to have two rookies playing so well that they’ll garner looks for multiple end-of-season awards meant for veterans. But Wemby is my pick this time around, and if things keep trending the way they have, I suspect he might be next quarter, too.

Shout out to Jaime Jaquez Jr. in Miami, an obsession of mine having an incredible rookie season. He is so far in third place as not to even be in the rear-view mirror.

# Interior Defensive Player of the Quarter: Rudy Gobert, Minnesota Timberwolves

(I believe interior defense is foundationally more important than perimeter defense. Therefore, Defensive Player of the Year should virtually always go to a big man. But that doesn’t mean perimeter defenders don’t deserve love, so I’ve split this award into two parts.)

I thought for longer than I expected about Wembanyama — he’s been that good defensively for San Antonio. Brook Lopez made a strong case, leading the league in total blocks over this period and posting fantastic rim-protection numbers now that he’s again being used in his preferred deep-drop defense. Holmgren and Utah center Walker Kessler had major defensive impacts, and Clippers’ center Ivica Zubac posted a sneaky-good statistical case, too.

But Rudy Gobert is still the correct answer here. The Minnesota big man anchored [the league’s best defense](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2023&seasontype=regseason&start=12/5/2023&end=10/15/2024) in the second quarter. Opponents [shot just 50% at the rim against Gobert](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact?CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*50&DateFrom=12/05/2023&PerMode=Totals&dir=A&sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT), a top mark. On the season as a whole, [foes get to the rim -6.1% less often](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/players?stat_category=onoff_opponent_shooting_frequency) with Gobert on the court. No other player in the league combines that degree of rim protection and rim deterrence (although Joel Embiid is close, he’s missed too many games this quarter to qualify).

Something underappreciated about Gobert is that he always tries hard. He’s not perfect, but he has one of the highest motors of any big. His technique is rock-solid: his gigantic arms are always splayed out, his feet are always sliding, he lunges and recovers multiple times in a sequence — and then he’ll sprint down the floor on offense to set screens, roll hard, and grab boards. He never takes a play off; even for defensive-minded big men, that’s exceedingly rare.

Next quarter, I’m sure I’ll try to get cute and find someone else to write about. But Gobert may not make that an option.

# Perimeter Defensive Player of the Quarter: Alex Caruso, Chicago Bulls

Last quarter, [he won my Sixth Man award](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/nba-2023-24-first-quarter-awards); this time, he’s acknowledged for his defense. The Bald Eagle is strong as an ox, despite his 6’5” frame, and he is equally capable of guarding big wings as he is point guards. Advanced metrics love him despite (or possibly because?) of the weaker defensive talent elsewhere in Chicago.

Caruso teleports through screens as if they aren’t even there, forcing ballhandlers to pick up their dribble 35 feet from the hoop. He’s constantly pushing, grabbing, pulling, and generally making himself a nuisance. Opponents shot [\-7.4% worse than expected](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall?CF=GP*GE*15&DateFrom=12/05/2023) when Caruso guarded them, one of the best marks in the league regardless of position.

And that’s when they could even get the shot off in the first place. Watch as he absolutely destroys three different screens here, forcing the ball out of Terry Rozier’s hands (h/t to u/stephnoh for the [convenient illustrative video](https://twitter.com/StephNoh/status/1744546381090402564)).

Perimeter defense is arguably the part of basketball with the least reliable statistical backing. Once you have a reputation one way or another, it can linger for years before people recognize that narratives are no longer valid — this is how you end up with superstars getting All-Defensive nods years past their prime. While we’re better at recognizing elite perimeter defenders today, the eye test is still essential. To that end, nobody looked more impressive than Caruso in the season’s second quarter.

Herb Jones, last quarter’s winner OG Anunoby, Jalen Suggs, and Jaden McDaniels had strong cases (among many others; I can’t list them all), and due to the subjectivity of this particular process, I wouldn’t quibble if you wanted any of them.

# Sixth Man of the Quarter: Malik Monk, Sacramento Kings

Monk had a fantastic quarter, averaging 16 points and more than six assists per game. He hit 37% of his threes on very high volume and developed some beautiful chemistry with Domantas Sabonis. Watch as he takes the screen, waits patiently for a re-screen, then hooks a pass to Sabonis in traffic for a layup: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/second-quarter-awards-for-the-2023)\]

Other players scored more, and others (like Caruso) had a greater defensive impact. But Monk’s combination of shooting and playmaking is rare in Sixth men and a big part of why Sacramento’s bench has survived even when De’Aaron Fox or Domantas Sabonis rests.

The passing has been such a delight. His [full-year assist percentage of 30.3%](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4279#tab-offensive_overview) is higher than that of point guards like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Mike Conley, or Russell Westbrook, and while he can be a bit careless with the ball, he brings some much-needed energy to the Kings’ offense.

Watch as he softly threads this dime between three Thunder defenders to a cutting Kevin Huerter: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/second-quarter-awards-for-the-2023)\]

To my eyes, Monk’s defense has waned a bit from last year’s career-best effort, but his offensive growth outdoes any sliding on that end. It’s wild seeing how much Monk has grown as a distributor throughout his career, and he’s a worthy winner of the quarter’s Sixth Man award.

# Most Improved Player of the Quarter: Coby White, Chicago Bulls

Remember that for this award, I’m looking for players who have improved from the first quarter of the season, not from last year. So we won’t be talking about the Haliburtons, [Senguns](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived), and Maxeys of the world.

Our winner this quarter may thrust himself into that year-end conversation, though. Coby White has been a revelation since he began turning Chicago’s fortunes around.

In the first quarter of the season, White averaged 15 points, 4.2 assists, and 3.1 rebounds while shooting 43% from the field. Decent!

In the second quarter, he averaged 22 points and identical 5.6 rebound and assist marks. Way better!

Much of this was due to an increase in responsibility following Zach LaVine’s injury, but he played so well that, even with the Bulls at full strength, he’s still been one of their featured players. In six games this quarter with LaVine, White averaged 23/5.5/5.0. White is here, and he brought a lawn chair and some snacks. He’s not going anywhere.

One blemish: after a good defensive season last year, White’s defense has slipped since shouldering this more prominent role. I’m hopeful that he’ll regain his concentration on that end as he gains more experience as a primary offensive option.

Unlike defense, an area where White has truly improved this quarter is in his foul-drawing. White has been allergic to the free throw line for most of his career, but he’s been a little more effective of late, drawing 4.4 free throw attempts per game this quarter (and sporting an [above-average positional mark](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4578#tab-foul_drawing) now for the year). There’s still work to be done, but his handle is much tighter than in previous years, letting him get into the paint more often ([31% of his attempts are at the rim](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4578#tab-shooting_frequency), a good mark for a guard). He’s not afraid to attack tiny creases even in crowded traffic, and he’s getting rewarded: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/second-quarter-awards-for-the-2023)\]

At just 23 years old, White still has plenty of time to develop further, too.

# Coach of the Quarter: Ty Lue, Los Angeles Clippers

It’s hard to remember now, but the James Harden trade looked like a [John Carter-style bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biggest_box-office_bombs) at first. The team was out of sync, joyless, and frankly embarrassing.

But Lue never lost faith. He claimed he would need 10 games to understand how to maximize James Harden and the rest of the roster; turns out, that was playing it safe. After an initial six-game losing streak (which happened in the season’s first quarter), the Clippers took off. They were 16-4 in the quarter, a run of dominance buoyed by an outrageous scoring explosion: they [ranked first in the league in offensive rating](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2023&seasontype=regseason&start=12/5/2023&end=10/15/2024) over that time frame.

And Lue deserves much of the credit. He got Russell Westbrook to buy in — and excel! — in a bench role. He figured out how to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard moving in ways that make sense around Harden. He even nailed the little things, like keeping the effective Daniel Theis as the backup center even after Mason Plumlee returned from injury and banishing PJ Tucker from the rotation (Tucker may be traded or may make a comeback in the playoffs, but he’s likely at his end as a useful regular-season player).

The team looks like they’re having fun. Westbrook is laughing, [Harden is doing snow angels](https://www.espn.com/watch/player/_/id/39143666) after nailing big shots, and even Leonard has cracked a smile. Winning cures a lot, of course, but chemistry starts from the top — players unhappy with their playing time or role can’t easily contribute to a happy atmosphere.

And there was a lot of potential for discontent here; so far, Lue has navigated the team through dangerous waters with aplomb. Managing big stars with big money and big egos is difficult, and corralling role players expecting more (has anyone heard from Bones Hyland in a while?) can be tricky, too. Marrying that personnel management to clever Xs and Os is even harder. Ty Lue has done all that and more.

Joe Mazzulla has done creative things in Boston for the consensus best team in the East. Will Hardy deserved a long look here and would be a deserving winner for completely turning around a Jazz team that looked dead in the water in Q1. I’ve got more Utah stuff coming soon, so I’ll save my thoughts for now.

# Most Valuable Player: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City Thunder

On a per-game basis, Joel Embiid might have been the winner here. But he only played in 12 games; that’s not enough to qualify.

Luka Doncic has been arguably more impressive than Shai offensively, and he’s having perhaps his best defensive season ever. If you want to go with Luka, keeping the Mavs afloat as they battle injuries (four wins in the quarter over the hapless Trail Blazers sure helps!), I’m not going to argue.

But my Most Valuable Player of the Quarter is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Thunder were 14-6 this quarter, behind only the Clippers and Celtics in that stretch, and Gilgeous-Alexander was the beating heart of it all.

SGA averaged 33/6/6 in that time frame (as many points as Doncic on a per-minute basis) while playing excellent defense — full stop. Refreshingly, there is no need to qualify that last part.

Gilgeous-Alexander’s ball-hawking capabilities are no joke, and he’s the only player averaging more than two steals per game. Gilgeous-Alexander can play highway bandit in the passing lanes or rip someone off the dribble. He’s weaponized the poke-away from behind the ballhandler, a move lesser defenders do out of desperation but that SGA does from a position of strength: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/second-quarter-awards-for-the-2023)\]

The Thunder have even started using him to create havoc as the vanguard of a 1-2-2 zone, as he does here: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/second-quarter-awards-for-the-2023)\]

Offensively, Gilgeous-Alexander’s passing numbers are a bit muted by playing in an egalitarian offense in which everyone is encouraged to create for others. On other teams, he might average eight or nine assists per game. His dribble-drive game and ability to get into the paint open up easy passing avenues to the perimeter. Watch this filthy hesitation dribble to pump-fake combo that clears out 60% of defending Hawks: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/second-quarter-awards-for-the-2023)\]

Gilgeous-Alexander is my MVP for the quarter, and if he keeps this up, he may even have a chance to break the recent big-man hegemony on the real award.",131,17,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1990gmr/2nd_quarter_nba_awards_oc_analysis_who_would_you/,2024-01-17 11:21:26,"Great job! You’re missing the most impressive thing about wemby, HES DOING IT IN LIKE 21 MINUTES PER GAME or some nonsense like that || Malik's been having a good year and I'm always rooting for the beam team.  I think Caris Levert has been having an excellent 6moty campaign this quarter.  He's been huge in keeping the Cavs afloat, despite having an easy stretch of games over the past 10.  

The numbers look pretty similar when compared to Monk over the last 25 games.  Slightly lower shooting percentages, but less turnovers as well.  

Craig Porter Jr. has looked excellent this year and has been struggling in finding playing time because Caris has done so well in the secondary ball handler roll that he's settled into recently.

Time to get excited for All-Star selections and trades! || Wembenyama has delivered every bit on the promises we were given. Just a remarkable start to a career for a guy who is obviously a long, long way from the finished product. The improvement in his game from that first part of the season to the second is significant, and points to a ceiling well above where he's at already. I almost feel sorry for any young centres in the league with him and Holmgren around. || What about Clutch Player of the Year? Are they doing that again? I feel like I haven't heard anyone talking about it this year || Great analysis. I've got one point to add though. And it may be a hot take and it really shouldn't be.

Bam Adebayo needs to be talked about a whole lot more in the DPOY conversation. I don't really know what the stats say, but I've seen a few Miami games and he's one of the most versatile defenders in the league with no real defensive holes in his game. He can switch to the perimeter, drop, protect the rim, and play man defense, all at a very high level. He can play both the power forward and center spots on defense without losing a beat.

And a thing I love about his game: he's an intimidator. Like Brook Lopez, people think twice about attacking the rim when he's anywhere in the vicinity. Most of the buckets when he's anywhere near the basket have got to be assisted as the passer drew him out of position, though that may be just a very small sample size (seen like... 6 Heat games this year). I may overrate this (I was in the Brook Lopez for DPOY camp last year), but the ability to change the offensive system the other team runs is critical, especially when it allows Herro and Robinson to play and the Heat to still be defensive powerhouses.

Butler and Bam are perhaps the best defensive duo in this league, especially with how well they work together on that end. || Thanks! And yea, it's truly wild. || And leading the league in blocks. || Hey! This might be the first time anyone’s ever recognized me from there (BP) to Reddit, that’s awesome! Thank you! 

Thanks! Caris has been quite good. I was never a Caris fan, but I think he’s worked really hard as a defender and passer since coming to Cleveland, and I’ve been impressed with his development || Thought about it, but sample sizes are so small it just didn’t seem worth pursuing, tbh. Really need a bigger stretch of games IMO || I picked him as my DPOY two years ago! Last year was slightly down although it wasn’t Bam’s fault; the Heat were just using him more as dropper than as a switcher, which doesn’t play as much to his strengths (Claxton is facing the same issue this year). 

This year’s been sort of in-between. I do love Bam on both ends and think he’s criminally underrated. 

(I also had Brook as DPOY last year!) || I think I saw you on here first and subscribed, but I see BP pop in my email on the regular now and it makes me happy. || From what I've seen, Bam has improved as a dropper. Still not as good as he is as a switcher, but I think that he's now got one of the most well-rounded defensive games in the league.

- The Sixers need to keep Batum!!! Embiid and Batum as a duo are a +19.8, i believe easily the best high-minute 2-man duo on the team. He's an excellent passer/shooter/defender and most crucially, the best post entry passer on the team. It's actually kind of worrying how crucial he's been to our success lol, I love him sm

- 2019-20 Giannis is an underrated regular season because the Bucks were so mediocre in the Bubble, a +15.6 on-court net rating is one of the better marks all-time, not far from Steph's MVP seasons (+16.9 in 2015, +17.5 in 2016) and similar to LeBron's 1st MVP year in Cleveland (+15.3). His regular season impact metrics have  dipped and plateaued a little since 2021 (still MVP level, just not outlier-good like 2019 and 2020).

- The Mavs' on-court net ratings with Luka have been interestingly consistently mid despite every other indication pointing to him being monstrously impactful.

- The Thunder are scary! I wonder how insanely high they could rise if they could find Shai a starter level high volume movement-shooter --- his best partner net-rating wise is actually former Sixer Isaiah Joe off the bench (+18.8 as a duo!!).

- Jokic's +9.0 in 2022 is insanely impressive given the skeleton crew supporting cast he was working with. || [removed] || jokic’s 23 point swing on vs off is fucking insane. it makes me wonder what the all time highest single season on off difference is. || Thanks for this.  Is there a way to adjust these for quality of competition faced on a possession by possession level? || I feel like the MVP doesn't matter when it comes to nba players. Like for NFL qbs, it is defintily apart of their legacy, like, Rodgers and Brees both have 1 ring, but since Rodgers has 4 mvps hes better all time than Brees is.

this is definitely worth some investigation. guy puts up monster counting stats but on-off and most advanced stats like WS dont love him as much.

if the mavs roster is as flawed as everyone says, why are they basically a league average team with Luka out? thats a lot better than denver without jok || Incredible!

They also played a lot of starters and all bench units, winning the Jokic minutes and hoping the bench held on.

MVPs are incredibly important in the MLB and NBA, but not really all that important in the NFL.

People remember MVP seasons in the MLB and NBA far more than the NFL. || MVPs matter only when you don’t got them (Shaq and Kobe being downplayed sometimes for having only 1 each) || Weird opinion.

The two most-cited pieces of evidence you will see in All-Time Great debates is MVP's and rings.

Since 1991, there have only been two teams to win a title without an MVP (or former MVP) on their roster: the 2019 Raptors and the 2003 Pistons, so the MVP award does seem to translate very well into W's.

As for LeBron vs Jordan, you do realize that Jordan has the edge on LeBron in both rings and MVP's right?

There is, of course, much more complexity to a GOAT debate in any sport. A voted-on award like the MVP will never be definitive, but a context-dependent team achievement like a ring won't either (the degree of difficulty between, say, Dirk's 2011 ring and KD's 2017 ring, based on the strength of their teammates, is an enormous chasm). 

I couldn't really care less about the NFL, but, if anything, it seems like the sports where the MVP means the most are the ones where a team's best player has the least impact on team success, not the most, like MLB and NHL.

For a quarterback in the NFL, they control basically every offensive possession, while an NBA star can play 90% of a game's minutes and control every one of his team's offensive possessions. This makes team success more important to legacy because the greats have more ability to influence their team's success. If you are a real great, then your team is probably winning.

For baseball, however, the best player gets to bat only once in every 9 times, or pitch one in every 4-5 games. For hockey, the best players (outside of goalies) are usually only on the ice for 20-30 minutes in a 60 minute game. As such, individual statistics, and awards like MVP's, tend to be more important for all-time rankings. Ohtani may never have played a playoff game, but no one is going to argue that Corey Seager is the better player because of his World Series triumphs. Similarly, Connor McDavid may have never played in a Stanley Cup Finals, but he's still the consensus best player in the NHL. || I agree here and I will add his minutes are now being staggered with Kyrie (when healthy) who is also an elite on ball shot creator. So Luka liability defensively and in transition hurts him and then when he goes to the bench there isn’t as large of a drop off to his “replacement” as there are for the others || On-offs are heavily driven by your backup. Luka has consistently had Brunson, Dinwiddie and now Kyrie as his backups. Most teams don’t have a good backup for their stars. As for why the on rating isn’t as good, it think it’s fairly simple. The Mavs aren’t that great of a team. || It's not meaningless at all. Qbs are the most important position in the league, and always more valuable. No one gers disqualified, they just aren't valuable enough to win. It means so much for QB legacy || Cope, Kyrie does not come off the bench for luka, yes, some of their minutes are staggered but that’s done for every team w multiple stars || we hear that a lot about players with mediocre to bad on-offs but i dont think that fully explains it. its not like the minutes are perfectly split between luka and kyrie, and its not like all guys with great on-offs have horrible backups.

it would take looking at the mavs play on a possession-by-possession basis to really break down what's happening differently on the court || Does it though? Brady only has 3 MVPs to Peyton’s 5, and Rodgers 4. Matt Ryan and Cam Newton both won one. It doesn’t really seem to impact player legacy and is more just QB on the best team award. || Yes I’m aware I’m saying his game mimics Luka more than other stars with staggered minutes. 


Staggering Giannis and Dame still leads to a dramatic change of play. Same with Jokic and Murray or Embiid and Maxey. Luka and Kyrie have the most similar usage of the two man pairings and the least defensive impact. || Yeah transition defense is often the culprit behind certain stars having worse impact stats than most people’s eye test indicates.

The average possession where you play solid defense is only worth some small fraction of a point since the other team can get an easy look if one or more of your teammates messes up, or they can just score despite the solid defense because it’s the NBA and players are good. That means any play where you’re giving the opposing team a 5-on-4 is enough to single-handedly wipe out several solid defensive possessions. Transition offense is so much more efficient than halfcourt offense that for any play where someone doesn’t get back on defense, their team would’ve been better off trying to defend a halfcourt possession with you or me in the lineup in that player’s place.

I’m sure in Luka’s case you could point to more egregious examples where he’s arguing with the ref and not even trying to get back, but there are more subtle tendencies like fully extending yourself to try to convert a layup, taking a shot when you don’t have teammates in position to challenge for an offensive rebound, or being more likely to commit live ball rather than dead ball turnovers that also add up to give the opponent more fast breaks.

Another underrated aspect is simply free throw shooting. Luka is actually having a career-best free throw shooting year, but even then someone like SGA is scoring an extra 1.3 points per game from the line while both are attempting about the same number of free throws per game. This is completely ‘free’ extra value where once you’re at the line, it’s not like the additional points you score come at the cost of scoring opportunities for your teammates. || You act like 3 is only a bit. You must not pay attention to the nfl if you think it doesn't matter. 2015 Newton is the only reason why he any sort of legacy at all. || I’d argue tatum and brown, kawhi and george, are stars w pretty similar roles off the top pf my head. But saying luka and kyrie play staggered minutes as an excuse for his poor on/off stats is misleading because they start the game together, end the game together, and more often than not play significant minutes together, like any other team w multiple stars || Agreed. They aren’t on the list so I was comparing the available. I’m saying it’s a contributing factor in addition to the ones that were already mentioned above like Defense etc",0.0,0.81,0.19,0.4574,0.0,0.975,0.025,0.8478,0.084,0.722,0.193,0.9998

In terms of star guards developed in the East, we only have:

*  Trae Young
* Tyrese Maxey
* Kyrie Irving

Whereas the West produced a plethora of talented guards like Shai, Luka, Steph, Harden, Booker, Ja, Jamal, Lillard, Brunson, Mitchell, Fox, Ant, Russ, etc. etc. And it's not just a recent trend. Going through the list of superstar guards in the past two decades, only Wade and Iverson are bona fide superstars. You can maybe count Kyrie and Rose although the latter's career was derailed by injuries. Is it a coincidence that West produces an overwhelmingly larger number of star guards than East or is there a reason behind this?

He’s consistently been on the forefront of finding good guards. He’s worked primarily in the west, building connections in several front offices. I can’t think of a similar figure in the east teams. || Just in general the East as a whole has been bad for the past two decades. So that’s an easy explanation. Bad owners who don’t care and so don’t invest in scouting or development. But also you’re just forgetting a lot of guys so it’s not as unbalanced as you think. 

Richard Hamilton, Paul Pierce, VC, Billups, Arenas, Wall, Beal, Joe Johnson, Rondo, Lowry, DeRozan and Baron Davis. I’m sure there’s more I’m forgetting plus guys like Michael Redd who had flashes. Also a big one you’re missing is Chris Paul (Hornets were in the East then). Top 5 PG of all time came out of the East in your time frame. 

Edit: CPs first year was also the Hornets first year in West. Thanks for the correction. 

You also have guys like Halliburton and Brunson now who technically started in the west but blossomed in the east. So I am not sure that really counts for the west. || [removed] || The west tends to be the deeper conference in terms of okay to good teams.  Both conferences have about the same number of bad teams and great teams.  This creates a situation where bad teams in the east are making the 7th or 8th seed & getting playoff draft slots when better Western teams are getting lottery picks.  Usually the difference between the 12th or 16th draft pick isn't a big deal, but sometimes it matter, and over time the west has an advantage in talent acquisition. || Eastern US is older, and dominated more by Old Money. Old Money doesn't give a shit about being on the bleeding edge of tech, stats, competitiveness and they treat their teams as status symbols

Western US is new money, tech, etc.. these owners are more competitive, bigger risk takers, and always looking for an edge || Elite guard draft picks, 2010 onward:

2010: John Wall (East), Paul George (Both)
2011: Kyrie Irving (East), Klay Thompson (West), Kemba Walker (East), Isaiah Thomas (East)
2012: Damian Lillard (West), Bradley Beal (East)
2013: Victor Oladipo (East), CJ McCollum (West)
2014: Zach LaVine (East)
2015: D'Angelo Russell (Both), Devin Booker (West)
2016: Jaylen Brown (East), Dejounte Murray (Both), Jamal Murray (West)

2018: Luka Doncic (West), Trae Young (East), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (West), Jalen Brunson (Both)
2019: Ja Morant (West), Darius Garland (East)
2020: LaMelo Ball (East), Anthony Edwards (West), Tyrese Haliburton (East)
2021: Cade Cunningham (East)


West - 10
East - 13
Both - 4

So in terms of quantity, it's actually the east that wins. The real reason western guards feel so much more superior is thanks to their top-end talent. These are what I would consider as the Top-2 guards of every season, 2010 onwards:

2010: Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant
2011: Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant
2012: Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant
2013: Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant
2014: Chris Paul, Stephen Curry
2015: Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook
2016: Stephen Curry, James Harden
2017: Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook
2018: Stephen Curry, James Harden
2019: Stephen Curry, James Harden
2020: Damian Lillard, James Harden
2021: Stephen Curry, James Harden
2022: Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic
2023: Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic

Out of all these players, 2021 James Harden was the only one in the east, AND he was traded from Houston mid-season.

The east never lacked talent, the west just always had the 2 best ones. || Almost certainly just small sample size. I haven't given any thought to whether you missed any top guards in the East, and to some extent who is categorized as a guard vs forward is random (Tatum for example could be a guard in my mind, or Jimmy Butler). But taking your hypothesis for fact, it's just a small sample size artifact in my mind. || I’ve said it before, Lebron wouldn’t have those rings if he didn’t play in weak East with a super team.

The Mickey Mouse ring I don’t count either.

It’s funny people give him a pass but they take credit away from Durant for his rings with warriors || I think if you are a player that can pick the destination the New York, Miami, and maybe Atlanta are realistically the only “destination” spots. The state of California alone trumps that. 

East coast is a lot different than the west coast. By volume the west should get the highest volume of players that choose to be there. 

East might create more bigs so theoretically it could be a climate affecting your game. That’s why a lot of natural shooters come out of Cali and dues who can dribble and finish inside paint come more from New York. 

There may be some cultural impact of the coasts but I would imagine it’s just luck for the most part || Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, John Wall, Bradley Beal, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry (although he started out West he became a star in Toronto), Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton

Then going further back you had Iverson, Vince Carter, McGrady, Penny Hardaway, Ray Allen, of course MJ, Isiah Thomas, Mark Price, Joe Dumars, Adrian Dantley, Gilbert Arenas

Just a few of the star guards out East that disprove your point. The East and West are closer in terms of guard talent than you think historically. It's just that the West since the 2000s has had better ownership, management and draft luck than the East. || The Eastern conference plays a muktop really crappy form of basketball. It is touted for defense but really it's more of a product of offensive inefficiency and lack of skill. The guard play in East is less than stellar.  || Jordan, Wade, Iverson, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Kidd, Kyrie, Billups, Hardaway, other Hardaway, Trae, Haliburton, Lowry, Rondo, Beal, Wall, Baron Davis, Rip Hamilton, Arenas, DeRozan all spent large amounts of time in the East. Not saying they stack up as much as the West, but when you also look at the overall talent of the West vs the East, they aren’t bad at all. || I think he's had a lot to do with the Warriors and Clippers recent success and was obviously instrumental during his Lakers tenure and time in Memphis putting together grit and grind with Conley there too. || Iirc new orleans hornets was in the west || Player above all of them guard wise in the east, Dwyane Wade. || Yeah when the West was significantly stronger than the East it also meant that the worst teams in the West would A) have an easier time losing enough to get high draft picks and B) be less likely to trade away picks due to the belief they were only one player away from a playoff run. I remember looking it up once but it was definitely 60+ percent of top-3 picks over a long timeframe that were made by West teams. || Brunson blossomed in Dallas, with his real breakthrough to stardom on the WCF run in 2021. He hasn't changed much from last year of Dallas to his time in NY, he just got a bigger role, sole control and more usage/shot attempts when he got away from playing next to Luka. He started older than most rookies and I think he came to NY pretty fully developed. 

As a Dallas fan, the big surprise was that he maintained how good he was even without Luka while becoming the primary focus of defensive attention and taking on a bigger workload. || Some of those players listed aren’t necessarily guards primarily such as VC || Yep. Lebron wouldn’t have those rings if he didn’t form a super team in the weak East.

Dirks 1 ring is worth more than his super team and Mickey Mouse ring || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || It’s also why Embid is averaging 36.

That and the best whistle in the league. You can’t tell me the back to back games he has vs Pistons/Wizards which are historically bad teams don’t help his stats || Oh you’re right. Their first year was CP’s rookie year.  I’ll edit that. Thanks. || Yeah I agree. OP mentions Wade though. I also debated Arenas as mentioning but I guess he technically counts as getting his start in the west. Just two years though. || Hasn’t changed much? He was nowhere near the player he is now in Dallas.

He didn’t really show full potential until the WCF and by then he was leaving anyways 

Charles Barkley and many others said no one thought he’d be this good, which is correct. 

Even Knicks fans thought they were overpaying for him T the time || It’s funny bc I left out McGrady because in my mind I consider him a SF. But in my mind I consider Vince a SG. If you look at their bball ref pages they get both are listed as SGs more often than SFs. Joe Johnson probably also fits there but I also checked. I think Pierce is the only one that’s definitely leans more SF than SG. But point taken for sure. A lot just comes down to semantics. || Pierce is the only person listed primarily as a forward. Everyone else is a guard until later years like vc who obviously slowed down. || They were established 2002. CPs rookie year was displaced to OKC in 2005. || As a Dallas fan, I knew he was this good. I just didn't know whether it was sustainable when not next to Luka. The field goal attempts went up, naturally, so his total scoring did but his success is not surprising. As a Dallas fan, I wanted to match or beat NY's money with an extra year. || Yeah. They started in the east though. Realigned so their first in the west was the same year as Paul’s rookie. || Hmmm.

They are 5th in the nba in ppg per 100 with 120.2. They are 3rd in the NBA in 3P% and 3rd as well in 2P%. They are 2nd in FT%. They are 3rd in the nba in effective field goal%, and 2nd in true shooting, and 5th in offensive rating. Their assist numbers are middling (14th) and a tad worrying. They only have 3 players over  3 assists per game, Shai, Jalen, and Josh Giddey, and Josh is the only one id describe as pass first. Josh having a significant down season, playing poorer defense and shooting 45% with no perimeter shot to his game, hurts them as they cant play him the minutes they probably should to have his playmaking. Despite that, They have balanced scoring, including the obvious superstar mvp candidate in Shai, but also Jalen Williams, who is shooting an absurd 45(!!!) percent from 3, albeit on only 3 attempts per game, and 53% overall. Chet Holmgren shooting 38% from 3 and 52% overall. 

But thats only on offense. 

On defense they are similarly elite, allowing the #1 lowest fg% in the nba at 45%. They allow the 5th least points in the nba per 100 at 112.4, the only team in the top 5 in both for and against points. They are #2 in steals (including league steal leader Shai gilgeous alexander) and #3 in blocks. They allow the 3rd lowest opponent efg% Their skill at defending the interior has lead to teams avoiding that area, shooting the least amount of 2pointers against them then any other team, necessitating other teams shoot from the perimeter, a more volatile offense


A possible issue they have (that could also not end up being an issue) is their youth- they roster a grand total of 4 players over the age of 25, who, combined, have played 1102 minutes (for reference shai alone has 1615).

That isn't happening in the playoffs and I truly believe they're much better than any other team in the league || Most pundits and bettors are skeptical because the Thunder are young and lack playoff experience. That said, only the Nuggets (reigning champs), Clippers (full of veteran stars with playoff experience), and Suns (not quite as many veteran stars as the Clippers, but still more than the Thunder) are considered better bets out West. 

Bettors are also skeptical of the Timberwolves even though they aren't as young as the Thunder. The Timberwolves' veteran stars haven't had a lot of success in the playoffs.

Bettors were skeptical of the Nuggets until last year, when they won the championships. In short, bettors believe that past playoff success improves the chances of future playoff success. They like to see past winners (Jokic, Leonard, Durant) on a top team. || I always look for precedent. And I will never bet on a young team to win an NBA title. Even getting to finals is tough, but you do have some precedent with 95 Magic or the 2012 Thunder. But those are two outlier in how many years? 

SGA is their oldest player on the team with any significant minutes. He is 25. 

They have two 30 year olds that are not big contributers. 

Even the young superstar champions had key veterans on their teams. Bird had Tiny Archibald, Magic obviously had Kareem, and Duncan had Robinson. Warriors added Bogut and Iggy to their core. 

I wouldn't bet on them beating the Nuggets. Hell, I can easily see Lebron/AD pulling a first round upset if that matchup happens. || I’m going the other way and saying they have basically no chance to win the west, let alone a title. They’re a team on the come-up for sure, but they’re very young (young teams almost never win it all), they have next to zero real playoff experience (a huge factor), and the Nuggets and possibly Clippers are just flat out better. || Denver gonna big boy them if they meet in the playoffs. OKC is too small when things slow down and every rebound matters. It's the Nuggets until someone figures out how to stop Jokic and stop all the guys he can pass to at the same time. || No team has won a championship with as little playoff experience as the Thunder but no team as young as the Thunder have been this good || I would say no. The thunder have a very bright future and will be contenders for years to come but it’s just impossible for me to take a team that’s never been to playoffs seriously. There will be plenty of years where having them as favorites will be a smart call but I’d like to see them win at least one singular series before I hop on the ol bandwagon || It’s hard to quantify and it’s pretty much strictly “vibes” based, but this thunder team strikes me as young enough not to care that they’re too young to be this good. They’re interesting too since in a sense they’re a gen z team that grew up with a different culture of youth basketball compared to some of the older teams.

That being said, I don’t think they can get past the nuggets as they’ve struggled against big teams before. If they got put in a first round series against the lakers, I would even put money on the lakers tbh. But against the clippers, suns and t-wolves I wouldn’t be surprised if they were able to beat those teams in a 7 game series || I'd love to see them tap into their trove of picks and get a veteran big with playoff experience. AD would be the most ideal. Of course, he's untouchable, but with the Lakers as bad as they are, and if there's any validity to the LeBron trade discussion rumors, maybe a trove of frp would get the Lakers to budge. Something along the lines of 4-5frp + a young player. Basically the Thunder can afford to overpay.


Lauri is another potential target. A much cheaper and realistic option is Jerami Grant, but they probably don't want his salary on the books when it's time to give extensions to their young core. || Probably not... There was not a Nerd or computer that didn't love the Celtics a couple yrs. ago. Then they ran into a Vetran, battle tested Warriors team and it was a wrap. There's a reason ""Moneyball"" only works in the regular season. || No one is the favorite unless they’ve been to the promiseland before.. the reality is they are young and inexperienced and haven’t even been to the finals.. you don’t get to be a favorite unless you’ve at least been to the finals one time || I see vibes of the 2010 or 2011 Thunder, who both lost to eventual champion in 6 games. They’re very good but not quite there yet. || depends on if you believe in things that aren’t supported by metrics and numbers. i personally do but it’s all dependent on philosophy. would you rather have lebron or tatum in a game 5 2-2? i don’t know the analytics off the top of my head but i’m taking lebron 10/10 times because he’s been there and delivered so many times. || Can’t be Thunder for a few years. Anything can happen but Denver looks positioned to exploit their interior weakness and so does Minnesota. Jokic is gonna feast on Chet in playoffs (he would for all really) coz Chet’s worst moments have been against strong or highly determined big men (especially during bully ball)

SGA will be elite but idk if it’s enough. I think clips could even eliminate them too by pure fire power.

This season I would go: Denver, clips, wolves of OKC regardless of seeding || They are the clear, overwhelming favorites to win the West imo, and the most likely team to win the Finals as well. People put way too much stock into these analytics, they almost never accurately predict playoff success. Playoff experience matters a ton, and having the best player in any given series matters a ton. Nuggets have both. OKC has never won a playoff series.

I'm a massive Thunder believer that predicted them to make the conference finals before the season even started, but they're not beating Denver in a 7 game series. || I would take Denver over OKC in a seven game series. I don’t think OKC has anyone to deal with Jokic, not that any team really does, but it goes extra for OKC. I like Chet a lot, but his value doesn’t come from bangin with the bigs. I wouldn’t be surprised if they made a trade for maybe Poetl or someone like that, to soak up some of those minutes at the 5. || They can win it all again. But them being the fourth seed isn’t a good look. U pretty much have zero chance to actually win a chip of if u aren’t a third seed. Obv they have a much better chance to win it all than the thunder who are the first seed atm but them being the fourth seed shouldn’t paint them as overwhelming favorites no matter how much they are coasting. || Playoff experience does historically matter a lot and has a strong correlation with playoff success.  We've seen a lot of young teams underperform in the playoffs relative to their regular season performances.  Last season, we saw this happen with Memphis and Sacramento both getting upset in the first round by more-experienced, less-successful regular season teams.

So yes, for me that's the main reason OKC are not favorites.  They're in the mix, but I have them more as fringe contenders than high likelihood ones. || The thunder are fools gold, they will lose in the first round to either the lakers or warriors maybe even Mavs. They’re the Cavs west. || Also Magic got swept in the finals and Thunder lost in 5. History just says that young teams like this won’t win it all, I think they’re a second round exit but again who knows. || Yeah mavs or lakers can definitely upset them, Luka has shown he can just blow up and average 40 on a given series || I absolutely love AD to OKC which makes complete sense on so many levels, but there is just 1 issue: they don’t fix Jokic problem down low with AD on the roster. Jokic absolutely feasted on AD as primary defender because he is too big and skilled even for athletically gifted AD to bang down low.

They need a bruiser to slow him down (think Nurkic, Zubac or even Horford) as primary big body and then have Chet as weakside help. With AD on the roster they would have 2 weakside help guys, but no primary defender big enough to somewhat limit Jokic and he will dissect their defence if he is not constantly checked and made work for his points/assists. || Couldn’t agree more. The other thing is that at the end of games they will just spam Jokic / Murray PnR and generate good looks basically every time. No other team has anything remotely close to that advantage. || We will see. 

Denver goes as far as how their 2nd and third option plays. 

And I actually think Thunder, Clippers and even the mavs to a far lesser extent, have the qualities to punish Nuggets defensively in the playoffs. 

I do not believe Nuggets are making the finals this year. I do not think Murray will be the Murray from playoffs either || Top 4 teams in the west are separated by 0.5 games || It’s hard to separate how much experience matters versus the simple fact that in the playoffs your best players are available to play 40+ minutes every game if need be.

In the Lakers-Memphis series, LA had the two best players, had them both available for 100% of the games as opposed to 50-60%, and were getting an additional 15-20 minutes a night out of them (and almost as importantly, 15-20 fewer minutes out of their worst reserve players who would be worse than the Grizzlies’ reserves).

Oh and even all that ignores how the Lakers were racking up most of their losses with Westbrook on the roster and had one of the best records in the league after trading him. || In two playoff runs Murray has shown he is like that, some players just elevate their play in the playoffs and Murray and Jokic both have shown they are those type of players || Sure. But the west has been particularly weak in terms of team records this year. There is a chance that none of the top 4 reach the esteemed 40 wins before 20 losses.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"""Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""Shai"" OR ""Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""The Shai""",2024-02-11,nbadiscussion,1ap5u9h,[OC] All Hail Rudy Gobert - the Deterrence King,"Playing defense is not an easy task at any basketball level, especially at the NBA level. One player can be a huge difference maker but every player in the lineup must be on the same page with the system they’re playing, the assignment he currently has and ideally shares the same thought with his teammate.

This year’s Timberwolves managed to build that kind of defense, and they didn’t do it in a new or unseen way, they built up a system around Rudy Gobert - one of the best defensive players in the past decade - in a similar way the Jazz did before them. It took them a while to get the machine well-oiled and running smoothly under all conditions, but it’s looking scarily good this season.

## Rotations and Switches on a String

The way they managed to achieve that is by having Gobert always defend the player who is in the corner by rotating/switching off the ball very often - thus allowing Rudy to stay in the position where he is the scariest for his opponents.

Rudy has great defensive awareness, he knows where to stand, how to move, and which area to cover to be the most useful defender on the court. His synergy with Mike Conley is very visible, since he was a player he spent the most time on the court when they were both on the successful Jazz team that reached the top of the Western Conference multiple times.

Conley is a great chasing guard, he is very active when going over the screens and always manages to chase the players inside the 3-pt line thus forcing them to either run into Gobert or pull up from mid-range, both of the choices aren’t ideal, and often result in either a possession reset or a low-percentage shot.

When you add McDaniels and Edwards to the mix, who are more-than-willing defenders and have a great defensive motor, along with vastly more committed Towns, you get a defensive lineup worthy of the best in the league title (that they do hold currently). That was something that Gobert never managed to achieve with Jazz.


[Here is one segment from their recent game vs the Thunder](https://youtu.be/hRG1syup800) that caught my attention and depicts some of the points I’ve touched on already. The result of the play is a foul on Shai, but the essence of the video is how in sync everyone is. There is little to no delay when Towns is processing Rudy’s instructions on where to move, and McDaniels builds on that switch along with him by moving closer to Wiggins and putting himself into a more favorable position to dig on Shai’s drive.

[Here is another even better example](https://youtu.be/-ETrWJqgxN4) since this one also shows Conley’s in-time rotation, and then crisp switching by KAT-McDaniels finished with a great contest by Gobert.

While it may seem silly that I’m fawning over how in sync the Wolves are on these (and many other) defensive sequences, this kind of general understanding of defensive situations is very often missing in most of the teams, especially those without proper defensive mastermind.

## King of Deterrence

So if you combine this system with Gobert’s mind-blowing defensive awareness, scary size, and very good mobility for such a tall player you get constant defensive possessions in which the opponents are scared to challenge him, especially when they aren’t going full steam toward the rim.

[Here is one direct example](https://youtu.be/IVX8fuUt_nY) where Gobert forced Banchero to settle for a tough shot outside of the RA on a 1v1 drive. The same deterrence effect can be seen in the video clip from the Rockets’ game where VanVleet kicks out the ball after his drive toward the paint.

The main idea around this whole deterrence thing is that when Gobert is on the court, opponents take shots further away from the rim, and with that, they settle for lower percentage shots (more on that later).

[Deterrence table chart](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3d3dd08-efb6-401e-8e6b-405d0cae43dd_3546x3447.png)

These are the top 17 players in defended shots inside the 6 ft. I stretched it to 17 to get Wembanyama into the mix because his deterrence presence is already very vibrant. It’s scary just how good Wemby is in his rookie season.

[Mike Shearer from Basketball Poetry](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web) wrote a very in-depth text about Wemby’s defensive season just a couple of days ago so go check it out!

Now back to Rudy. His defensive dominance when he’s on the court is staggering. The opponents’ share of shots inside the restricted area is the lowest among these players when he’s on the court, and they only shoot 60.73% in the RA. But the real impact of both rim-defending and rim-deterring shows in the difference between on-off numbers.

Opponents’ FG% inside the RA increases by a whopping 7.39%, and the share of shots inside the RA increases by 6.90%. And even though Wemby is having a great season, he isn’t even close to what Rudy is doing in the segment of deterrence.

The difference between Rudy and Wemby is the same as it is between Wemby and Porzingis.

## Where Are Those Shots Going?

An almost 7% difference in the share of shots for a single zone is a pretty significant number, so let’s take a look at how are they being spread around.

[How do opponents shoot when Rudy is on/off per zone](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8377e661-1f5c-4623-9ee3-e87f7a5fa69f_3514x3339.png)

Gobert’s presence drives the opponents away from the hoop and forces them to take lower-percentage shots, with basically all of the Restricted Area shots spilling over to the rest of the paint area and the mid-range zone.

### Deterrence Chart

I’ve been playing around with trying to visualize Gobert’s impact on the court, I’m not still sure if I’m pleased with the result, or if I feel like they are 100% accurate representation since this kind of data isn’t visualized that often.

[Deterrence chart in a *shot chart style*](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dc1f439-040d-48cf-b13b-6e67d79f1100_890x968.png)

So what I’ve come up with and what I’m satisfied most with is practically a copy of the shot chart (at least the shot chart version that I usually create). The good thing about this sort of chart is that is very verbose and straightforward to interpret. If the square is blue, then the relative share is negative, if it’s red - it’s positive.

However, it’s not that easy to tell if the area is overall negative/positive in terms of changed share of shots. The restricted area is a clear net negative, but the 3-point areas aren’t that clear.

Other big issues are that there are a bunch of empty spots/bins, and a lot of total shots still come at the rim which would make the chart useless if I hadn’t clipped the data because Rudy’s presence reduces the share of shots around the hoop by 2% in a couple of bins, and that is a really big number.

I have also been playing around with some sort of [KDE plot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.kdeplot.html) that would be a bit more eye-appealing, but maybe a bit more inaccurate or rather distorted data since it creates a density function for every instance of the grid, and our grid would be a bit sparse given the current set up.

## Closing Remarks


Overall, I hope I’ve managed to pull out some interesting data that isn’t that mainstream when analyzing defense. I want to end on a note with which I’ve started the post - defense is in the end, all about the team. A small change from D’Angelo Russell to Mike Conley, a substantially more engaged Towns on the defensive side, and overall improved communication between everyone were all important factors in this defensive jump.

The Wolves managed to build a very analytical defense whose heart and soul is Rudy himself, and they are reaping the benefits of the hard work they’ve put in the process to reach this point.

Super interesting write-up man || Excellent analysis and write up. You put a lot of work into this and it shows. 

I find it really interesting that you have players like Claxton and Mobley, who are clearly elite and impactful rim defenders, actually see increases in opponents attempting shots in the paint when they are on the floor. On the other end, a player like Jokic who is not exactly having a good season in terms of opponent fg% in the paint when he is on, sees such a drop off in actual attempts in the paint against him anyway. || Great write up! Definitely appreciate it as a fan of Gobert's impact.
  
Rudy is most definitely a generational defender and statistics do back it up. It's unfortunate that the casual fan doesn't care about advanced statistics and merely watches highlights that often paint him in a negative light. That and a lot of NBA players don't appreciate his ability. Not entirely related to your data but in the same realm; Gobert has had this stigma where he's ""a liability"" if he's pulled out of the paint and/or matched up vs smaller guards. It has never been true but you'll often see casual fans bring up him defending Steph/Harden/Dame from years ago. You can also watch the actual tape (not arbitrary 5-6 highlights) but see his matchup data vs guards or watch PbP of him matched up.  That or they'd highlight the Jazz/Clippers series where Gobert was responsible for helping his perimeter players (who often couldn't stay in front of a rock) then rotate to the spacing ""big."" It'd end up leaving him in an awkward position where he'd have to make a choice. But no matter the choice, he'd be at fault to the casual fan. || Hey I just saw this and I think for visualization purposes you could divide into bigger zones || Great analysis post!  I call em ""Oh shit! Hell Nah!"" Plays.  
You can actually see this a couple times a game, where a player, even elite rim finishing players, will get in the restricted area but just change their mind mid dribble/shot, and make a tough fade away or sinply pass out. 
    
Also, you need to include Nickeil Alexander-Walker when mentioning elite perimeter defenders like McDaniels and Ant.  
NAW currently has a higher DefRating. Imo he's better at guarding smaller guards and really a beast getting around screens. It's amazing the number of elite perimeter defenders this team currently has, and they are not negative values at offense either. || Jokic is specific because Nuggets play him very high on defense, meaning that he often blitzes/hedges on screens and thus trying to kill plays on the perimeter already.

That is way the Nuggets allow really high fg% near the rim, because if opponents manage to reach the rim, there isn't a real rim defender there. || Aren’t Claxton and Mobley examples of big men who can guard on the perimeter as well be impactful at the rim. Last week Luka was praising Claxton for picking him up in the half-court. || That's true, they were, in my opinion, lacking some extra steps when defending those kinds of situations, like doing some peel switching that they did here and there, but towards the end of the regime, it seemed like everyone wasn't on the same page.

And it is very important to be on the same page and motivated, Mitchell looks more motivated in the Cavs now than in the last season for Jazz, and I'd say the same for Rudy as well. 

The intangible things that we don't see have a huge impact and are generally more important than schemes and system || That's also true.

\[Thanks for reading! As always, I've included a bunch of illustrative GIFs that [can be viewed in-context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/third-quarter-awards-for-the-2024) or at the links embedded in the article. If you're curious, here are my [Q1](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/nba-2023-24-first-quarter-awards) and [Q2](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/second-quarter-awards-for-the-2023) awards.\]

# Most Improved Player of the Quarter: Donte DiVincenzo, New York Knicks

My Most Improved Player of the Quarter is given to the player who improved the most from the first half of the season to the third quarter; this is not a reflection of the actual award, which looks at play this year compared to last year.

Usually, I try not to put too much weight on someone who simply plays more minutes and, therefore, puts up bigger numbers. Sometimes, though, those numbers get so big they can’t be ignored. In that spirit, I want to acknowledge The Big Ragu himself, Mr. Donte DiVincenzo.

DiVincenzo averaged 11/3/2 in his 22 minutes per game for the first 41 games of the season. But trading away Immanuel Quickley, Quentin Grimes, and RJ Barrett and injuries to OG Anunoby and Julius Randle opened up both minutes and shots for the taking, and DiVincenzo was ready to swipe them. His role started to expand in January before exploding in February.

For the third quarter, DiVincenzo averaged 21 points (!) in 35 minutes (!!), but that doesn’t tell the full story. DiVincenzo ramped up his three-point shooting to an absurd degree, hitting 39% of his 11.6 triples per game.

To put that in context, Steph Curry is averaging 12.1 triples per game for the season on 41% accuracy; Luka Doncic is second, putting up 10.2 attempts on 38% shooting. In other words, if DiVincenzo had been doing this all year, he’d be the second-best three-point shooter in the league. Nobody else is even close to that level of volume and accuracy.

Three-point shooting quality rarely holds as sample sizes get bigger. As someone starts jacking up more and more triples, the difficulty of those shots increases, which should drive down percentages. Not so in DiVincenzo’s case.

He is hunting triples with abandon. They’re rarely bad shots, but they certainly are aggressive. Look at him shake Herb Jones (a feat in itself!) and put up a moonball that soars juuuust past Jones’ lengthy fingertips: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/third-quarter-awards-for-the-2024)\]

DiVincenzo’s playing with the confidence of a high school Mean Girl, and he’s just as ruthless. Is he pulling up for three in a 1-on-5 situation with 21 seconds on the shot clock in the third quarter? Hell yeah, he is: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/third-quarter-awards-for-the-2024)\]

The Knicks have some fascinating rotation questions to answer when everyone returns to full health.

Shoutout to Deni Avdija, who also garnered consideration for this award (along with many others). I’ve got a lot more coming on him soon, in case you’re a sicko who wants to read about the Wizards.

# Perimeter Defensive Player of the Quarter: Kris Dunn, Utah Jazz

All season, I’ve broken the Defensive Player award into perimeter and interior categories. This reflects my belief that, while interior defensive players are way more important in the aggregate, perimeter guys deserve some shine, too.

(I have no idea what will happen with positionless All-Defensive teams this season, but there will be a lot of centers involved, I suspect.)

Perimeter defense, more than any other awards, is about feel and eye test. Box score metrics are inadequate, and advanced stats haven’t advanced our understanding of perimeter defense nearly as much as interior defense.

So if you want to pick Herb Jones, or Jalen Suggs, or Derrick White, or Alex Caruso (my winner last quarter), or any other number of worthy defensive options, be my guest. There’s little tangible ammo to argue with, much less to mount a winning campaign. And to be entirely honest, I’ve talked about most of those guys this season; I wanted to highlight the fearsome Dunn.

The on-ball stuff is what makes highlight reels. Many players pretend to play full-court defense; Dunn doesn’t pretend or play. Watch him strip De’Aaron Fox one-on-one in the backcourt here: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/third-quarter-awards-for-the-2024)\]

Dunn might be the league’s best transition defender (he inherits the crown from Draymond Green). He has an uncanny ability to get his hands on the rock as opponents start to gather, knocking it out of bounds and allowing the Jazz to set up their defense. Look at him blow up this transition play twice while his fellow Jazzmen casually jog back: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/third-quarter-awards-for-the-2024)\]

He’s one of the best at chasing foes around picks and staying attached to shooters’ hips. Watch Klay Thompson be the tail to Dunn’s dog here, as Dunn refuses to lose him around two different screens: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/third-quarter-awards-for-the-2024)\]

Outside of the occasional shoutout on The Lowe Post, Dunn doesn’t get nearly as much national recognition as his peers. Let’s all try to change that.

# Interior Defensive Player of the Quarter: Victor Wembanyama

I just wrote a whole bunch about [Wemby’s unheralded case for Defensive Player of the Year](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive), so you should have seen this coming if you saw that post a few weeks back. One quick updated stat: [Wembanyama averaged 3.9 blocks and 1.7 steals per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense?DateFrom=01/18/2024&dir=A&sort=BLK) in the third quarter, for a total of 5.6 stocks.

The players in second — Walker Kessler and Chet Holmgren — are only averaging 3.4 stocks. To be fair, Kessler played just 23 minutes per game, while Holmgren and Wemby hovered around 30. He’s had an underrated defensive season off Utah’s bench. But even normalizing for minutes, nobody is within Wemby’s zip code as a defensive playmaker.

While box-score stats aren’t everything, they sure are something when the gulf is this wide. Rudy Gobert remains the overwhelming frontrunner for the award, given his dominance and Wembanyama’s acclimatization to NBA action, but this might be the last year that anyone besides the Spur wins for a long, long time.

# Rookie of the Quarter: Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio Spurs

# Rookie I’m Talking About Instead: Brandin Podziemski, Golden State Warriors

Like I said, I’ve talked[a metric ton](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive) about [Victor Wembanyama](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/second-quarter-awards-for-the-2023) this season. What seemed like a close two-man race to start the year between Wemby and the ([outrageously good!](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/chet-holmgren-isnt-victor-wembanyama)) Chet Holmgren has become a blowout, and Wemby is getting better by the minute. [Brandon Miller is a distant but deserving third](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/brandon-miller-will-be-a-winner-dont).

But since we’ve already discussed many of the most deserving rookies, I want to highlight Brandin Podziemski, Golden State’s bulldog guard.

Before Podziemski’s back injury last week, he had usurped Klay Thompson’s place in the starting lineup. He’s certainly not the triggerman Thompson is from deep, but he stays within the offense without being gun-shy, an important distinction.

Of note: Steph Curry, Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga, and Draymond Green have played approximately 300 possessions each with Klay Thompson and Podziemski — a small sample, but not nothing. In those \~300 with Klay, the lineup has [a net rating of +8.6 points per 100 possessions](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/10/lineups?C=1373#tab-four_factors) — not bad! In the \~300 with Podziemski, the lineup is +21.2, an elite mark. Much more goes into that than Podz’s mere presence, of course, but it’s at least a directional sign that the lineup switch has been successful.

Podziemski is a ridiculous rebounder for his size. His ability to control the glass as a guard (5.8 rebounds per game and a ridiculous [15.3% defensive rebounding rate](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/5231#tab-defense_rebounding) that looks more like a power forward's stat) are part of the reason the Warriors have successfully been able to run out more lineups with Draymond Green at center this quarter. When a shot goes up, Podziemski is an attentive boxer-outer and aggressive high-pointer: \[[boring-ass video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/third-quarter-awards-for-the-2024)\]

Is that rebounding clip the lamest “highlight” I’ve ever embedded? Undoubtedly. But it’s illustrative! Look at how he checks his man, Scoot Henderson, to make sure Henderson’s not crashing the glass before ripping the ball out of the air in traffic. Textbook.

Podz is smart, feisty defensively, and an effective secondary playmaker. He can play either guard position, but he’s physically strong enough to play some small forward in a pinch. That positional versatility is important for a Warriors team that thrives on flexibility.

# Sixth Man of the Quarter: Naz Reid, Minnesota Timberwolves

Honestly, it’s an underwhelming crop of Sixth Men this quarter. My pick would have been Bogdan Bogdanovic, except he started in 10 of 20 games this quarter. The rule is that a player has to come off the bench in >50% of games played to qualify for the real award, and that’s what we’ll hold to here.

Therefore, my Sixth Man of the Quarter is Wolves big man Naz Reid.

Reid’s ability to shapeshift gives the Wolves more lineup flexibility than people realize. He can replace either Karl-Anthony Towns or Rudy Gobert, and his shooting (43% from deep on more than four attempts per game) ensures that the team can keep two bigs on the floor at all times without sacrificing spacing. Big men with legitimate shooting — not just decent accuracy on two attempts per game — are extremely rare. Big men who can shoot and hold up defensively are rarer still.

The stat line for the quarter of 12/5/1 and a block doesn’t pop, but it undersells how useful his skillset is for this Wolves team. Reid has dramatically improved defensively this season. He’s become quicker on the perimeter and a legitimate shotblocking threat in the paint. He gives the Wolves some switchability, something they don’t like to do with Gobert or Towns as often.

Reid also loves to push the ball in transition, something the Wolves don’t do a lot of otherwise ([they are last in the league in transition frequency](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/context#tab-offense_transition)). At times, the Wolves’ sometimes-stagnant offense needs his jolt of adrenaline. Reid has a nifty handle for a 6’10” guy, and he’s eager to use it: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/third-quarter-awards-for-the-2024)\]

The ideal Sixth Man is someone who can both slot into his team’s existing strengths and provide an off-speed pitch. Reid’s improved defense and aggressive mindset check both those boxes, and he takes the quarterly crown.

# Coach of the Quarter: Joe Mazzulla, Boston Celtics

The Celtics [were a league-leading 16-3 in this timeframe](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2023&seasontype=regseason&start=01/18/2024&end=10/15/2024). It was a relatively easy schedule, but the Celtics’ +14.6 net rating in this timespan is half again as good as second-place Minnesota’s +9.3.

There were statement games aplenty. Boston pantsed Golden State the other night in an epic demolition, obliterated Dallas, and even beat Miami twice. The only bad loss was to a then-surging Clippers team.

Boston has had good health and boasts the most talented rotation in the league. The latter, in particular, almost guarantees that Mazzulla won’t win the Coach of the Year award — there’s a sense from many that any Joe could have these guys atop the league. But this specific Joe’s third quarter deserves love.

Mazzulla is coaching. From bespoke offensive game plans to take advantage of individual defenses to wild Jrue-Holiday-at-center defensive lineups to some of the most elaborate switching schemes in the league, Mazzulla isn’t just sitting on his hands and watching his dudes play. He’s even calling the occasional timeout!

Most real coaching happens behind closed doors; a big part of it is personnel management and personal touch. On the outside, we can only judge coaches by results and what snippets of process we can glean. It would have been easy for the Celtics players and management to quit on Mazzulla after last season (and maybe they would have if the Heat had finished them off in four or five games). Instead, the rotation improved, the players bought in, and Mazzulla has the Celtics miles and miles ahead of the rest of the pack.

Players aren’t the only ones who improve; coaches do, too. Mazzulla has shown greater flexibility and more creativity in his second season at the helm. The playoffs, of course, are the ultimate test, but it’s hard to ask for much more from a regular season performance.

# Clutch Player of the Quarter: Max Strus, Cleveland Cavaliers

Listen, I did zero research for this. You can save all your arguments about FG% in the last few minutes of five-point games, etc. [The answer is Max Strus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNpH2RGsYws&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.basketballpoetry.com%2F&feature=emb_logo).

And while the half-court game-winner rightfully gets all the attention, he also went five-for-five from deep in the last four minutes to cap off a ridiculous Cavaliers comeback.

That’s clutch.

# Most Valuable Player of the Quarter: Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks

People have very strong opinions about MVP, and that’s great! Despite the plethora of statistical evidence people have to back their preferred candidate, at this point, it’s largely down to a matter of taste. If you’d prefer the metronomic dominance of Jokic and his eye-popping box scores, Shai’s slicing and dicing (32 points on 50/50/85 percent shooting is ridiculous), or Giannis’ steady two-way play (30 points on Shaq-like shooting while regaining his defensive form since Doc took over), that’s fine. The fun of MVP is that everyone can look at the same candidates and come to different conclusions. Jokic was my Q1 MVP, and SGA was my choice in Q2.

But in the third quarter, Doncic averaged a silly [36 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists on 52/39/79 percent shooting splits](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional?DateFrom=01%2F18%2F2024). WTF is that? While he’s comfortably the worst defender of the top MVP candidates, he even averaged 1.6 steals per game.

Advanced stats are similarly rosy. Out of the four major MVP candidates (Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Nikola Jokic), he had the[best Estimated Plus/Minus](https://dunksandthrees.com/player/1629029) for the quarter, although SGA was close behind. I asked [Neil Paine](https://neilpaine.substack.com/) to help me find Wins Above Replacement over this period, and he was gracious enough to oblige: Doncic slightly edges everyone else in WAR per game, too. Both the traditional and advanced stats usually favor Doncic for this period.

Other teams won more games during this stretch. But none of the other candidates had to deal with the bevy of injuries and trades upending half of the rotation like Dallas did.

Doncic whines too much to officials and teammates and still takes the occasional play off. It’s distasteful, at best. His 15 technical fouls this season mean he’s one away from a suspension (with more suspensions for subsequent techs a looming threat). The Mavericks, as a whole, have felt disjointed of late while losing four of their last five following a seven-game winning streak.

But Doncic is also putting up a historic combination of efficiency and volume while rebounding like prime Westbrook and putting forth career-best defensive efforts. It’s hard to put too much blame on him.

Luka is the least likely of this foursome to actually win the award for a variety of reasons, but his incredible third quarter deserves acknowledgment.

#Jaylen Brown

**Case FOR:** Jaylen's putting up good numbers on an amazing team (23/6/4 on +0.2rTS% with good defense; 26th in DPM/ 34th in EPM/ 51st in LEBRON). Boston lapping the league in team record and net rating means they'll likely get 2 All-NBA candidates and Brown's probably the 2nd biggest contributor to that plus he's likely more familiar to voters vs KP/White (Porzingis is already ineligible regardless because of games played). 

**Case AGAINST:** Boston's stacked top 6. Boston have a ludicrous +16.0 net rating with Jaylen OFF the court, which almost doesn't make any sense.

---

#Paul George

**Case FOR**: Top 15ish player, with good numbers and great defense as the clear 2nd best player on a contender (22/5/4 on +2.0rTS%; 9th in DPM/ 10th in EPM/ 27th in LEBRON).

**Case AGAINST:** His scoring game has been slightly lower volume/ less consistent than his contemporaries, which means voters may not have realised what an impactful overall season he's been having.

---

#Tyrese Haliburton

**Case FOR:** Top 10-15 player when fully healthy, great numbers on a good team (21/4/11 on +2.8rTS%; 36th in DPM/ 9th in EPM/ 7th in LEBRON). 

**Case AGAINST:** Has clearly declined since returning from injury (16/4/10 on 56TS% vs 24/4/13 on 63TS% pre-injury) and in his reduced state, the fit with new post-trade-deadline co-star Pascal Siakam has been uneven (Indiana have had a -3.3 net rating when they've shared the floor thus far). His first 33 games were amazing enough that I think he still may make it if he hits the games played requirement (he can only miss 1-2 more games IIRC).

---

#De'Aaron Fox

**Case FOR:** Top 2 player on a good team putting up decent numbers (27/4/6 on -1.1rTS%; 28th in DPM/ 20th in EPM/ 28th in LEBRON). Lineup data hints that the Kings' success may correlate more heavily with Fox's presence than Sabonis' despite Fox's relative inefficiency/inconsistency (Kings' net rating with Fox plus Sabonis = +3.9, Fox minus Sabonis = +0.2 net rating, Sabonis minus Fox = -5.5 net rating).

**Case AGAINST:** Inconsistent and inefficient scoring/'effort' the past few months have tanked his narrative juice, resulting in most of the credit for the Kings' record to be transferred to his consistent, efficient, triple-double aficionado teammate Domantas Sabonis. Kings are also flirting with the play-in, so questions might arise if they necessarily ""deserve"" 2 All-NBA players.


---

~~#Jamal Murray~~ (eliminated from All-NBA contention - games played)

~~**Case FOR**: Likely a top 20 player when taking playoffs into account. 2nd best player on a top 2 seed, putting up decent numbers (21/4/7 on +0.0rTS%; 24th in DPM/ 41st in EPM/ 56th in LEBRON). Jamal-plus-Jokic lineups are some of the best in the league (+14.5 net rating), while Jokic-minus-Jamal lineups are still great but not invincible (+7.5).~~

~~**Case AGAINST**: Inconsistent offensive output, plus lower scoring volume on average than some of his competitors. Jamal-minus-Jokic lineups have a -13.4 net rating.~~

---

#Zion Williamson

**Case FOR**: Top 2 player on a top 5 seed, putting up decent numbers (23/6/5 on +3.6rTS%; 74th in DPM/ 59th in EPM/ 169th in LEBRON) with improved defense. Has been ramping up lately too - 31/7/4 on 68TS% his last 3 games. Pels have a +2.0 net rating with Zion on the court and +1.3 with Zion minus Ingram. 

**Case AGAINST**: Pels have a +8.4 net rating with Zion off the court. Hasn't really had the narrative juice in his favour this season (wasn't voted as an All-Star) though a strong finish to the season could quickly change that.

---

#Tyrese Maxey

**Case FOR:** 2nd best player on a team which is a contender when fully healthy, putting up decent numbers (26/4/6 on -0.5rTS%; 59th in DPM/ 33rd in EPM/ 19th in LEBRON). Maxey-plus-Embiid lineups have been fantastic (+10.3 net rating), Embiid-minus-Maxey lineups have been good but not elite (+2.3 net rating), Maxey-minus-Embiid lineups are roughly neutral (-1.1 net rating), impressive given their injuries. Maxey's scoring actually [explodes](https://np.reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/1bf9alv/sixers_players_stats_with_and_without_joel_embiid/) without Embiid on the court - 20.5 -> 29.5 points per 75 on roughly similar efficiency. 

**Case AGAINST:** The Sixers are ""only"" the 8th seed atm  and have gone 10-22 without Embiid. Although, as a Sixers fan I can attest that Maxey's by far the biggest reason most of these games have been even somewhat competitive -- the team's constantly missing important players for various reasons (especially starter Melton who has been out for months), 2 other starters Tobias/Batum have turned into pumpkins without Embiid, starter-by-necessity Oubre has been solid but inefficient without Embiid, our main big man in JoJo's absence ""Bball"" Paul Reed has been mostly good but sometimes overtasked playing heavy minutes, Mo Bamba probably shouldn't be playing in the NBA, new acquisitions Buddy/ Lowry/ Payne have been decent but nothing special, etc..

---

#Victor Wembanyama

**Case FOR:** Probably already a top 20 player as a rookie, DPOY candidate, putting up strong numbers on a horrible team (21/10/3 with 1.3stl/3.4blks on -1.6rTS%; 8th in DPM/ 23rd in EPM/ 29th in LEBRON). Spurs are only regular-bad (-4.5 net rating) with Victor on the court - sporting an actually robust 71st percentile defense - while they're historically bad (-11.1 net rating) when Victor sits.

**Case AGAINST:** Plays on a horrible team. Took a while to get going, relatively weak first half of the season paired with a monster 2nd half. Voters may apply the rookie tax to him, whether unfairly or not.

---

#Bam Adebayo

**Case FOR:** Top 20ish player, top 2 player on a solid team, likely DPOY candidate, decent numbers (20/10/4 with 1.1stl/1.0blks on -1.6rTS%; 56th in DPM/ 70th in EPM/ 40th in LEBRON).

**Case AGAINST:** Most inefficient season of his career. Miami are roughly neutral (-0.4 net rating) when he's on the floor and plain bad (-3.9) when he's on the floor without Jimmy.

---

#Paolo Banchero

**Case FOR:** Best player on a top 5 seed putting up decent numbers (23/7/5 on -3.1rTS%; 154th in DPM/ 109th in EPM/ 75th in LEBRON). Magic are about neutral with Paolo on the court (-0.5 net rating) which is honestly impressive given how many injuries and rotating supporting cast members they've had.

**Case AGAINST:** The least efficient among the players in this group, and probably a level below as a passer compared to some of his fellow offensive centerpieces. Magic have a +7.5 net rating in almost 2000 possessions with Paolo off the court.

---

#Rudy Gobert

**Case FOR:** DPOY favourite, easily the best defender on by far the best defense in the league and arguably the 2nd most important player on a top 3 seed in the West, limited but useful offensive contributions (14/13/1 w 2.1 blks on +8.6rTS%; 23rd in DPM/ 42nd in EPM/ 23rd in LEBRON). 2nd highest on/off on the team among high minutes players (+5.3) after Ant (+9.4). Wolves are amazing when Ant and Gobert share the court without KAT (+14.0); they  tread water when Gobert is on the floor without Ant/KAT (-1.5 net rating) so he's still been capable of floor-raising to some degree.

**Case AGAINST:** Scoring game has regressed slightly from his Jazz days - likely only an average or slightly above/below average offensive player nowadays. Wolves have also been crushing opponents on both ends when Ant and KAT share the floor without Rudy (+14.9 net rating), though some of that is likely against bench units.",108,42,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1bgfg92/fringeey_allnba_candidates_cases_for_and_against/,2024-03-16 16:35:05,"I think it’ll be really hard to deny Boston two all NBA players, and I think there has been a national media wide recognition of how good Jaylen Brown has been recently. I would be surprised if he didn’t make it again. || Is George obviously the 2nd best player on the Clipperrs? Harden is currently ahead of him on win shares and PER - clearly a bettter defender, but I don't know that its so clear cut overall. || I think Zion and Sabonis deserve to make it but won’t because the voters will ignore team ranking to reward Steph, Lebron and AD for ‘living up to the challenge’ and playing 65 games this season after half a decade of not doing it and still (except AD) making All-NBA. || What puts Booker in the first group ? He has missed a ton of games, and is the #2 on a playin team.  || If Wemby continues to ramp it up towards the end of the season then fuck it, he's in for me. All-NBA is an individual award and he has been amazing. The fact that the Spurs aren't by far the worst team in the league is solely down to him. His lineups with Tre Jones are actually really strong as well, and the firts half of the season was clearly tanked by Point Jezza. || I think if you're looking at fringe candidates, Jarrett Allen deserves a mention:

Top ten in rebounds per game, win shares, offensive and defensive rating, and true shooting percentage; a central player on a top three team; top 25 in PER and blocks per game; 28th in VORP.

Currently 32nd in LeBron, 20th among frontcourt players (players listed ahead of him include Embiid, Kevin Love, and Johnathon Isaac)

Considering how many frontcourt players will be ineligible as a result of the 65 min. rule, I'd say he's a fringe candidate.

Edit: added LEBRON data || I think PG needs to get in

Brown will probably get in as the 2nd Boston player, and it makes sense given that Porzingis missed out because of games, otherwise it would be a tough choice.

Haliburton has had impressive first part of the season, and the only thing that has fallen off has been his 3-pt shooting since coming back from the injury. If he doesn't miss more games he could get in. || Paolo all-nba would be a pretty bad pick. He'd be a charity case because the Magic are okay in a terrible conference and he's not the best player on the team. The Magic would probably be fighting with the Lakers and Warriors for the 9/10 spot in the West || > Reminder: All-NBA teams are positionless now 

By rule yes and many voters will follow that but a bunch might not and so that may weaken the case for the fringe guards since you already have 6. 

You also didn't mention these guys but they are in my weighted boxscore so for completeness:

Alperen Sengun (63 GP but there's a special case for season ending injuries)    
Chet Holmgren  
Jarret Allen  
Damian Lillard  
Pascal Siakam || Jaylen Brown needs to be included before LBJ and AD are even considered. Also, there is no way Brown should be left off if you argue that both LBJ and AD should be All NBA, because there is no wrold where it amkes sense to have 2 players from the #10 team in the West ahead of 2 players from ther team with the best record in the NBA, by a mile. || Booker out. Brown in.

Halliburton in if he's not hurt.

Bam or Paolo third. || JB has +16 when he is off the floor because the Celtics entire team is centered around Tatum. He is the engine, and the Celtics tend to stagger Tatum and brown, so he doesn’t get to have a lot of Tatum minutes except for the beginning and end of games. 

Team plays way better when Tatum is out there. Haven’t checked the numbers but that’s the eye test. Team just well oiled when Tatum on the court. He has so much gravity and makes it so easy for the other guys. || For sure, he's peaking at the right time too, 29/6/4 on 62ts% his last 10 games so he's gonna be on voters' minds || Brown deserves it if he keeps this up. An elite two-way player. || Perfectly fair opinion, Harden's been really good... win shares and PER are just pretty bad advanced stats, as you can see here they rank near the very bottom in this list here showing what NBA executives/analytics staff think about publicly-available advanced stats:  https://hoopshype.com/lists/advanced-stats-nba-real-plus-minus-rapm-win-shares-analytics/

[DPM](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/DARKO/)/ [EPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm)/ [LEBRON](https://www.bball-index.com/lebron-database/) on the other hand rank 1st-3rd on the same list so I'll use them and try and give Harden the same treatment I gave the other guys...

---

**Case FOR:** 

- good numbers as the 2.5th option on a contender (17/5/8 on +5.1rTS%; 12th in DPM/ 26th on EPM/ 9th in LEBRON --- similar impact metrics to PG!). 

- LINEUP data: The Clippers are crushing opponents when their big 3 share the court (+11.2 net rating). In terms of 2-man lineups, Harden+PG lineups sans Kawhi still manage an awesome +10.7 net rating;  Harden-lone-star lineups are managing to somewhat tread water which is encouraging (-2.9 net rating, with an incredible 95th percentile offense though a 2nd percentile defense).

**Case AGAINST:** 

- strong costars/depth, so his offensive load is clearly lower than his previous seasons with the Sixers/Nets/Rockets


- LINEUP data: Kawhi-plus-PG-minus-Harden lineups have a ridiculous +19.8 net rating; while Harden+Kawhi lineups without PG are very average (-0.8 net rating); Clips are still somewhat good (+1.6) in Harden-less minutes overall. 

- He's still a negative on defense. 


- - -

In conclusion, when comparing PG and Harden, when considering that: 

- Harden's best lineups results seem to come alongside PG

- the Clips struggle with Harden+Kawhi on the floor without PG 

- Clips dominate with PG+Kawhi without Harden...

... I'd personally still have PG over Harden, but it's definitely close! || LeBron is definitely still better than both and is having a better season in terms of individual impact. He's top 10 EPM, none of the others you mentioned are. || Steph and Lebron are too old for the 65 game rule to apply right? || I feel like assuming he hits the games limit  - he can afford to miss 2 more games I believe - he'll probably make a team, he's got great numbers when healthy: 27/4/7 on +2.7rTS%; 14th in DPM/ 11th in EPM/ 16th in LEBRON; Suns have a strong +6.8 net rating in Booker-minus-KD minutes which is some crazy impressive floor-raising considering how top-heavily the Suns are constructed (if you're curious they're decent but not as impressive +2.3 in KD minus Book mins)

Book's also a playoff performer and clear top 10ish player that I believe voters may likely defer to over some of his younger less proven counterparts

That being said if the Suns slide in the standings (or if he misses 3 more games) he's probably not getting it so very fair point || Spurs are somehow worse this year than last aren’t they? || Good call! Cavs likely deserve a candidate with their record but Mitchell's out of the running (games played) and Allen has clearly been their 2nd best player.

**Case FOR:** 

- Defensive anchor, probably deserves some DPOY consideration, considering he's been anchoring the number 2 defense in the league without Evan Mobley for most of the season - Cavs have an 80th percentile defense with Allen on the court minus Mobley (87th percentile with both)

- helpful offensive production (16/11/3 w 1.2blks on +7.6rTS%; 31st in DPM/ 64th in EPM/ 32nd in LEBRON - similar impact metric footprint to Jaylen Brown & Jamal Murray). 

- Cleveland are cooking opponents when Mitchell & Allen share the court (+9.4 net rating), and Allen manages to keep them afloat when Mitchell sits (-0.9 net rating) which is impressive.

**Case AGAINST**: 

- Slight mark against him could be the Mitchell-minus-Allen lineups humming along just fine without him (+7.5 net rating) though some of that is likely against bench units so should be taken with a grain of salt.

- Better than Gobert offensively but still more limited on that end compared to most of his competitors for these spots || Just curious, who do you think is the best player on the Orlando Magic?

To me he’s by far the best player but maybe u feel Franz is the best? || Yep, it's ridiculous that he gets a pass on all his weaknesses. He gets consideration for so many accolades, that it's almost Julius Randle-eqsue. || > there’s a special case for season ending injuries

Since when? || I hope Hali doesn’t get it just because of his outspoken hate for the 65 game rule and forcing himself to play to meet it and playing poorly. It would be so ironic if he played poor and cost his team wins instead of just healing up…. All so he could make 240M instead of 200M but doesn’t get it anyways lol || Brown deserves it, period, based on his play all year.

Again, if people can justify AD and LBJ being All NBA, then there should be zero chance that Boston doesn't get 2 as well. || Wow, metrics of metrics (albeit subjective)! I just was curious about the comparison this season and found the 2 overall stats that bball ref displays. I'm guessing part of the problem with Harden is that not only is he bad at aspects of defense, he's well known to be bad, so targeting him is an popular and effective strategy. || There is an inherent problem with using any specific advanced stat as a catch all metric to decide top player lists like some fans do. These statistics are marketed as player comparison stats to attract more views but are best used with an understanding of their flaws to get contextual filtered data on specific questions (for instance, compared to the players past seasons, players with a style extremely similar to them etc.).

They are useless in a comparison of like say, an elite No.3 like Jrue Holiday Vs a good No.2 like Jaylen Brown Vs an average No.1 like Trae Young. The defensive attention, the defensive and playmaking responsibilities, off ball responsibilities etc are just too different to directly compare their stats. They cannot think for you.

To give an example of why advanced metrics are a flawed method to determine a pseudo power ranking of players, this piece has NBA execs weigh in on the most and least reliable advanced numbers based on what they use and PER was the worst out of the 11 stats surveyed. DARKO was the best rated. (https://hoopshype.com/lists/advanced-stats-nba-real-plus-minus-rapm-win-shares-analytics/)

As per DARKO, the All-NBA first team for 2022-23 would be Embiid, Giannis, Tatum, Holiday and Curry.

As per the second best rated system by execs, EPM, the first team for 2022-23 would be Jokic, Dame, Butler, Kawhi and Luka.

As per the third best rated system by execs, LEBRON, the first team for 2022-23 would be Jokic, Giannis, Butler, Mitchell and Luka.

So we can see that even the 3 most trusted advanced stats by teams has not a single player who make all 3 lists under the 1C-2F-2G system. The human media voters however flawed are not idiots and rightly pick Giannis almost unanimously as a first team forward, at the very least. || I didn’t know there was a age limit for it. Is there? || > clear top 10ish

I mean you listed him 12th not counting some injured people that would 100% go above him and you also cited 3 statistics that all had him outside the top 10 (and I think going back to last year doesn't help).

I agree it's a broad tier and precisely ranking them is a fools errand but I think a better description is Top 15-ish. || I think we all need to be honest with ourselves and agree Joseph Howarth Ingles remains the top dog. 
All Joekes aside I think it's hard to argue against Paolo being number 1 based on overall numbers, eye test and who they rely on in the crunch, but Franz is doing amazing work and I'm wide open to any argument in that direction.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.046,0.775,0.179,0.9997,0.074,0.731,0.195,0.9998
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"""Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""Shai"" OR ""Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""The Shai""",2024-03-20,nbadiscussion,1bkg437,Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s MVP Case: A Historical Perspective Based on Scoring Accomplishments ,"The conversation around Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s (SGA) MVP candidacy has been heating up, especially considering his recent entry into an elite group of players who have managed to drop 50 or more 30-point games in a single season. This list includes basketball legends such as Michael Jordan, James Harden, Kobe Bryant, and Tracy McGrady. As the Oklahoma City Thunder vie for the 1st seed, let’s examine what this scoring achievement means for SGA’s MVP case, drawing parallels from history.

Historical Context:

When looking at the players who’ve achieved similar scoring feats, it’s essential to note their accolades during those monumental seasons:

Michael Jordan had spectacular seasons in 1986-1987 and 1988-1989, leading the league in scoring but did not win the MVP in those years, despite making the All-NBA First Team and the All-Defensive First Team.

James Harden, in the 2018-2019 season, won the scoring title with a staggering 36.1 PPG but fell short of the MVP, finishing as a finalist and making the All-NBA First Team.

Kobe Bryant, during the 2005-2006 season, won the scoring title and was an MVP runner-up, also being recognized on the All-NBA First Team and the All-Defensive First Team.

Tracy McGrady claimed the scoring title in the 2002-2003 season and was named to the All-NBA First Team, though the MVP eluded him.

Awards Summary and Implications for SGA

These players’ seasons highlight a pattern: winning a scoring title and being recognized on the All-NBA First Team are common outcomes for such offensive dominance. However, securing the MVP award in the same season is not guaranteed. The distinction of MVP often requires a blend of individual excellence and team success, among other factors.

Given this historical perspective, if the Thunder secure the 1st seed, SGA’s case for MVP could be compelling. It’s not just about the scoring feats but the significant impact on his team’s success. The narrative around SGA and the Thunder, coupled with the precedent set by past scoring leaders, could influence MVP voting.

Discussion/Questions

1. Considering the historical context, how does SGA’s season compare?

2. Can leading the Thunder to the 1st seed bolster SGA’s MVP case, despite the patterns seen with Jordan, Harden, Bryant, and McGrady?

3. How do team success and narrative play into MVP considerations alongside individual achievements?

What will SGA’s monumental season mean for his MVP candidacy, especially in light of the Thunder’s potential to finish 1 in the West???
(EDIT: LUKA IS MY MVP, just a question.)",0,23,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1bkg437/shai_gilgeousalexanders_mvp_case_a_historical/,2024-03-21 16:10:42,"I'm confused. Why are you comparing SGA to past scoring title winners? Is it because of having 50 30-point games or more in a season? Cause as far as scoring title goes, SGA has no chance at it.
Him not winning mvp will be a case of someone else having a better season than him. This last stretch of the season will be the decider. 
If he continues his scoring and leads OKC to a clear 1st seed, and he outperform his competition he can get the MVP. || Completely aside from whether SGA should win these sorts of “historical achievements” aren’t really the great indicators you think they are across generations. Doing this today vs doing this in, say, the mid 2000s are just completely different things

Like sure, I bet there’s gonna end up being a lot of guys who end up hitting more 3’s that Kyle Korver as time goes on, but a lot of them will be significantly worse shooters than korver, they just were afforded different opportunities to showcase their ability

It’s cool, fun, and something fans can look at an enjoy, but it shouldn’t be weighted in any serious way like this || If you note that in those other instances the players won the scoring title. He isn't the leading scorer and is virtually tied with Giannis for second. There are multiple historic offensive feats occuring this season alone with what Luka and Giannis are doing, not even accounting for Embiid. Therefore the significane of his offensive exploits aren't really all that helpful for his MVP case. Other than James Harden, the other instances occured during significantly slower paced eras; when Kobe scored 35.4 points per game teams only averaged 97 points per game. Defense also had more freedom to operate. He accounted for his 37% or so of his teams total points. McGrady's case is similar in this regard. 

I think the last time a scoring title winner also won a title (and MVP?) was back in the 90's when Jordan did it. These days the scoring title often goes to a player who is doing all he can to keep his team afloat, as was the case with Kobe and more recently Westbrook. || It has to be said but scoring is easier than ever. All the other guys to do this won the scoring title. SGA could finish third in points per game this season so I feel like it kinda doesn’t matter. It’s very cool he is so consistent but there are two other guys averaging the same amount or more points them him. 


It would be nice if you include where those guys finished in the standings because I definitely think that matters a lot. If the Thunder finish as the one seed it could help his case but it depends on the gap between them and whoever is second. If the Nuggets finish the season with the same amount of wins but are in second because of the tie breaker I feel like it really won’t and shouldn’t matter. If the Thunder finish with a 4/5 game gap between them a the Nuggets then it will matter. 


I think team success and narrative really matters so does reputation. SGA has a strong narrative and great team success but he is still building his reputation. 

Side note I really think we should be talking more about guys like JDUB/Chet when it comes to the Thunders jump. SGA is definitely better than last season but not by much but JDUB is definitely a lot better and having Chet has changed this team on both ends of the court. || [removed] || SGA has a case, but so do other players. If SGA wins, good for him. If he doesn't, it won't be shocking or egregious. He's not that far above the pack that not giving him the award will be some wild terrible decision. || I agree with your point regarding Korever and the progression of the 3pt shot in the game. 

This relates heavily to my point that I’ve always been making, that there is absolutely no such thing as one era being better than another. It’s about recognizing that different eras have different dynamics, rules, and conditions that shape how players might perform. Some players might  excel in one era but possibly struggle in another due to their playstyle not being “portable,” so to speak, while some other players would probably thrive across multiple eras. || This ""most 30-point games"" metric is not something I've ever heard of before this season. It seems to be a talking point that OKC fans have shifted towards to make it sound like Shai is having a historic scoring season while avoiding the subject of Luka. || Another thing about Shai- Is he a point guard? I've seen him listed at point guard and ranked sometimes as one of the best point guards in the league, but I don't think I've ever once heard anyone talk about his passing or playmaking, or seen any highlights posted of great passes or great reads. He's 17th in the NBA in assists per game at 6.4, which is okay. 

Maybe the answer is that he's a combo guard or shooting guard, and the Thunder don't really play with a point guard? 

But, as good of a scorer as he is, I can't help but notice that there's not much expected of him in terms of playmaking, especially compared to players like Jokic, and Luka Doncic. || If okc can hold onto the top spot in the west then he has to be. sga has been better in defence, his steals and deflections have been mental. Two way impact player on one of the youngest teams.

Shai is on a rookie team full of kids which are currently 1st in the west. At this point he deserves it, but the season isn’t over. || His case really dropped off. Everyone else has a better narrative at this point, and SGAs odds have been dropping steadily the last couple weeks.

Embiid would be right there with Luka if not for his injury. Is a season historic if there are 2, potentially even 3 or 4, players within the same season having similarly ""historic"" seasons?

That’s an award for a single season performance and Jokic brings a Nuggets team that is next to Wizards and Hornets in net rating with him on the bench to a top-2 net rating behind only Celtics when he is on the floor.

It’s not that SGA doesn’t have the influence on the game (like the case is for Tatum, since Celtics are SO good as a team Tatum can miss the whole season and they won’t drop out of top-3 in the East), it’s just we are comparing him (+12 ON/OFF net rating) to a generational level floor raiser in Jokic (+20 ON/OFF net rating)

You also overrate his defensive impact compared to Jokic: yes, SGA is definitely better there, but this is not a DPOY MJ type of comparison as SGA is not the primary defender on opponents best player like Kawhi or even Giannis (when he won his MVPs), he is a help defender covering spot up shooters usually. Yes, he is really good at it and gets a lot of deflections, but so does Jokic (3.5 per game for SGA, 3 for Jokic); SGA is at 3 stocks, Jokic is at 2.2. But most importantly, SGA’s defensive rating is 110.4 (+1 vs OKC with him on the bench) and Jokic defensive rating is 111.3 (+2 vs Denver with him on the bench). || I believe it’s more because Sga might be 2nd in most of these categories.

He was essentially saying he’d barbecue draymond, and said “tall skill beats small skill, small skill beats tall stiff”. While I’m not sure about him cooking a generational defender, Mchale definitely was one of the most skilled post up players in nba history.

Coming into the league as an already impactful defender, Kevin was a bit of a late bloomer offensively. He really became a problem by his 4th season, upping his volume to roughly 21.2 pts/75 on really great efficiency, +6% rts (this would be a theme throughout his prime). His scoring game centered around his elite isolation scoring game in the post and fantastic play finishing, with a little bit of putbacks trickled in.

Starting with the post ups, his most basic move which he frequently went to was a simple righty Hook that he could get off over most defenders. If the defender cut off his right he had a fadeaway to his left that was borderline unblockable as a counter. If he felt the defender overplaying his fade he’d throw a fake and slip around the defender and extend for a stationary finger roll. If the defender was stunting and baited Mchale into faking he would do a surprisingly modern move where he leans into the defender claiming space and initiating contact while taking a floater runner type shot over him. This simple yet effective bag was damn near impossible to handle for many slower footed 80s defenders, who simply weren’t disciplined enough in most cases to stand a chance, resulting in Kevin having an absurd free throw rate during his best seasons. Over a 448 game sample between ‘84 and ‘89 he had a free throw rate of .43 which for comparison harden was at .53 during all his collective Houston years.

Speaking of slower footed defenders, Kevin often turned games into 30 yard dashes with his defender where he could use his extremely underrated speed to create outlet reads for his teammates, where Dennis Johnson and Larry bird were some of the all time best in that department (even parish got in on the action sometimes). He had phenomenal hands to corral these outlets and amazing touch to finish even if a defender caught up, and would often be no further than 3-7 feet from the basket by when he was taking his attempt. Mchale was also (to my utter shock) a quite impressive ball handler in transition. Not that cute Tim Duncan “oh he’s taking the ball up this play” like he genuinely would receive an outlet and take like 3-4 dribbles to get to the rim and finish with a nice contested runner over a tall defender all in like 2 seconds real time. This is also why his defense rebounding numbers aren’t very impressive, Boston preferred the transition advantage Mchale created and also had 2 great rebounders in bird and parish.

Lastly his play finishing, where he was quick hitting and intelligent with positioning, and as mentioned has great hands to catch even some bad passes. He was intelligent and deliberate with where he placed himself to get as good a lock as possible off a lay down or entry. He’d often immediately go up with a shot after an entry which is why defenders were shook with his fakes. If he’d caught an entry and felt he didn’t have good enough positioning he pulled a classic shaq tatcic, the repost, where he’d kick it back out to get an extra few inches closer to the rim on the reseal and entry. An extremely intelligent offball player but just not in the typical flying around picks and shooting jumpers sort of way. As a side note somewhat unrelated, but his finishing bag genuinely reminds me of Shai a little bit, where he is primarily an under the rim finisher but is extremely crafty with angles, slipping around defenders with their slimmer build, often using the rim to protect the ball from a shot blocker, loved reverse layups and used every single inch of their alien wingspan.

Regarding his defense the accolades kinda speak for themselves 6 time all defensive with 3 first teams and 1 selection being a bench dude and 3rd year player. Phenomenal rim protection and quite nimble, good post defense all that good stuff. Hands didn’t translate to defections though sadly. Regarding his passing I saw literally no highlights, but I’d imagine it mostly came off of double team swing swing stuff. Low turnover player for what it’s worth he wasn’t Moses Malone out there w/ the assist/turnover.

There aren’t many guys in today’s NBA that play inside with much regularity. Draymond is a SF. He’s a generational defender because the game isn’t played inside anymore, especially back to the basket players. I’d go so far to say he’d have trouble with borderline star PFs in the 80’s and part of the 90’s. Buck Williams. Terry Cummings. Mark Aguirre. Kevin Willis. Otis Thorpe. I’m not even talking about the Malone’s and KG and Duncan and Sheed and Zach Randolph. || When I want to see top tier post play I have always put on a Mchale video.

If I remember he had some bad leg/foot problems and it basically ended his career prematurely along the fact that he probably wasn’t supposed to play heavy minutes or minutes at all in the 90s but Bias passing away and then Reggie Lewis passing away kinda ruined all that.

Thank you!!!! This is very important for everyone to realize. People talk about Kevin McHale dominating with the up-and-under, but the only reason it worked is because his righty jump hook was so deadly. That was his bread-and-butter, that was the #1 thing that defenses were worried about stopping, which opened up everything else. Without that, all his fakes and counters are completely useless.


**Elite scorers need a bread and butter. They need one specific type of shot (or family of shots) that they can get off on a regular basis, that's so effective that defenses have to compromise their position in order to stop it. Once defenses overreact to that one thing, then the elite scorer has counters to exploit it.**


Think about Curry blowing by his man because they're so scared of the three ball, or Luka making his man bite on a pump fake because they're so scared of his midrange jumper.


Elite scorers have a bread and butter. That's the thing that Jayson Tatum doesn't have. He doesn't have one specific method of scoring to create the foundation of his game. He doesn't have one type of shot that's so dominant that defenses have to overreact and it opens up the rest of his game. Without that foundation, without that bread-and-butter, all the fancy moves and counters are ultimately rendered ineffective.

Not sure he’d be the rebounder or passer love is (definitely not the shooter) but he’d create a ton of matchup issues and would be a way better defender than love, he’d actually be able to play the 5 pretty much all his minutes so he’d have an even slower footed defender on him to take advantage of with his handle

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"""Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""Shai"" OR ""Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""The Shai""",2024-04-12,nbadiscussion,1c35voq,Making The Subjective MVP Debate Objective: A Statistical MVP Ranking,"Around this time of year, with the season coming to an end and the awards debates heating up, I like to run through the stats, film etc. to see who I think is most deserving of different awards. Then a question struck me. Is there a way to take the commonly agreed upon MVP criteria, that is usually subject to opinion, and boil it down to a single number or ""MVP Score"" that everybody will agree with and have no debate over?

Obviously not. *But I did it anyway*.  


The consensus criteria for how most voters and fans judge an MVP are routinely boiled down to 5 categories

1. **Production:** Simply put, a player's stat line. What statistical load a player carries for his team is one of the biggest talking points in the debate. The game isn't just about stats, but they certainly matter.
2. **Impact:** Arguably how much ""value"" a player has boils down to the perception of how much he impacts his team's ability to win, and no MVP debate is complete without discussing it.
3. **Winning:** It's hard to separate the importance of winning from how valuable a player is. Both go hand in hand. The caliber of team you're leading factors into your MVP case.
4. **Scoring:** Although scoring is part of a player's stat line and thus falls under the ""production"" category, it is so important it also deserves its own category. The fact of the matter is scoring ability/gravity is the most individually important skill in basketball, and good scoring numbers are the one constant we've seen amongst virtually every MVP over the past 40+ years. Some defend well, some pass well, some rebound well, some shoot well. All score at a high level.
5. **Clutch:** A commonly discussed talking point amongst MVPs is the ability to close games and be a reliable player for your team in big moments of games. It's hard to be viewed as the MVP if you're not a good clutch player. Even if you're not your team's go-to shot creator down the stretch (e.g. Prime Shaq w/ LAL), you still need to be good at closing games

An honorable mention goes to a 6th category which is ""**narrative**."" Like it or not, a large part of a player's MVP case boils down to the story behind what we are seeing. I removed that from this analysis because 

1)  It is impossible to statistically quantify and the purpose of this is to be as objective as possible and remove personal opinion from the equation

2) No player really has a very strong narrative working for (or against them) in this MVP race. Think Jokic got ""robbed"" last year? Sure. Luka's dealt with a ton of injuries? Sure. Shai's leading the youngest team in the NBA? Sure. 

All can be argued, but none are controlling the MVP discussion this season, as they have in years past. So let's ignore the narratives and just focus on the stats!

Disclaimer: All of these stats are accurate as of 7 PM ET April 12th, 2024 with every team in the NBA having played *exactly* 80 games at the time of writing this. The seeding out west is 1) DEN, 2) MIN, 3) OKC, 4) LAC, 5) DAL, 6) NOP, 7) PHX, 8) SAC, 9) LAL, 10) GSW. Any changes that happen after that are not accounted for in this write-up.

# Explanation:

I decided to boil everything among the 5 categories down to one number, which is expressed as a percentage. The qualifier or ""Gold Standard"" for the percentage will be somewhat arbitrary, but it's based on what a GOAT-level season would be—something that isn't a complete 1 of 1, but also extremely difficult to attain. 

E.g. if the stat is PPG, Wilt's 50.4ppg would be way too high for a ""GOAT"" standard as only one person has ever achieved it, but 30ppg would be too low as multiple guys achieve that every year. A standard like 35ppg would be fitting. It's high enough that it's a once in an era thing, but is also achievable. So if a player's averaging 28ppg, he would be at 80% of a ""Gold Standard."" (28/35=80%). 

So with this analysis, a perfect score of 100% in a category would essentially mean a guy is having arguably the best statistical season possible, the most impactful season possible, the winningest season possible, the best scoring season possible or the most clutch season possible. And it *IS* possible for a player to be above 100% e.g. if they were averaging 36ppg in that example I just gave, they would get 102.8%, instead of being capped at 100. The qualifiers are arbitrary, but fair and I'll explain my reasoning for all of them

A player will get a % for all 5 of the statistical categories, and I will average that out to form their ""MVP Score."" I decided to not weigh these categories differently because, again, objectivity is the goal here. One person may value winning more than production, another may value scoring more than winning. Others think impact is #1. To avoid any personal opinion/bias, all categories are weighed equally to form the final number.

The 12 MVP Candidates (pulled from multiple MVP mock polls) being compared, by alphabetical order, will be

2. Anthony Edwards

# 1) Production

There are a ton of ways to measure production. Usually, most people just look at a player's PTS/RBS/AST/STL/BLK and shooting splits to decipher who has the better stat-line. A simpler way to quantify statistical production? Player Efficiency Rating or PER. I know, it's not perfect. But it's not meant to be. It's meant to take every box score contribution a player attains in a season, compare that to a league average, adjust that for pace and compact it into a reasonable number. And it does an amazing job of that. Sure, you can argue the algorithm isn't perfect. Maybe it weighs rebounds a bit heavily for your liking. But this stuff is subject to personal opinion anyway. 

What's better: 30/10/10/0.5/1 on 47/34/81 shooting or 28/7/6/3/3 on 51/38/80 shooting?

Ask 50 people and you'll get 50 different reasons for 50 different answers. At least PER takes into account all statistical contributions and adjusts for pace. And unlike stats like WS or BPM it doesn't even attempt to try to deduce impact or winning contributions from stats. It ONLY quantifies statlines.

**The Formula:** Since PER measures how much a player produces statistically per minute (technically per possession, but minutes will have to do), I decided to multiply PER by total minutes played to basically get an ""Aggregate Production Number (APN)."" Basically, how much does a player produce when he's on the court, and how much is he on the court. The standard I divided that by was working under the assumption that if a player had an all-time great PER of 32, played 38mpg and all of their team's 80 games thus far in the season (32x38x80), their APN would be 97,280. Player's APN's will be expressed as a percentage of the ""Gold Standard"" APN of 97,280

**Top 5**

1. Nikola Jokic (85.2%)
2. Giannis Antetokounmpo (78.4%)
3. Luka Doncic (75.7%)
4. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (75.6%)
5. Anthony Davis (69.1%)

# 2) Impact

Impact is difficult to quantify, but arguably the most important piece of the MVP puzzle, as ""value"" and ""impact"" are somewhat synonymous, in many people's minds.

The 3 ways I chose to quantify impact was through:

**A) On-Off Net Rating Swing:** What is the team's point differential per 100 possessions with said MVP candidate on the floor, and how much does that drop when they go to the bench. Like every stat, on-off has noise and isn't perfect. But you can't have a discussion about value without looking at a stat that compares the team with vs. without them. The ""Gold Standard"" a player's on-off was divided by was +20.0.

**B) Total Plus-Minus:** On-Off matters because it's important to see how the team changes with vs. without a player on the court, but standard plus-minus is useful for simply seeing if a team is winning a certain player's minutes, and by how much. The ""Gold Standard"" a player's +/- was divided by was +800, the equivalent to being a +10 every game and playing all 80 games.

**C) Win % Differential in games played vs. missed:** If a team is on a 60-win pace, but is 0-7 in games their MVP misses, I think we would all agree that's a very relevant thing to look at, as they're dominant with him, but play like a G-League team without him. So I simply subtracted the team's win % in games that player played, by the team's win % in games the player missed for their Win % Differential. 

I think a player needs to have missed at least 3+ games to get anything useful from this, but luckily, all MVP candidates but one (Sabonis, 80/80 GP) have missed 3 or more games. For Sabonis, I credited him for not missing a single game by treating his ""win % in games missed"" as 0%. The ""Gold Standard"" a player's Win % Differential was divided by 60%. The logic being, an 80% win team is GOAT level and a 20% win team is a lottery team effectively meaning a 60% differential is equivalent to the team being an all-time great with him, and a lottery team without him.

Although I personally am a fan, I chose not to use EPM, RAPM or any other APM models in this section as I was not looking to find a ""catch-all stat"" that quantifies impact. Just use the raw data and aggregate it into one number.

**The Formula:** I got a percentage for all 3 of the above categories and equally weighed them to form one percentage for a quantifying ""impact""

**Top 5**

1. Shai Gilgeous Alexander (67.6%)
2. Jalen Brunson (64.7%)
3. Nikola Jokic (62.9%)
4. Kawhi Leonard (39.7%)
5. Luka Doncic (39.4%)

# 3) Winning

**The Formula:**

This one was pretty straightforward. Part of a player's MVP case is how dominant the team is that they're leading. Ultimately, voters don't care how great your impact is on a garbage team. Simply qualifying how winning the team is that said MVP candidate is leading. I looked at two things

1) The team's W/L%. The ""Gold Standard"" for team win % was set at 85%, as that's effectively a 70win pace.

2) The team's rank in the NBA, by record. I decided to include this one as an addition to just win % because it's not *just* about how good your record is. It's also about how good your record is, in relation to the rest of the league. Philly's 54 wins last year worked in favor of Embiid's MVP campaign as he had the 3rd best record in the league. Compare that to the 2015-16 OKC Thunder who didn't get much MVP buzz for either of their superstars despite winning 55 games, largely because they didn't even have a top 4 record in the NBA, and were the 3-seed behind the 67w Spurs and 73w Warriors. It's easy to understand why place in the NBA matters.

For this, I inverted a player's team rank and divided it by 30. So, for example, if a player's team had the #1 record in the NBA (Tatum's Celtics), they got 30/30 (100%), if they had the #2 record in the NBA (Jokic's Nuggets), they got 29/30 (96.7%), 3rd best record is 28/30 and so on. In cases where two teams were tied with the same record, but they're in the same conference, the team that lost the tiebreaker loses 0.5. E.g. OKC and Minnesota were tied at the time of making this for the 3rd best record in the NBA and the 2-seed in the west, but Minnesota had the tiebreaker, thus Minnesota got 28/30, OKC received 27.5/30. Same for the Lakers & Kings who were also tied, but SAC held the tiebreaker.

This is essentially a ""best player on the better team"" ranking. While there's obviously way more to MVP than that, it is one of the categories we think of when we discuss the MVP.

# 4) Scoring

As I stated before - it's the most important individual skill in basketball. When it comes to qualifying scoring, there are a bunch of subjective things people like. How well can he create his own shot? Can he shoot the 3? Is he a 3-level scorer? How is his post game? And many more. But, ultimately, what it boils down to is: how often can you put the ball in the basket, and how efficiently can you do it. Volume and efficiency are the bottom line.

**The Formula:** To boil volume & efficiency down to one number, I used a stat I sometimes use for player comparison called ""True PPG."" It's simple and I'm sure I'm not the only person to think of it. Multiply ppg (volume) by TS% (efficiency) and you get True ppg.

30ppg x .60 TS% = 18 True PPG.

It's that simple. And, again, some people will argue volume is more important than efficiency, while others will argue the opposite. I weighed them equally because

1) Objectivity is the goal here. My personal opinion on which one is more important is irrelevant.

2) I would argue the only reason people think one or the other is more important is because we're used to discussing the best scorers who often have both. When looking at two relatively efficient scorers averaging 15+ ppg, you can discuss what's more important, but ultimately we all agree that most NBA players would be hyper-efficient if they only took 1 or 2 wide open, easy shots a game and most NBA players could score 30, if they were to take 45 shots a game. Neither would make you an elite scorer. It's about balance.

The ""Gold Standard"" for True PPG was set at 22.75 (equal to 35ppg on 65 TS%)

**Top 5**

1. Luka Doncic (91.9%)
2. Giannis Antetokounmpo (86.7%)
3. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (85.3%)
4. Nikola Jokic (75.9%)
5. Jalen Brunson (74.7%)

# 5) Clutch

Most basketball games are close. Around 50% of NBA games are decided by single digits and in today's NBA, no lead is safe. In the tightest moments of the game, one of the most comforting feelings as a fan (or as a teammate), is knowing your team has the best closer in the game, who is going to make big plays for you down the stretch. I think it is an inextricable part of the MVP equation. How reliable is your team's best player in close games? For those who aren't aware, the NBA defines ""clutch"" situations as times when the score is within 5 points, within the last 5 minutes of the game. All stats in this portion are derived from player ""clutch stats"" data.

**The Formula:**

To assess this, I looked at 3 and equally weighed different categories:

1) **Clutch Scoring (per 36m):** I used the True PPG stat (See formula in section 4) for a player's clutch points per 36m and their TS%. The ""Gold Standard"" I divided their clutch True PPG by was 28. Considerably higher than the standard for regular season scoring, as points per 36m tend to be much higher in the clutch, as there are so more stoppages, advances due to time outs etc. and many players shoot insanely high TS% due to all of the extra FTs.

2) **Clutch ""Impact"" (+/- per 36m):** I wanted a stat that encapsulated the team's point differential in clutch moments with their best player on the court, so for that, I used +/-. The ""Gold Standard"" for +/- per 36m was set at +30.

3) **Clutch ""Production"" (Clutch PIE):** Player Impact Estimate or PIE is essentially just an alternate (albeit somewhat lesser) version of PER. I felt it necessary to include a full production stat in the mix because, although scoring is most important when we think of a player's clutch performances, a game-saving block, rebound, steal or game-winning assist can be just as important to closing games and a player's full production in clutch moments needs to be accounted for. PIE is a simplified way to quantify that. The ""gold standard"" for Clutch PIE was set at 25.

**Top 5:**

1. Nikola Jokic (99.6%)
2. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (91.8%)
3. Luka Doncic (72.3%)
4. Jalen Brunson (72%)
5. Giannis Antetokounmpo (64.2%)

# Final MVP Scores

After adding and averaging the percentages of all 5 different categories, these are how players ranked in terms of their production, impact, winning, scoring and clutch performance.

**Top 10:**

1. Nikola Jokic | 82.6% MVP score | Top 5 in 5/5 categories | Best: Clutch & Production, Worst: Scoring
2. Shai Gilgeous Alexander | 81.3% MVP Score | Top 5 in 5/5 categories | Best: Impact, Worst: Winning & Production
3. Luka Doncic | 71.6% MVP Score | Top 5 in 4/5 Categories | Best: Scoring, Worst: Winning
4. Jalen Brunson | 69.6% MVP Score | Top 5 in 3/5 Categories | Best: Impact, Worst: Production
5. Giannis Antetokounmpo | 67.3% MVP Score | Top 5 in 3/5 categories | Best: Scoring & Production, Worst: Winning
6. Jayson Tatum | 61.4% MVP Score | Top 5 in 1/5 Categories | Best: Winning, Worst:  Impact
7. Kawhi Leonard | 60.7% MVP Score | Top 5 in 2/5 Categories | Best: Impact, Worst: Production
8. LeBron James | 55% MVP Score | Top 5 in 0/5 Categories | Best: Clutch & Scoring, Worst: Winning
9. Anthony Davis | 54.6% MVP Score | Top 5 in 0/5 Categories | Best: Production, Worst: Winning
10. Anthony Edwards | 51.2% MVP Score | Top 5 in 1/5 Categories | Best: Winning, Worst: Clutch

Important Notes: The Best/Worst categories aren't necessarily the player's ""best"" or ""worst"" attributes, it's simply their best or worst argument for MVP. E.g. Nikola Jokic is an amazing scorer, Shai & Luka are winning games, Brunson's numbers have been great, Ant hasn't been bad in the clutch etc. those are simply their ""worst"" arguments for MVP, in relation to their peers.

# Discussion

The top 3 is what I was expecting and how I believe the voting will turn out based on the straw polls. It was also my personal top 3 prior to even starting this experiment. I had Joker over SGA by a hair, although I flip-flopped on them a bit, then Luka far ahead of everybody else. I was surprised to see Brunson so high, but he is the engine for that NYK team and the whole team has been so injured around him. After further thinking, he probably won't finish top 5, but he absolutely should. I was a little shocked to see Ant so low but, realistically, his numbers are a bit behind most other candidates aside from his record, so I think it's understandable. Hard to have the best player on the best team outside of the top 5, but given how dominant Giannis has been and everything Brunson's had to do for NYK, I would be completely fine if this is how the top 5 voting turned out.

Please remain civil in all disagreements. Provide your own perspective without belittling others. Comments will be locked if necessary. || I'm looking at win shares per 48, which as far as I'm aware, is the single metric that correlates best with past MVP winners. It makes sense that it does, because it basically reflects which players are producing the most on the teams that win the most games.

There's an individual and a team component to the MVP, which almost everyone applies either consciously or not: You have to be a player who is in the top tier of individual production, and you have to lead your team to the upper echelons of the NBA, before most people will consider you an MVP candidate.

For example, Tatum's team has the most wins but his production isn't in the top tier, while Luka's production is unparalleled, but his team has struggled to reach the top tier of success. For those reasons, their MVP cases haven't been perceived as strong. Luka is making a late push as the Mavericks racked up more wins, but he's been playing at the same high level all season long.

The leader in WS/48 has been the MVP almost every year in the last 15 seasons. The years that it hasn't correlated have also been the most controversial MVP seasons - Embiid over Jokic last year, Russ over KD in 2016/17, Derrick Rose over LeBron in 2010/11.

So, what does it say this year? The top five are Jokic, Shai, Giannis, Kristaps Porzingis, and Luka.

Shai had the lead for much of the season but Jokic has surpassed him by now.

Luka is obviously hurt in this metric by his team's worse record relative to some of the other candidates, which is, in fact, why he probably won't win it. If they were the team for a whole season that they have been since the trades and since guys got healthy, Luka would probably be the MVP favorite.

Interesting that Porzingis is there- It's not surprising that someone is there from the team with the most wins by far, but the metric thinks Porzingis has contributed more than Tatum, who is #15 in the league, behind Jalen Brunson and Tyrese Haliburton.

Just food for thought - If Jokic won this year, it would be consistent with the overwhelming trend. || Person A: ""look at the 50 different ways people evaluate their MVP's! We need to come up with one perfect way that can replace all those other 50 ways once and for all""

Person B: ""look at the 51 different ways people evaluate their MVP's! We need to.....""

[(original xkcd inspiration)](https://xkcd.com/927)

I love the effort, OP. But I just couldn't help but think about this comic. All you've really done is introduce another subjective way to award MVP, haha. || What I see from Jokic is that he can do what is needed from him for the team to win. He don't look for stats, yet he manage to make great ones. 

He can be the scorer, the point guard moving the attack, the screener and move away guy... 
He is just amazingly smart on the court. He knows his strengths and he knows how and when to take advantage of each of them.  
Also knows his teammates and how to find them in the best possible situation. 
He and Gordon are impressive as well working and in synch  combo || The top-5 is exactly how I expected. This is my personal rankings at this point in the season:  

(1) Jokic  
(2) SGA*  
(3) Luka*  
(4) Brunson  
(5) Giannis*  
(6) Tatum*  

*(2) & (3) are interchangeable; (5) & (6) are interchangeable

I had Brunson at rank #5 or #6 earlier in the season, but he deserved to move up based on what I've been seeing from him lately, so he jumped ahead of Tatum and Giannis in my opinion. So I think you did a pretty good job with your analysis. || [removed] || The good: a lot of work went into it, numbers look good, solid writeup that's well formatted and explains the choices made. 

The bad: I don't like the choices -- the categories chosen, how any of them are calculated, nor how they are weighted equally. Scoring is Production so having it twice is weird. Clutch is not close to evenly weighted with other major categories in the ""consensus criteria"". Other consensus criteria are missing. A lookback to see how many historical MVPs would change would be a huge improvement.  

4/10 || I worry that your whole metric doesn't account for one thing: negative plays.   
""Efficiency"" in PER is really about how efficiently they put up positive stats, but it doesn't seem to account for the player's misses, turnovers, and points given up on the defensive end. || Great read up, great to see some love for Brunson! I think it’s gonna be either Shai or Luka this year. Jokic has gotten to the point where he’s so good he’s almost transcended the award, the same way 2016-2018 LeBron did. 

Sometimes it seems they don’t give the mvp to the objective best player in the league and more to players who’ve had a good story/are due an mvp. Shai has had a great story and Luka is due an MVP || I don't agree with the way 'Winning', 'Scoring' and 'Clutch' is calculated here but decent effort and it was fun to read.

Ranking teams by winning sounds okay on paper but you are giving way too many points for differences that come down to 1-2 points in an 82 game season. 

Your ""True PPG"" calculation for scoring gives way too much value to big guys and artificially pumps up Giannis and Jokic's numbers for having a high TS near the basket. Under this metric someone like Gobert is worth only 4~ points less than Anthony Edwards, 

The clutch section I don't even know where to start. You start with your True PPG and then go off on stats that have little to do with what most people would think of clutch. Single game +/- is one of the worst stats there is and that's basically what you are trying to do with Clutch Impact. 

PIE is a stat with completely arbitrary weightings that doesn't do a great job with defense. It's just rewriting the box score. A block is worth half a steal and an OREB is worth half a DREB for instance. This is arbitrarily done this way to try and price in the defensive risks with those moves but if there is 2 minutes left in the game a 'clutch' OREB or Block can change the entire direction of the game and PIE doesn't really capture that very well. || Doesn't number 3 contradict number 2 a bit, since in 2 it helps if your team is worse without you, and in 2 it hurts if your team is worse without you? 

Or to put it more simply, why not just use record in games the star played for number 3? || It's interesting that the rate stat of per-48 is a stronger predictor than total win shares, since (at least in theory) the leader in total win shares very literally contributed more wins to their team. But I guess it also makes sense that you'd want to reward a player for having the most impact in their time on the court, even if they're playing fewer minutes every night. || Are you sure? I recall BPM edging out WS/48 at being a better indicator for MVP. || Lol funny. And also fair. As I said in the first part, it’s impossible to make it objective. I just wanted to take the 5 most commonly discussed components of the MVP debate and find a fair way to quantify all of them instead of just looking at it from a “I think Player A is more valuable than Player B” perspective || [removed] || What is your reasoning for having Brunson over Giannis? || [removed] || Questioning others without offering your own thoughts invites a more hostile debate. Present a clear counter argument if you disagree and be open to the perspective of others. || what consensus criteria do you believe is missing? also as stated i chose to weigh everything equally to avoid any disagreement over which is most important.

as for scoring, i did explain why it was double counted tbf || Are you solely referring to the Production part of the equation? Because if so the PER equation does account for missed shots, TOs, Fouls etc. Points given up on the defensive end would factor into the impact portion and scoring efficiency would basically be “double counted” in both Scoring and Production. || appreciate it. i still think Jokic runs away with it, in large part due to many voters thinking he’s “owed” one from last year, but i think this speaks volumes about Brunson to even be in the top 4.

Also wouldn’t mind Shai or Luka win at all. SGA was my personal pick for the majority of the season || [removed] || Appreciate the constructive critique 

1) I don’t think I follow. You disagree with judging teams by W/L% and their rank in the league? If that’s something you disagree with that’s fine but it has historically been a part of the discussion 

Even in year’s past when the NBA did seeding by division rather than W/L%, being a top 2 seed was still a common talking point. The purpose of this experiment is, whether you or I disagree with the criteria, to judge objectively based on the criteria 

2) Of everybody averaging 20+ppg on 60+ TS%, the majority of them are non-bigs. The highest TS% by a 25ppg scorer was a guard. TS% is simply a measure of efficiency and ppg is simply a measure of volume. Your gripe seems to be with either TS% or weighing both equally, which is your personal opinion. 

Also, in reference to your Rudy/Ant comparison, Rudy averages 12 less ppg on +10 TS%. That’s a true PPG difference of about 5.5 which is massive. If we compare that to the “gold standard” for reference, that’s over 24%, or about 8ppg when compared to a standard of 35ppg. The real difference is 12ppg. 

A +10 TS% difference being worth about a 4pt drop off in ppg seems valid to me. You are seemingly discussing your perception of the impact their scoring has which isn’t the purpose of that category, as everything “impact” related is covered in the impact category.

3) True ppg already covered, this isn’t using single game +/-, this is using the entire season’s worth of plus minus and just doing it on a per-minute basis. Essentially net rating, but per minute instead of per possession because it’s easier to gather that data and the results will be similar regardless.

Regarding your gripes with PIE, as I acknowledged I think it’s lesser to PER. But the point here is we all have differing ideas on how to weigh a statline. 1blk being worth half a steal may seem stupid to you, but relevant to somebody else. The point is all of these single number box score stats give similar results and encapsulate all statistical production and not just scoring, to give us a bigger picture view of all clutch contributions. 

You or I thinking the algorithm isn’t perfect doesn’t change the fact that all of these things whether it be PER, Gmsc, PIE etc. all spit out similar results and are no more or less flawed than our own personal opinions || Good observation. But what you brought up is exactly the point. It doesn't contradict it; it contextualizes it.

Example: 2000-01 Lakers were 12-4 without Kobe (.75 W/L%) and were 55-11 with him (.83 W/L%). The Lakers  had an amazing team/the best player in the league playing with Kobe. Them being so good without Kobe helped his winning numbers, but severely hurt his impact numbers. The win/loss differential was less than 10% and they were a +5 Net RTG without him, +9.9 with him (A moderate +4.9 swing). So basically you have allstar-caliber impact on the best team in the world. That is a low-level MVP candidate; which is where he finished (12th in voting that year).

In contrast, in 2005-06, the Lakers didn't win a single game without Kobe. They were a horrible supporting cast. They were -8 Net RTG without Kobe. That tanked his ability to win. But because of how helpless they were without him, it skyrocketed his impact numbers as he posted a career best +12.6 on/off swing. Having all-time level impact on a 45 win 7-seed is a top 5 MVP candidate, which, again, is exactly where he finished (finished 4th in voting)

He didn't win it until 07-08 when he had MVP caliber impact on a 57-win 1-seed. There is a push & pull between winning and these other categories. Easier to have massive impact with helpless teammates, but harder to win. Easier to put up big numbers on bad teams, but harder to win, easier to put up crazy clutch numbers when you're the only one your coach can trust with the ball at the end of the game.... but harder to win etc. Just looking at record in the games the star player played doesn't fully encapsulate that. || Yeah, I'm not sure why it's the per-48 that's the strongest indicator. I'd need a better head for math to even speculate about that.

But just for fun, I looked at the leaders in total win shares. The top five goes: Jokic, Shai, Giannis, Domantas Sabonis, and Luka. 

KP drops to 23rd. The highest Celtic is Tatum at #10. || See my other reply to the other guy. Yes, I'm sure- Going back to 2008, the leaders in WS/48 and BPM have won the MVP every year except for 3 times, so they both correlate the same amount in that period.

Two of the exceptions are the same: D-Rose's MVP (both metrics say LeBron should have won) and Joel Embiid's MVP (both favor Jokic).

However, WS/48 had Kevin Durant #1 the year that Russ won MVP (although he led in BPM), while James Harden was #1 in BPM in 2018-2019 when Giannis won MVP, while Giannis led in WS/48.

I haven't done analysis further back than 2008-2009.

Jokic is #1 in both WS/48 and BPM this season. || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || The Bucks and Knicks have the exact same record right now. Giannis has a great supporting cast plus a 75th anniversary teammate in Lillard. Brunson has a mediocre supporting cast and his two best teammates missed almost half of the season, yet Brunson was able to lead the Knicks to the same record as the Bucks. Giannis has better traditional stats compared to Brunson, but Brunson has much better +/- and on/off differentials than Giannis. The Knicks are better with Brunson than the Bucks are with Giannis, which makes Brunson more ""*valuable*"" than Giannis to their respective teams. || Half Brunson team is was injured since January and he carried them to the 3/2 seed (depending on tomorrow) and Giannis’ team but Dame next to him and they compared to expectation under performed and also don’t look like they’ll be a serious issue in the play offs || Please keep your comments civil.

I’d attribute more of his offensive development to CP3 than his defensive. || As a big Kawhi guy, Shai just reminds me of a guard version of him.

[Stephen Curry](https://nbarotations.info/player/201939), for example, was doing this during the mid 2010s championship runs where he'd play the entire first quarter, sit the beginning of the 2nd, finish it off, play the whole 3rd then come in for the last 3/4 of the 4th. This was because they had a great bench to help them.  
 
[LeBron](https://nbarotations.info/player/2544) also did this during his early years + Miami tenure. As he got older, he transitioned to a more staggering around 7-8 minutes of every quarter.  

[Paul George](https://nbarotations.info/player/202331) also did this around late IND tenure and OKC tenure. Then same story as LeBron, as he got older (and more worn out), started staggering his minutes near the end of the quarter so he'd have enough energy for the end of the 4th.  
  
From what I've seen: If players tend to play the entire 1st quarter, they'd sit a larger part of the beginning of the 2nd quarter, play the majority of the 3rd and normally the beginning of the 4th they'd be sitting before closing the game out around the 7-8 min mark. As stars get older and/or team's benches become more competent, they begin staggering more end of quarter minutes. So rather than playing entire 1st quarter, they'd come out near the end of the 1st and some of the beginning of the 2nd before coming in, closing the quarter out. Play the 3rd and then repeat similar to the 1st quarter. || It's not new. Teams don't want to trot out an entire second unit for very long if they can avoid it. They'd rather put one or two starters -- ideally a primary ballhandler -- with the second unit to keep things flowing.

It's not a coincidence that the names you listed are all offensive creators. || That's not at all unusual. It's far more common for 2-3 guys to play the entire first together, so you can still get 2-3 starters out to start the 2nd with the bench unit. Bookend the halves, and see how the 3rd goes. 

You save TO's for the fourth, specifically to stretch that quarter out if it's close. If you can force the other team to call a TO, then as a player you get another rest break. 

If guys are healthy and are the type to start the season strong, you are going to play them for a couple/few more minutes a night than their average over the course of the season. If guys come on late, or a team is trying to secure playoff position later in the season, the starters are likely to play more to close the season. || Depends on the player. Definitely not driven by Embiid doing it. It is still better to pull a player out with a 1 or so to go so they can get a big stretch of non game time as rest.

[Stephen Curry](https://nbarotations.info/player/201939), for example, was doing this during the mid 2010s championship runs where he'd play the entire first quarter, sit the beginning of the 2nd, finish it off, play the whole 3rd then come in for the last 3/4 of the 4th. This was because they had a great bench to help them.  
 
[LeBron](https://nbarotations.info/player/2544) also did this during his early years + Miami tenure. As he got older, he transitioned to a more staggering around 7-8 minutes of every quarter.  

[Paul George](https://nbarotations.info/player/202331) also did this around late IND tenure and OKC tenure. Then same story as LeBron, as he got older (and more worn out), started staggering his minutes near the end of the quarter so he'd have enough energy for the end of the 4th.  
  
From what I've seen: If players tend to play the entire 1st quarter, they'd sit a larger part of the beginning of the 2nd quarter, play the majority of the 3rd and normally the beginning of the 4th they'd be sitting before closing the game out around the 7-8 min mark. As stars get older and/or team's benches become more competent, they begin staggering more end of quarter minutes. So rather than playing entire 1st quarter, they'd come out near the end of the 1st and some of the beginning of the 2nd before coming in, closing the quarter out. Play the 3rd and then repeat similar to the 1st quarter. || It's not new. Teams don't want to trot out an entire second unit for very long if they can avoid it. They'd rather put one or two starters -- ideally a primary ballhandler -- with the second unit to keep things flowing.

It's not a coincidence that the names you listed are all offensive creators. || That's not at all unusual. It's far more common for 2-3 guys to play the entire first together, so you can still get 2-3 starters out to start the 2nd with the bench unit. Bookend the halves, and see how the 3rd goes. 

You save TO's for the fourth, specifically to stretch that quarter out if it's close. If you can force the other team to call a TO, then as a player you get another rest break. 

If guys are healthy and are the type to start the season strong, you are going to play them for a couple/few more minutes a night than their average over the course of the season. If guys come on late, or a team is trying to secure playoff position later in the season, the starters are likely to play more to close the season. || Depends on the player. Definitely not driven by Embiid doing it. It is still better to pull a player out with a 1 or so to go so they can get a big stretch of non game time as rest. Then if the second team collapses early in the next quarter you can get your star back in there with a bit more rest than if they just sat the quarter time break. || You are NOT getting a free pass for insinuating James Harden is a star player. || Yeha he is a role player man its obvious duuh || Youre right, hes not a player, hes the entire system",0.0,0.69,0.31,0.2023,0.075,0.854,0.071,-0.544,0.024,0.876,0.1,0.9908

From a front-office perspective, considering the liability is vital. In this analysis, I propose **Player Net Value**, a metric that considers both the current production and the cost of an NBA player.

# Net Value Tables

[Table 1 (and explanation) - Player Net Value](https://statsurge.substack.com/i/151356041/player-net-value)

[Table 2 - Aggregate Team Ratings](https://statsurge.substack.com/i/151356041/aggregate-team-ratings)

# Key Examples

**Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (OKC):**

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is a great example of someone who would be worth more than the max contract if allowed. At the time of writing, Gilgeous-Alexander, Tatum, and Jokic all would yield more than 40% of the cap if they could. These players all have positive net value, even though they’re already paid handsomely.

**Evan Mobley (CLE):**

Mobley represents arguably the best deal in basketball: rookie contracts. Players on rookie contracts are consistently high in net value, especially after they’ve found their way into teams’ rotations. The Oklahoma City Thunder’s current roster is another great example of players out-performing their relatively small rookie deals.

**Lonnie Walker IV (no team, not in data):**

The Celtics cut Walker before the current season. Is he better than at least some of the league? Undoubtedly. Unfortunately for him though, the salary he’d require as an NBA veteran is more than the value he is projected to add. My [career trends analysis also supports this](https://statsurge.substack.com/i/149062909/player-retention-by-age-group), where we see that younger players don’t have to be as good as their older counterparts to stay in the league.

# Key Takeaways & Next Steps

Although net value isn’t a new idea by any means, this analysis is a starting point from the basketball operations perspective. Understanding optimal salary allocation, and where efficiencies can be found, is a key aspect of building a championship roster. The best teams take a patient approach while rewarding deserving players.

From the “entertainment” perspective, net value remains an interesting concept. One subsequent study could quantify the premium that small-market teams have to pay to land free agents. Another fascinating approach would be to use all-star votes, Twitter/X followers, or some other popularity metric to see if player brand recognition increases a player’s expected salary.

There are countless benefits of this approach and even more avenues to explore. This metric is just the tip of the iceberg, but one that is both effective in communicating a message and simple to understand.",59,16,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1gra5e7/oc_calculating_player_net_value/,2024-11-14 12:29:31,"Thanks for giving this a read! I don't make any money off of this, it's purely for fun.

I view this metric as a good starting point.

Glad to see this being picked up again. || Maybe I don’t understand what I’m reading but if something is evaluating Luka D and FVV as performing basically equal, isn’t something wrong with the model? || One thing I don't really understand is why predicted value and salary get weighted so evenly?  You *have* to spend money in this league, so building a roster of the dozen most ""bang for the buck"" guys is not the objective, and nor will it win you a championship.

It just yields some wonky as hell results.  Like yeah - Tari Eason is a decent player on a cheap contract, which has value.  But he should be nowhere near the value of guys like SGA or Tatum.  

My other gripe is I don't think ""predicted value"" is very accurate at all.  One Jayson Tatum is worth far more in production than two Tari Easons.  Not sure how you're calculating it, but I feel like you have to weight for metrics *only* above a baseline value.  Like, set a baseline value for each category such as 10 for points.  So Tari Eason only gets valued on 2 above that, whereas Tatum gets valued on 20 above that.  I think something along those lines will more accurately represent values. || And if you strip the roster to pay those guys then they would become more valuable due to having to do even more || Loved the model, makes sense okc and Boston are at the top of the list.

Someone even recently said that these kind of players are sort of ... Gone. And if they're here they never make it as big...except Jokic. The game evolves, i get that, but if it evolved into ""gotcha"" game in order to get fouls... Well then it lost something. I'm surprised at this crazy money going there, I'd think it should be less popular, but maybe the media/marketing (?) Machine is doing its job.

also, i realized that he shot at a much higher split during the 2020-21 season. any reason why? has his shot regressed or was the 2020 season a fluke?",77,63,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1h7rhjh/why_does_shai_take_so_many_threes/,2024-12-05 22:00:39,"The spacing he gets by being able to be a threat behind the line is what he’s hoping the add. Defenses can camp inside the line by a fair margin if he doesn’t || [removed] || [removed] || You'll notice he takes a lot more in blow outs because he's trying to practice them in relatively low risk situations to ease them into his game. It's basically an investment at this point. The more opponents respect his 3 the easier it is for him to drive because they can't play off him at the perimeter || You’ll never get better at shooting 3s in game without shooting 3s in game. He has a lot of freedom to chuck up whatever in the Thunder’s offense. Especially in a game like tonight where they steamrolled the raptors from beginning to end. As a Thunder fan, watching him shoot 10% from 3 can be kinda hard to watch. But when he has 30 points at the end of 3 quarters and a dominant win, it doesn’t matter as much. 

I hope he continues to work on it. Shai with even like a 38% 3 point shot would really elevate his game. If he was able to get it to 40%+, he could average 35+ ppg. But only time will tell || 34% on 3s is the equivalent of 50% on 2s.

People talk shit about that percentage, but it’s fine. || His coach was interviewed about it and said they want him to in the regular season to experiment and expand his game. If he adds a 3 pointer he'd be even more unguardable.

Daigneault said he can always go back to not taking threes, but they want him to use the regular season to try in an attempt to make it the next level in the playoffs. || Shai is just expanding his game to increase his ceiling. You can't get better without doing that in games || The idea of doing something is more devastating than doing it. If he is shooting 3's, the other team knows they have to defend him at the 3 point line. Say he's on the court with Caruso, the threat of Shai shooting needs to be there. If he shot 1 three a game at 40% the other team would know they don't need to guard him because he's only shooting 1 a game. So the argument would then be for him to shoot more to keep the defense honest.

That being said, he's shooting 34% from 3, it's not a bad number. I'm not sure what league average is this year, we obviously have some outliers but I know a few years ago the league average was 35%. So you're upset at him for shooting ever so slightly under league average at 6 attempts a game. His true shooting percentage is still 61.8% which puts him at 41 behind a metric shit ton of bigs but also above guys like Kyrie(45% from 3) and Tatum(37% from 3) guys who we would say are good shooters. Granted if you look at effective field goal he'd be below Kyrie. 

So the real question is why shouldn't he shoot this many 3's? Him doing so creates more space, forces the defense to guard him, he's about league average at it and the hope is probably that he'll go up back to his career average of 34.8%. I'm sure it's just small sample size but the Thunders 5 losses, Shai is averaging 2.5 less 3's a game at almost 43%! The actual record shows him shooting more 3's leads to them winning. || everyone is shooting more threes this year. that’s basically the explanation || He’s not shooting it at a bad clip, my podcast will be out tomorrow but TS % from 3 is around the 34% mark.
Not bad. It gives him another arsenal in his bag cause he goes to the rim a lot and likes the midrange. || Everyone tries to copy or adjust to beat the most recent champion.

Boston played true, completely five out and absolutely dominated doing it. Mavs got Klay for more spacing and threes. Knicks got KAT to be a stretch 4. Shai’s taking more threes. Ant’s taking more threes. || I think it’s to develop it, OKC will likely be the first seed in the west even if they spend the season joking around so to develop it he needs to take it instead of only leaning into his strengths. There are mechanical differences from his 3point shot now compared to the last 2 years so I think there will be a very strong stretch eventually where he’ll be shooting it well with good volume(5 threes a game) || Because if he is a legit 3-level scoring threat, even if the 3 pointer isn’t his MOST efficient shot, teams will have to respect it and defend against it. Meaning, defenders will have to play him tighter on the perimeter, going over screens, closing out/contesting more aggressively, which can open up lanes for him to the basket or his spot in the midrange. So improving his three will improve his offensive game at all three levels. It will also improve the team offense overall by improving spacing. Basically, Shai improving his efficiency from 3 could improve his efficiency from 2 and his overall offensive efficiency, and also improve the efficiency of the team offense as a whole.

As I said, even if it isn’t his most efficient shot, he should keep shooting them, both from an offensive strategy standpoint and from long term development of skills standpoint. || Take more threes because they're worth 50% more than twos, making them the most efficient way to score if you can shoot even moderately well. || Well he’s been an up and down shooter his entire career. When he wasn’t the main option he got a lot more catch and shoot / open threes which is why people think his 40% season is a fluke not the norm. 

And coming into today’s games he was 34.4% from three, below average for the NBA but not necessarily “bad”, but after todays horrible 3pt performance he set himself back two whole percentage points and is now at 32.6% from three on the season. For the season he went from being a “respectable threat” to “leave him open” within the span of one game. || That's nothing for a scorer of his level...

Generally speaking 30+ PPG scorers ""should"" average about 10 from 3, 10 at the rim, and 10 from the line.

Recognize the game, and be appreciative of the the generational talent. || Because apparently it's better to take shots that you're not good at, just to give the *appearance* of a threat, rather than repeatedly spam what you're good at and already unstoppable at.    
     
See the jump shots Giannis takes as well. There's zero reason for him to shoot outside of 10FT, yet he still does so a bunch of times each game. || It’s called a green light . 

A lot of coaches have a guy they give the green light to which means if they are open or feel good about it , coach wants them to send it . || Shooting 3s at a low percentage is better for him than not shooting them at all. Shooting 34% from three is still the equivalent of 51% in the midrange or at the hoop, which is still a decent enough efficiency. However, the defender knowing that Shai MIGHT shoot is so much more valuable than the defender knowing that Shai WONT shoot. It forces the defence to make a choice, defend the alright efficiency 3 pointer, or defend the drive, instead of them just being able to sag off and wait for the drive. Look at Ben Simmons, once defenders knew he wouldn’t shoot threes, his career was more or less over. Giannis took 4 threes a game, despite being awful at them, for the same reason (just in his case he’s so good at driving it doesn’t matter if the defence knows it or not, so now he’s down to 1.5 a game and is better for it). Shai’s efficiency as a whole is probably higher shooting those 3s than it would be if he never shot threes, meaning it’s beneficial to take them. || >  realized that he shot at a much higher split during the 2020-21 season. any reason why? has his shot regressed or was the 2020 season a fluke?

Tiny volume.  He played 35 games and raw numbers were 71/170.  For example, he had one game where he was 6/11 - if that one single game was 1/10 instead, he crashes all the way down from 42% to 39%.  Can't read much of anything into that 42%, particularly that he hasn't come close in 4 years.

3-point shot is notoriously erratic over a small sample size, and even year to year.  I've read numerous times that 1000 3-point shots is what you need to get an accurate read on shooting ability.  SGA has 1400 in his entire career, so I think it's safe to say to use career numbers and say he's probably right about a 34%-35% 3-point shooter. || This is the first year he's taken so many threes.  It's basically a new facet they are trying to add to his game this season to make him even more unstoppable.  It's still early, if he's still shooting 34% later in the season I would expect OKC to dial back this approach a little.  But if he ends up shooting 38% I think they'd be happy with this addition to his game.

The 2020-2021 season was basically a fluke, he's never been a big threat from 3, but his midrange game is so good it's hard not to think that he could perfect a 3-point shot and it's the biggest ""hole"" in his game so it's a somewhat obvious thing to try during the regular season. || Right now Shai is an absurdly high level 2-level scorer. Even if it is a struggle (understatement) to contain him a defense can say ""every screen we go under, give him the 3 try and take his driving angles"". It's already difficult to stop him now without a 3pt shot. Imagine how much stress a defender gets put under if Shai becomes viable. PnR - go under? He pulls up. PnR - go over? Now they're chasing him into his territory. 


Tldr. It opens up his already unstoppable game even further. || Three pointers are high value shots and being able to take them and make them at a consistent clip opens up the best parts of his game - the ability to drive and score at the basket and from the midrange. Jalen Williams is also making a pointed effort to shoot more 3s, and his efficiency has dipped . But in the long term, both players will benefit from shooting more 3s because it will make the rest of their game that much easier to get to. || Same reason Ant and Wemby is , to open it up . In a serious playoff series I see them using that space they create now to get easier down hill attacks || I think it's not too complicated.

The Thunder want to take more 3s as a whole. 

Last season they were 1st in 3 point percentage, yet failed to effectively space the floor against the Mavericks. Meanwhile the Celtics DID effectively space out the floor and punish the Mavericks larger lineups.

The difference between the two? OKC was 16th in 3 point attempts while Boston was 1st.

This season OKC is 7th in 3 point attempts though their percentage has dropped. 

Shai is not the only one shooting more 3s. Last season he shot 5.1 attempts per 100 possessions. This season he is shooting 8.8

Last season Jalen Williams shot 5.2 per 100. This season he is shooting 7.8 per 100.

Isiah Joe shot 11.7 per 100 Last season. Now he's shooting 13.7. 

Aaron Wiggins shot 4.9 per 100 Last season. Now he's shooting 8.7


Shai isn't just taking a lot more 3s, there appears to be an obvious shift in the gameplan for OKC to shoot more. || Defenders use the opposing player’s tendencies and percentages to determine how they should guard them. Shai might not have the highest percentage from 3pt but he’s an established bucket getter so the threat of him catching fire from 3 & the knowledge that he’s going to pull up if he has daylight forces defenders to commit to him when he’s outside the arch. That plays to Shai’s advantage because his sweet spots are medium to close range and it’s harder to get there when the defense is giving him space and anchoring closer to where he wants to go. I think there’s definitely a valid debate to be had about how many shots is too many but I’m here to give young players like Shai and Edwards the room to jack up bad shots in the name of development. || i was thinking that could be a reason - correct me if im wrong but after watching him play against the lakers i felt like they really left him a lot of space to shoot the 3. it looked to me like they were leaving him a lot of space and i thought most of his threes that game were relatively uncontested || Yes - it's the same reason Marcus Smart had a green line and everybody wanted Ben Simmons to take shots.

Without the threat of shooting, defenses can just ignore you on the perimeter and it makes life more difficult for the entire offense.  33% is enough to have to respect the shot, even if it's a below average 3-point shot. || We removed your comment for being low effort.

In NBA basketball, creative players who can create their own shots are undoubtedly valuable, and guards generally excel at this. However, especially in recent years, players of the type I will describe below have been overvalued, and many teams fall into this trap.


Here’s my description of the overrated (and I will explain why they are overrated) player type:
A guard, ball-dominant, usually short (6'4"" and under), a poor defender, and a good scorer.


Who are these players?


Russell Westbrook (although his prime is behind him, he was one of the best candidates for this profile at the time), Lillard, Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, James Harden, Cunningham, Bradley Beal, and the like. There are also lower-tier versions, such as Jalen Green, Collin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Malik Monk, D’angelo Russell, etc.

There have been many players of this type in history as well. From better examples like Steve Nash to others such as Starbury (Stephon Marbury), Steve Francis, Monta Ellis, Baron Davis, Gilbert Arenas, John Wall (not that bad defender but still fits the role) and many more…


The point is, no team in the modern era (and this also applies to earlier eras) has won a championship with this type of player as their number-one option. At best, they have made the Finals with very low success rates. Let’s take a look at point guards and players fitting this profile on Finals teams starting from the 1990s.


------------------

(OL means primary player / leader of offense) 


1991 - Chicago Bulls (PG John Paxson and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Los Angeles Lakers (PG Magic Johnson and OL James Worthy)
There was no such player. Paxson was a complementary piece. MJ was an exceptional defender and not small. Magic, on the other hand, was physically imposing and a pass-first player, never a scorer-first.

1992 - Chicago Bulls (PG John Paxson and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Portland Trail Blazers (PG Terry Porter and OL Clyde Drexler)
Same Chicago. For Portland, Terry Porter was a facilitator, and Drexler was the offensive leader.

1993 - Chicago Bulls (PG B.J. Armstrong and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Phoenix Suns (PG Kevin Johnson and OL Charles Barkley)
Same Chicago. KJ was the second option and not a primary scorer.

1994 - Houston Rockets (PG Kenny Smith and OL Hakeem Olajuwon) defeated New York Knicks (PG Derek Harper and OL Patrick Ewing)
Kenny was the third or even fourth offensive option. Derek Harper was similar.

1995 - Houston Rockets (PG Kenny Smith and OL Hakeem Olajuwon) defeated Orlando Magic (PG Anfernee Hardaway and OL Shaquille O’Neal)
Same Houston. Hardaway was both physically large and a pass-first player.

1996 - Chicago Bulls (PG Ron Harper and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Seattle SuperSonics (PG Gary Payton and OL Shawn Kemp)
Even with player changes, same Chicago. Gary Payton was ball-dominant but an excellent defender with no defensive liabilities.

1997 - Chicago Bulls (PG Ron Harper and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Utah Jazz (PG John Stockton and OL Karl Malone)
Same Chicago. Stockton was an exceptional facilitator, the god of pass-first players, and not a poor defender.

1998 - Chicago Bulls (PG Ron Harper and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Utah Jazz (PG John Stockton and OL Karl Malone)
Both teams remained the same.

1999 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Avery Johnson and OL Tim Duncan) defeated New York Knicks (PG Charlie Ward and OL Latrell Sprewell)
Avery Johnson was a good defender, not ball-dominant, and the fourth or fifth offensive option. Charlie Ward was similar.

2000 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Ron Harper and OL Shaquille O’Neal) defeated Indiana Pacers (PG Mark Jackson and OL Reggie Miller)
Ron Harper was perhaps the sixth option on offense, not ball-dominant, physically large, and a solid defender. Mark Jackson was pass-first, an excellent facilitator, and not scorer-first.

2001 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Shaquille O'Neal) defeated Philadelphia 76ers (PG Eric Snow and OL Allen Iverson)
Even with a player change, it was the same Lakers. Allen Iverson is one of the players I mentioned earlier, but he wasn’t as poor defensively as the others and had moved to the shooting guard position this season. They were able to make the Finals because he stopped playing as a point guard.

2002 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Shaquille O'Neal) defeated New Jersey Nets (PG Jason Kidd and OL Jason Kidd)
Same Lakers. Although I selected Kidd as the offensive leader, he was physically large, an excellent defender, and a pass-first player. He does not fit this profile.

2003 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Tim Duncan) defeated New Jersey Nets (PG Jason Kidd and OL Jason Kidd)
Parker fits this profile, but in the Spurs' excellent team system, he was never allowed to be ball-dominant as described, and he wasn’t the primary player. Same Nets.

2004 - Detroit Pistons (PG Chauncey Billups and OL Chauncey Billups) defeated Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Shaquille O'Neal)
Although Billups was the offensive leader, he wasn’t ball-dominant and was an excellent defender. Same Lakers.

2005 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Tim Duncan) defeated Detroit Pistons (PG Chauncey Billups and OL Richard Hamilton)
Same Spurs, same Pistons.

2006 - Miami Heat (PG Jason Williams and OL Dwyane Wade) defeated Dallas Mavericks (PG Jason Terry and OL Dirk Nowitzki)
Jason Williams was the fifth option on offense, while Jason Terry in Dallas was not ball-dominant, as their offense revolved around Nowitzki.

2007 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Tim Duncan) defeated Cleveland Cavaliers (PG Daniel Gibson and OL LeBron James)
Similar Spurs. Parker was more effective now, but the Spurs' system remained the same. Daniel Gibson? :)

2008 - Boston Celtics (PG Rajon Rondo and OL Paul Pierce) defeated Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Kobe Bryant)
Rondo was an excellent facilitator, pass-first, a poor scorer, and a good defender. Similar Lakers—no Shaq anymore, but Kobe is better now. Kobe was ball-dominant but physically large and a great defender.

2009 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Kobe Bryant) defeated Orlando Magic (PG Rafer Alston or Jameer Nelson and OL Dwight Howard)
Same Lakers. The two point guards I mentioned were not primary playmakers. The main playmaker was Hedo Turkoglu, a small forward standing at 6'8"".

2010 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Kobe Bryant) defeated Boston Celtics (PG Rajon Rondo and OL Paul Pierce)
Same Lakers. Same Boston.

2011 - Dallas Mavericks (PG Jason Kidd and OL Dirk Nowitzki) defeated Miami Heat (PG Mario Chalmers and OL LeBron James)
As mentioned earlier, Kidd’s role was even more reduced here. Again, LeBron—ball-dominant but physically large and an excellent defender when needed. Chalmers wasn’t even focused on being ball-dominant.

2012 - Miami Heat (PG Mario Chalmers and OL LeBron James) defeated Oklahoma City Thunder (PG Russell Westbrook and OL Kevin Durant)
Same Miami. This was the first time we saw the exact player type I described in the Finals (Westbrook). Even though, he was not primary offensive player but Durant. Harden was also on this team, but he wasn’t ball-dominant with Russ there.

2013 - Miami Heat (PG Mario Chalmers and OL LeBron James) defeated San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Tim Duncan)
Same Miami. Same Spurs.

2014 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Kawhi Leonard) defeated Miami Heat (PG Mario Chalmers and OL LeBron James)
Same for both. Parker was now even more effective, but the Spurs' system remained in place. Kawhi started to emerge as the main figure.

2015 - Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Stephen Curry) defeated Cleveland Cavaliers (PG Matthew Dellavedova and OL LeBron James)
You may have noticed that Curry doesn’t fit this profile. He is one of the rare all-time superstars who can dominate without being ball-dominant. Golden State’s system is already based on ball movement. Once again, another LeBron-led team. (I’ll talk about Kyrie next year.)

2016 - Cleveland Cavaliers (PG Kyrie Irving and OL LeBron James) defeated Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Stephen Curry)
Kyrie is an important detail here. Practically, Kyrie is the only player from this profile to win a championship as part of a title-winning team. However, even though I list Kyrie as the PG, the true playmaker was LeBron. While Kyrie was technically the starting point guard, his role was not playmaking but scoring through individual skills in tight situations. The team was not built around Kyrie. Instead, he was an excellent complementary piece and a great scorer.

2017 - Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Kevin Durant) defeated Cleveland Cavaliers (PG Kyrie Irving and OL LeBron James)
Same teams. Curry takes a step back.

2018 - Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Kevin Durant) defeated Cleveland Cavaliers (PG George Hill and OL LeBron James)
Same teams again.

2019 - Toronto Raptors (PG Kyle Lowry and OL Kawhi Leonard) defeated Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Stephen Curry)
Kyle Lowry was a solid facilitator, not a score-first player, and an excellent defender. Offensively, he was the third or, in some situations, even the fourth option. Same Golden State.

2020 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG LeBron James and OL LeBron James) defeated Miami Heat (PG Goran Dragić and OL Jimmy Butler)
Another LeBron James team versus a poor man’s LeBron James team (Butler). Dragic was the fourth offensive option.

2021 - Milwaukee Bucks (PG Jrue Holiday and OL Giannis Antetokounmpo) defeated Phoenix Suns (PG Chris Paul and OL Devin Booker)
Jrue was the third offensive option, not score-first, and an excellent defender. Chris Paul might seem to fit this profile, but he doesn’t because he is both pass-first and an exceptional facilitator and defender.

2022 - Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Stephen Curry) defeated Boston Celtics (PG Marcus Smart and OL Jayson Tatum)
Different but still the same Golden State. In Boston, no one fully took on the role of a true playmaker. Smart was essentially a big, defensive player and offensively the third or even fourth option.

2023 - Denver Nuggets (PG Jamal Murray and OL Nikola Jokić) defeated Miami Heat (PG Gabe Vincent and OL Jimmy Butler)
Everyone knows who the real playmaker is in Denver, right? On another team, Jamal Murray might have fit the profile described above. However, his ability to play off-ball alongside Jokic elevated him. Same Miami.

2024 - Boston Celtics (PG Jrue Holiday and OL Jayson Tatum) defeated Dallas Mavericks (PG Luka Dončić and OL Luka Dončić)
Same but improved Boston. Same Jrue. Luka “partially” fits this profile. However, he isn’t that small, which, despite being a poor defender, allows him to hold his own against bigger players.


-----------

As can be seen, no team with a player of the type I described has succeeded in a leading role. There are no exceptions. Only a handful of teams have even reached the Finals with such players. Even if a player of a similar profile exists on a championship team (and even this is rare), they are not in a leading role. They take on secondary, tertiary, or even lower offensive responsibilities. Another exception might be Iverson’s Philadelphia team, but even then, the key detail was Iverson transitioning to the shooting guard position, thereby reducing his ball dominance. I also reiterate that Iverson was not a terrible defender.

At one point, the Harden-led Rockets came very close to succeeding with this model. They could have become champions or at least reached the Finals, and they deserved it. However, they “didn’t.” The Golden State effect played a significant role here, but this type of player tends to wear down over extended series. You may recall Harden’s state during the closing moments of the elimination game against Golden State. Similarly, Luka’s struggles in the later stages of the playoffs have been evident for years. However, with Kyrie added to the team, they managed to reach the Finals (where Kyrie was again the secondary player). Can Luka ever win a championship as the leading player?

In my opinion, this is highly unlikely. While a rematch of last season’s Finals seems possible, I don’t think it will happen again. Even if they somehow manage it, I must reiterate that Luka doesn’t fully fit the profile of the players described above.

To summarize, the NBA has a significant number of players fitting this profile. In fact, finding pass-first American-born guards is almost impossible. Recently, Lonzo showed the ideal portrait of a point guard, but injuries interrupted his career. Garland somewhat fits this description; although he is an average or kinda weak defender, he can still play pass-first. Halliburton is  pretty weak defender but facilitator and undoubtedly a pass-first player. These two could play in the Finals or even win championships alongside elite scorers. De’Aaron Fox is also a candidate here. Over time, he has become less ball-dominant and isn’t a poor defender. Looking at it this way, Jalen Green needs to learn to play like Jamal Murray alongside Alperen Şengün. The more ball-dominant he becomes, the worse it will get, and Houston won't have a chance. On the other hand, SGA (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander) could win a championship with OKC. While he is a good scorer, he is not overly ball-dominant, and in addition to not being small, he is also an excellent defender.

The fascination with ball-dominant, scoring, poor-defending, physically small players in the NBA has led to these players being overvalued. Still, I am not claiming these players are worthless. For instance, Lillard, alongside McCollum, took his team to the Conference Finals. He kept people coming to games in Portland for years and won many games. For that reason, he is valuable.

However, he “isn’t that valuable.” He hasn’t won a championship or even reached the Finals. He never will. Perhaps one day, if he takes on a fourth or fifth role (e.g., Giannis stays in Milwaukee, the Bucks magically (!) find two elite offensie players or Middleton heals, and Lillard transitions to a pass-first role, hitting open shots, and his minutes drop to around 20 per game), he might achieve this.

I think Trae Young could succeed on the right team by tempering his scoring and ball dominance. For instance, in a Spurs team where Vassell has become an elite scorer, and Wemby is competing for the throne, Trae could find a place as an elite facilitator and third offensive option despite his terrible defense. For all the other similar players, the same formula applies. No player of this type has ever played a role on a championship-level team, nor has any of them ultimately succeeded. This is the reality of the NBA. 

In summary, it is very difficult for players of this type to reach the Finals. To achieve this, their roles must inevitably be reduced. Looking at those who have managed to do so, the viable scenarios are as follows:

* Continuing with playmaking but regressing to a second or, ideally, third offensive role (like Westbrook in the OKC Finals).

* Becoming less ball-dominant and transitioning to the shooting guard position (like Iverson or Kyrie).

* Improving their defense to eliminate being a liability, as they cannot physically grow larger (while there’s no example here, being able to at least hold their ground against certain types of players, like Luka, or Harden’s ability to do so in some cases, would suffice).


Thank you to anyone who has read this far.

- You can't win built around a shooting guard with no elite big man (until 1991)
- You can't win without a top 5 player (until 2004)
- You can't win with a jump shooting big man as a primary option (until 2011)
- You can't win with small guard who shoots a lot of threes (until 2015)
- You can't win with a big man that's not an elite rim protector (until 2023)

Versions of this were applied to individual players up until the moment they won, including Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant (as a first option). 

It reminds me of this xkcd comic on electoral precedents: https://xkcd.com/1122/

It's analysis that lacks imagination. I've never seen it happen, ergo it must not be possible. || Your initial assumptions are already flawed because you’ve already clumped together players who struggle on the other side of the floor. I think your conclusion can be, it’s harder to build with this archetype because It has been done before.

You need to back your thesis with empirical data, maybe Usage Rate for guards below 6’4. I would remove the defense part, because it would skew your data to favor the flawed conclusion in your post, and ask a question - what is the impact of one way offensive guards to winning a championship? Plenty of heavy usage guards are instrumental to winning championships, even Steve Nash was an Horry hip check away from winning.  Chris Paul is another good example. 

As for the purpose of this post, teams draft the best available player they can and hope they turn out into a good piece, and most times they turn out to be guards. Naturally, there are more guys below 6’4, and you hope for the best. If you were Detroit, would you pass on Cade (who is 6’6 btw) and say, “Data says, we can’t win around you and draft Jonathan Kuminga instead”. The Kwames, Darkos and Bargiannis of the world have suffered enough. || It *really* feels like you're starting from a conclusion, and trying to create evidence for it.

Firstly, why doesn't Steph Curry fit your definition? Is he too good at defense? Not ball dominant enough? How are you even defining ""offensive leader""? It's just the highest scorer?

You make caveats for Luka and Iverson and Harden, but really it feels like you're just hand waving away instances where your conclusion is wrong, or at least seriously flawed.

I do think it's an interesting topic, definitely worth discussion. Dean Oliver has written about similar concepts and I believe Cody Houdek, Scott Levine, and Evan Zucha have explored almost exactly this in their pod Sense and Scalability, calling it the ""wrong initiator"" problem. || Wow players that are great offensive players and defensive players win more than players that are limited.  This ""analysis"" ignores actual hard evidence too and instead tries to fit evidence into a hypothesis. 

I have no problem with the conclusion itself, but I mean its pretty much common sense by now. Its a piece of wisdom repeated on podcasts. ""you can't win a championship with a small guard as your best player"" Where do you think draft trends have gone in the last couple of years? || * *""...Curry doesn’t fit this profile. He is one of the rare all-time superstars who can dominate without being ball-dominant.""*
* *""As can be seen, no team with a player of the type I described has succeeded in a leading role. There are no exceptions.""*

Steph Curry is not an off-ball player—he’s not Klay Thompson. His usage rate and time of possession are comparable to LeBron’s. In 2016, Steph averaged 5.8 minutes on the ball per game, while LeBron averaged 5.3 minutes. You don’t put up 30 points and 7 assists without dominating the ball. Steph is a ball-dominant guard, short (6'4"" and under), a poor defender, and an elite scorer. He’s an exception.

* *""Kyrie is the only player from this profile to win a championship as part of a title-winning team. However, even though I list Kyrie as the PG, the true playmaker was LeBron. While Kyrie was technically the starting point guard, his role was not playmaking but scoring through individual skills in tight situations.""*

Playmaking was absolutely Kyrie's role. When LeBron sat, Kyrie took over as the primary playmaker, essentially stepping into the LeBron James role—balancing scoring and playmaking. Kyrie averaged 6 assists per game, proving he wasn’t just going 1-on-1 all the time. So this analysis is incorrect; Kyrie is an exception, much like Steph Curry. || The issue with heliocentric teams is that they have players who are that ball dominant because of lack of overall talent on the roster, and it catches up to them when they are up against better teams. Those teams losing isn’t an indictment on the playstyle, they ran into more talented teams. Teams that have more talent don’t have to rely on one guy so much. 

Ie: I am not sure the rockets play style is what caused CP3 to get hurt when they had the warriors on the ropes. || I mean yea. Players who r great at offense and defense tend to be better than players who r just great at offense. Steph curry showed that it’s possible to win w a small guard whose below avg defensively u just need to do great team building around him to make it work defensively. 

It worked with the warriors, many other teams r trying to replicate that. We’ll see if it works again. I think it will || Curry was a ball dominant guard before Kerr coached him. Mj was even more dominant before a strong coach stepped in. These incredible ball dominant players are difficult to coach bc if you just sit back, leu them be great, you still might make to conference finals or further. It takes real discipline to possibly take a step back for the overall goal. Not many franchises are smart and comfortable enough in their own skin to be firm yet not maniacal yelling to get a point across. Bc it’s not on the player to prop up lesser players, that’s the coach and organizations job || I think one of the major flaws in your reasoning is based on the sample we have available. One of the best weapons offensively-minded guards have is the three ball, which has only really become a focus of offences in roughly the past decade. So it’s hard to conclude it cannot work when, for the vast majority of the NBA’s existence, these kinds of guard have essentially been missing one of their best weapons.

Also, as a Bucks fan, your section about Dame confuses me. Whenever Giannis is on court, he’s happy to defer to him. He plays almost like a true PG then, moving the rock wherever it needs to go. He normally only takes the role of primary scorer when Giannis sits and we need a go-to offensive option. 

Holding his playoff record against him when he’s been part of some truly dreadful Blazers teams seems a bit unfair. Saying he needs to drop down to our fourth or fifth option makes absolutely no sense and, as stated, he’s already seemed to accept a pass-first role whenever Giannis is around. And him taking the lead in scoring when Giannis sits makes perfect sense. Who should we have ahead of him? Bobby? GTJ? The only reasonable answer is Middleton, who’s still returning from injury and has, for the time being, settled comfortably into a playmaking role || Love how this guy. Doesn't bring up the Detroit Piston which made it to the NBA Final 3 years in a row 88-90 won 89-90 back to back NBA Championship with Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumar, Dennis Rodman, John Salley, Rick Mahorn, Bill Lambeer and Mark Aguirre. || [removed] || [removed] || Do you mean guard or point guard?  
  
There are tons of people in this list that are ball-dominant shooting guards that won titles as the best player. Jordan, Kobe, Dwyane Wade, Curry, Magic Johnson. Yes, these weren't small players, but they all have very high usage rates, meaning they didn't necessarily bring the ball up the court, but the ball was in their hands a lot. And yes, Curry and Magic were point guards.

Also, the game has changed so that players that used to be shooting guards have been shifted to point guards to put the ball in the hands of the best play-maker more often. Jordan would 100% be a point guard in today's game as would Kobe and Wade.

Harden started as a shooting guard and guys like Cade Cunningham and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander would probably have not been point guards two decades ago. Probably Trae too.  
  
The only thing all these ""ball-dominant guards"" on your list have in common is that they didn't play with other elite superstars. The number of players that have actually led their teams to titles is very small. || >As can be seen, no team with a player of the type I described has succeeded in a leading role. There are no exceptions.

There simply hasn't been a good enough player of that type. You need absolutely transcendent offense to make up for the other shortcomings. 

Part of the story is that we haven't had all that much time with a model. Before Curry became an all-star in 2014, the conventional wisdom was that shooting too many threes wouldn't work in the playoffs. In hindsight, Steve Nash could have hit your profile, but he was curtailing his three point shooting because they didn't know any better.

>Another exception might be Iverson’s Philadelphia team, but even then, the key detail was Iverson transitioning to the shooting guard position, thereby reducing his ball dominance.

2001 Iverson led the league in usage rate. He was as ball dominant a player as they come.

>However, he “isn’t that valuable.” He hasn’t won a championship or even reached the Finals. He never will. Perhaps one day, if he takes on a fourth or fifth role (e.g., Giannis stays in Milwaukee, the Bucks magically (!) find two elite offensie players or Middleton heals, and Lillard transitions to a pass-first role, hitting open shots, and his minutes drop to around 20 per game), he might achieve this.

This doesn't make any sense. If you want a pass-first fourth option on offense, surely you want a better defender than Lillard.

Regarding Lillard's inability to make the finals, I'm less than fully confident prime Jordan takes the 2019 Blazers past the Warriors. || The discussion actually harks back on the principles of the Triangle offense, and the benefits of true team basketball.

Michael Jordan could probably be the greatest point guard of all time, and most likely win 0 championships if he was. There were stints before Phil came to coach the Bulls where Jordan was a dominant overall player, rebounding, passing, defense too. He could average as many assists and rebounds as LeBron if he wanted to. But that necessarily doesn't equate to winning basketball at the highest level, because ultimately basketball is a TEAM game and the best TEAMS win championships. Not the best players, not necessarily the most talented players, not the best ORTGs in the regular season, but the best TEAMS. 

This was what the Triangle did. It shifted the focus from making Jordan, a shooting guard, from leading the offense, from an offense where everyone is dependent on him to create everything, to an offense where people can create for themselves within the system and through their knowledge, IQ, and mastery of the flow of the Triangle. Something like the Triangle, or in other words, a self-sufficient flowing offense, gets more players involved without needing to heavily rely on a guard. And when players are more involved, they play better defense. 

A ball-dominant guard is in many ways the antithesis of team basketball. The guard who must create everything for everyone and will only pass to open players-- if you ever played with that at a basketball court you'd see how bad it really is, how less fun it is, because it's not too far off from isolation-focused basketball. Similar sentiment travels all the way up to the highest level of basketball. 

Not only that but there's and Xs and Os standpoint to it too. A ball-dominant guard operates at the top of the key. You inherently have fewer options to make a pass because there's fewer angles to work with. This is why playmaking forwards, centers, or big guards are generally more dangerous. By getting the ball to playmakers in the post, not only are they in a more deadly area to score, but they have many more angles, actions, and options to make a pass to a shooter or a cutter. They are harder to double as well because you can't hedge on some sort of PnR, you can't trap them above the three point line, and a post pass to them isn't that hard to make. This is what the Triangle, even the Spurs system, and the Warriors system depended on. They depended on Pippen to lead the Triangle, on Shaq and Gasol to playmake at their size, on Tim Duncan, on Draymond Green (who led the Warriors on assists). Big players who can playmake or pass make this system work, and they don't even need to dominate the ball. This is why Jokic, who is just as ball dominant as Luka or Harden, will come out with better success than those 2 come regular season or playoffs where his only inhibitions are actually his defense, not the function of their offense.

History over the last 30+ years has shown, big playmakers, motion offenses will result in better teams that perform at the highest level than teams led by ball-dominant players who operate at the top of the key.

LeBron James actually fits more into ball dominant guard than ball dominant forward, precisely because he prefers to operate from the top of the key as opposed to the post. It's a huge contributor to his inability to fit with a number of different types of players, which also contributes to poor Finals record despite having excellent amounts of talent for a very large majority of his career. || Sounds like a thinly failed anti Luka post when SGA has a higher usage rate. Where’s SGA playoff success if his style is so much better? || I don't know about ball dominance itself but short guards rarely win championships as the leading scorer.

People here might get upset and try to divert the conversation into something else (see: the top comment) but it's logical that the shorter players are going to struggle more against playoff caliber defenses.  The NBA is heavily predicated on height and athleticism.

Additionally, the small guards who are talented tend to be strong scorers and facilitators in the regular season that they they produce wins and make it difficult for the front office to acquire extra help via the draft.

So, between an All-Star PG type vs. an All-Star SF type, I think the latter is easier to build a contender with.  Otherwise, a championship squad is predicated on one MVP contender surrounded by three 17+ppg players (preferably, another All-Star among them....and you can substitute one dominant specialist like Ben Wallace/Draymond Green/Dennis Rodman here).....with 3/5 of the starters playing defense and a solid bench backing them up.  Great majority of championships squads throughout history have featured this.

Not rocket science here.  4/5 offensive outlets (including an MVP tier talent) and 3/5 defensive chokepoints means you bring what needs to be brought to a basketball team. || As constructed, Trae has a better shot of winning a title on the Hawks than on the Spurs. That's a fact. Vassell ain't winning no title as an ""elite scorer"" lol || I wouldn't say the archetype of player you're describing (that in my small NBA group chat are known as ""The Clarksons"") is being *overvalued*, I think scoring \~20 points regularly is still no small task, that's why teams keep paying players that can do that.

The alternative is moneyballing those 20ppg and that means getting a team together that fits perfectly within this strategy, and in basketball is way harder than baseball because you have less players.

So to me, the problem is just that they are not using these players in an effective way. For example, when you said:

>Russell Westbrook (although his prime is behind him, he was one of the best candidates for this profile at the time), Lillard, Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, James Harden, Cunningham, Bradley Beal, and the like. There are also lower-tier versions, such as Jalen Green, Collin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Malik Monk, D’angelo Russell, etc.

the ""lower-tier versions"" are actually the players that are being used correctly. You're not building your team or starting unit around Clarkson, Sexton, Monk, DLo. You're not asking them to guard the 2nd or 3rd best player on the opposing team, you're not asking them to lead. Those are specialists, you need them to score points and go back to sleep. Again, no small feat, and that's why they are employed.

The players that are in your first tier, didn't really have the right team around them. And It's not that the team was spending so much money on them, because they overvalued them and didn't have cap space left to surround them better, the problem to me still is that they are put into roles they don't fit, and because of that any analysis that the team makes to complete the rest of the team is fundamentally flawed. Like, let's go to a couple of examples from your list

Russ: The problem with Russ is that either he's uncoachable, or that he's just not smart, or that he gets easily carried away. I can talk about how he was surrounded, but the difference between him and the rest is that there's  a flaw in his character. The best way to use Russ at times, was to have him take a back seat and just move the ball around, but he'd just pull up, and that killed so many games for all teams he's been on.

Lillard: This is the best example of what I'm trying to explain. Lillard is a god tier scorer, but he's small, he can't AND won't try to defend, and he's not a real floor general. What does Portland do in this situation? For some reason, complete their backcourt with another identical player, but worse in every way, and keep it that way for years. He needed a backcourt partner and a wing that could defend at a high level, and overall players that would be comfortable moving the ball around. Like, ""Dame, you score we do the rest"". You mentioned Iverson moving to the SG spot being the key to that team's success, I disagree, the position is meaningless, the key is surrounding him with talent that fits. The team let him shoot a gazillion times, used a center that could score easy baskets and clean up around the rim, and had a 6th man who could step up and score when he sat down.

Trae: The only time the Hakws had a successful post season, It was a fluke. They haven't surrounded Trae with the type of player he would thrive on. He can lead the offense so he doesn't need another guy that can set the table for him, he does need (like any other player that can pass at a high, high level like him), shooters around him, and defenders so he can hide on D. The only thing the Hawks gave him was Dejounte who fell off a cliff defensively, and now Dyson Daniels who seems to be good for the role. He still needs a bunch of shooters, and a good big to run PnRs and at the moment, their big rotation is chaothic, nobody knows which center is the best, and both are sub-par centers overall.

To wrap it up because this is already too long, you're mentioning some examples of similar players that are good because they thrive off ball. I think this is more of a consequence than a cause. Kyrie, Jamal, Steph, they all have forwards or centers running the point. That's was I was mentioning above, they can't be ball dominant if someone else is setting the table, they have the freedom of movement they need, and if you have the scoring and assisting locked up, you can use the SG spot to get a plus defender.

You can win with any type of player if it's good enough, you just need to build a good team around him. || I definitely subscribe to this theory. There's a compelling mechanistic explanation. Deep in the playoffs, against other elite teams, most of the key differences cut against the player prototype you describe:

Increased physicality makes it harder for smaller, weaker plays to play long minutes. Increased defensive intensity and skill make it harder to maintain your offensive efficiency unless you have the physical size / strength advantage. Defenses scheme to disrupt your flow, particularly sending help, which is a lot easier for taller players (that can easily pass out of a double team / blitz) to deal with, even if you are an elite playmaker.

For players who are weaker defensively, offenses will hunt out mismatches, which also affects your ability to play long, effective minutes game after game.

The best devil's advocate argument I've seen is Steph Curry. Removing him, a lot of the players / teams that have fallen short have really been on the bad side of coin flips. Nash's Suns could have easily done it. Chris Paul & James Harden had some bad luck late in the playoffs. Devin Booker's Suns almost won a finals. || Learned this when the Celtics had IT, Kyrie and then Kemba. It doesn’t work in the playoffs unless you have an anomaly like Steph who is one of the greatest ever. || I actually really enjoy this take. It’s kind of common sense, but at least in the last decade, teams were really trying so hard to find their ball-dominant offensive guard.

I also believe there’s kind of a back-and-forth evolution causing the change. First, guards are encouraged to take 100% of offensive loads after 3-ball and PnR techniques matured. Then, teams countered by drafting mobile wings/ centers, as well as developing advanced defensive schemes. So now the remaining positions and teams have stepped up to the small ball game, and the ball-dominant guard offense became less effective. || Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Steph Curry are all ball dominant guards in their own way.  The players you're citing just aren't nearly as good as they are.  I think ""poor defender"" is doing a lot of work here.

If the best player on your team is Bradley Beal or LaMelo Ball, your team isn't very good.  That's not their fault, that's just poor roster construction.  That doesn't mean they can't be valuable contributors to a championship team. || i think everybody already knew about this. since ball dominant guards are basically the engine of the team and come playoffs everyone would just put a pressure on the engine and everything would fall apart.

what unrealistic for this is for a gm to convince a ball dominant guard to play with a restricted role. first off the salary just wont match unless you are a big market team that could just go over luxury, getting a superstar big/wing is harder when you have a superstar ball dominant guard since your team is guaranteed to not be shit (at least making the playoffs) so you wont get assets for trade and the only way a to get them is through free agency. convincing the guard to get lower salaries is just more unrealistic.

and damn do people really still think westbrook is a poor defender? hes nowhere near all defensive level, but just because of old age and one season of ballwatching defense (where he transitioned from playing with one of the best superstar in the league at the time to being fatigued all game while having to carry a whole team with no offensive weapon to playoffs) people really think hes a career shit defender. hes a decent on ball defender who gambles in passing lane a lot. you cant group him with the others. his case is definitely about shooting not defense, probably one of the most niche cases in nba history : losing his jumpshot overtime || It’s because they’re too small. Look at the history of Finals MVPs. How many point guards do you see on that list? Magic doesn’t count, he’s 6’9. You have IT, Chauncey, and Steph. 
3 guards who had the PERFECT team built for them. 3 outliers out of 80+ years of NBA basketball. 

When it’s the postseason, and the game slows down, there comes times where you NEED your star to get you a bucket. Ask yourselves, what is an easier shot: a 6’7+ guy attacking the rim for a layup, or a 6’1 guard trying to create an off balance jumper from the perimeter? Who in this situation will have an easier time getting themselves a good shot? There’s your answer to this question. || The highest success of this player is Allen iverson making it to the finals. But there is still no valid proof of success with these players. I often say they’re just putting up points. Not winning not necessarily competing but just dribbling and shooting and it goes in. || Ball dominance is good actually.

Most valuable offensive players (by actual data, not made up formulas), best offenses (especially in the playoffs) all skew towards ball-dominant players.

Being messi >>> being cr7

Ben Taylor theories don't actually matter it turns out u/[cihan2t](https://www.reddit.com/user/cihan2t/) || > A guard, ball-dominant, usually short (6'4"" and under), a poor defender, and a good scorer .. no team in the modern era (and this also applies to earlier eras) has won a championship with this type of player as their number-one option.

It's funny because this myth used to just be about small point guards but now we've weaseled in ""ball dominance"" and ""poor defense"". The former allows you to exclude Steph Curry's 4 rings.  The latter I guess lets you exclude a few others including Tony Parker (#1 option for a lot of Spurs teams) as well as a few others, notably some teams that lost the finals.  It's also worth mentioning that ""small"" was also a weasel word added to let the original criteria ignore Magic's 5 rings.  

All of these qualifiers also make the claims less surprising. There's 5 positions on the basketball court, you're taking a fraction of one of them and a tiny fraction of a second one.  Even if success has nothing to do with lead player archtype you're talking about a fairly small percentage of teams and so even over decades you're only going to expect a handful teams to be led by a guy with all these criteria.  

>  the modern era .. 1991 

1991 isn't the start of ""the modern era"" which is generally dated to post-Merger and/or the 3-point line and/or Bird/Magic era when the money took off.  1980 is a typical cutoff. Let's just be honest, **1991 is you cherry picking the endpoint to avoid the Bad Boys Pistons** full stop. There's also no reason to think that the 3 point era or merger made life harder for small ball dominant guards so let's evaluate this claim honestly and go back further: 

Russell's Celts were often led by small guards initially Cousy and Sharman/Ramsey, later KC and Sam Jones. Most were solid/good defenders *for their position*. 

Jojo White (6'3"") was arguably the #1 option for the '76 Celtics, decent defender.

Gus Williams was the #1 option for Seattle '78 and wasn't a good defender.  

Isiah Thomas was the #1 option for the Bad Boys Pistons and wasn't a good defender.

Tony Parker (6'2"") was the #1 options for the '14 Spurs and arguable in '07. He was for sure on the '13 team that was a second away. Overrated defense. 

Steph Curry's defense improved but looks better on paper due to second order offensive effects.  And while he is renowned for off-ball play he has the ball in his hands a lot more than people think. In 2016 he had higher Usage than James Harden. In 2021 he was higher than Trae Young or Dame (who he's right next to for career). || You lost me at Milwaukee trading Holiday to Boston for Lillard... that's not what happened lol. I don't get why people claim Milwaukee GAVE Holiday to Boston || I still support the conclusion of needing a “top X player”

2004 being an exception doesn’t erase the general rule. Look at the best player on title teams over the last 40 years at least, it’s a pretty damn elite group. The 04 Pistons are a wild exception, but an exception nonetheless


Nothing is full proof, but it’s hard to imagine a team having a real chance at the title without that. I agree about hardline rules in most of these cases, but a lot of these were about shifting trends in talent and playstyle in the league.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.107,0.76,0.133,0.9967,0.084,0.752,0.164,0.9999
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"""Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""Shai"" OR ""Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""The Shai""",2024-12-14,nbadiscussion,1hetyi2,"Cade Cunningham is a star. To become a superstar, he has to fix two problems","Cade Cunningham is having a moment. But how high can he soar with two distinct weights dragging him back down to Earth?

In his fourth season (and first with a dedicated, competent NBA coach in JB Bickerstaff), the 6’6” point guard is putting up All-Star numbers: 23.6 points, 9.3 assists (third in the NBA!), and 7.3 rebounds per game on 45% shooting from the field. He’s also canning 38% of his 6.3 three-balls per game.

Cunningham’s most notable improvement is in his shot. The three-pointer was a major question mark for Cade coming into the year, but he’s shooting a career-high on both accuracy and volume, and it’s become a legitimate weapon. Importantly, the improvement has come across the board and supported a shift in how the shots are generated.

He's improved his catch-and-shoot accuracy from 37.1% last year to 42.0% this year and his pull-up three-pointer from 32.5% to 36.0%. However, his volume of catch-and-shoots has decreased from 3.4 to 2.3 per game, and his volume of pull-ups has doubled from 2.0 to 4.0

This is unusual! We often hear that coaches want star guards to take more catch-and-shoots because, for most players (including Cunningham), that’s the more efficient shot. The gravity of a team’s biggest star moving off-ball can free things up for lesser heavenly bodies, too. But Cunningham is doing far more self-made magic off the dribble than before and converting it at a very respectable rate.

In fact, that’s an overall trend in Motown: the Pistons are quickly resembling the kind of heliocentric offenses that have started to fall out of favor.

Everything flows through Cunningham. He is fourth in the league with[ 94.0 touches per gam](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/touches?dir=D&sort=TOUCHES)e, more than LaMelo Ball, Giannis Antetokounmpo, or Luka Doncic. He’s [sixth in passes per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing?dir=D&sort=PASSES_MADE), and his [34.9% usage rate](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4864#tab-offensive_overview) is fifth behind only Ball, Giannis, Ja Morant, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.

Despite the gaudy assist totals, I’m not sure Cunningham’s passing has improved so much as the team’s offensive personnel has (it must be nice to play with some veterans like Malik Beasley who are capable of making the occasional shot, although the team’s shooting is still lackluster overall). Dishing remains Cunningham’s best attribute. He has especially nice vision finding alleys for oops: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Cunningham is attacking the boards with a renewed vigor this season (personal aside: I love rebounding guards), and his defensive effort has dramatically improved from last season’s career-worst level. Coach Bickerstaff has always gotten the best from his players on that end, and Cunningham is no exception. He’s had some loud blocks, both of the chase-down variety and as the low-man help defender. This one on Antetokounmpo (followed by a sexy long-range bounce pass) deserved a comic-book-style “POW!”: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Bickerstaff hasn’t shied away from siccing Cunningham on talented ballhandlers, either. He’s been the primary defender on Jaylen Brown and Jalen Brunson, for two notable examples. While defensive tracking data is suspect at best, opponents have shot [4.2% worse than expected](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*cun) with Cunningham as the nearest defender (in the same neighborhood as Dillon Brooks, Draymond Green, and Evan Mobley, although I’m certainly not suggesting he’s on their level as a defender).

At this point, Cunningham is a bit too slow and inconsistent to be more than an average defender, but average is fine! He’s rarely the weak point offenses will attack — [teams have only targeted him 13 times in isolation](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/players/615e4bcfe771e94fc0e9eab4/playtypes?seasonId=66ec94cbd172189f95bf08b2&competitionId=non-exhibition-54457dce300969b132fcfb34&compsCategory=1&offense=false), far less on a per-game basis than last year. They prefer to go after juicier targets like Tim Hardaway Jr. or Tobias Harris (although Harris, in particular, has held up well in those situations). It is worth noting that Bickerstaff’s players have historically shown steady defensive growth across multiple seasons. Cunningham’s size and intelligence mean he could end up being a plus on that end.

Add it all up, and he’s carrying a two-ton made-in-Detroit SUV on his shoulders. It’s a heavy load for a fourth-year player, particularly one still with fewer than two full seasons of games under his belt. To Cunningham’s immense credit, he’s grown with his burden. His advanced metrics are at career-best levels, including an [EPM ](https://dunksandthrees.com/player/1630595)just outside the top decile of the league. [Andy Bailey’s Huge Nerd Index](https://x.com/AndrewDBailey/status/1866908831525290265), which averages seven prominent catch-all metrics, rates him as the 30th-best player in the league. Having turned 23 the day before Halloween, Cunningham is younger than every single player above him except two (albeit by a few weeks in some cases).

This is all fantastic news for the Detroit Pistons. They have a young, growing star on their hands. But to become a *superduperstar*, Cunningham has two last warts to freeze off. Both require a little context.

Everyone’s heard about Cunningham’s turnover problems at this point. He leads the league with 4.6 per game, a smidge higher than Young or Ball. Part of that is due to the sheer amount of playmaking that falls on the youngster. His actual [turnover rate of 15.6% ](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4864#tab-offensive_overview)is only 33rd percentile for point guards; in other words, below-average but far from league-worst.

My eyeballs see two major causes. First, he has to tighten up his handle. Cunningham’s ballhandling skill is high, but he can get careless with the rock. A low point was a recent game against the Pacers (an easy Detroit win, to be fair), when Jarace Walker snatched Cade’s cookies four separate times. He starts his crossover high and pushes through it slowly, giving good defenders time to jam him up: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Cunningham also routinely makes passes my toddler would call “silly” (and I’d call something else). At times, he predetermines his reads and can’t or won’t audible. His [8.3% turnover rate on drives](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives?CF=GP*GE*10&dir=D&sort=DRIVES) is the highest of anyone in the top 20 for drives per game (min. 10 games played), and inexplicable passes like this are part of the reason why: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Other times, he gets caught indecisively in the air, lofting balloons for opponents to snag by the string and merrily sprint away with: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Cunningham should outgrow some of these mistakes, but like any high-usage ballhandler, some will always remain. Turnovers, in and of themselves, aren’t always a bad thing, but I’d like to see more turnovers of aggression rather than meekness. He needs to excise the worst offenses to maximize his playmaking abilities. I am optimistic he will do so, particularly as the Pistons’ surrounding cast improves.

Cade’s second flaw is a little more nuanced. He’s struggled to finish at the hoop his entire career, and it hasn’t improved much over time. A third of his shots have come at the rack this season, a substantial number, but Cunningham [has never finished a season above 58% at the rim](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4864#tab-shooting_accuracy), an atrocious rate for a player his size.

A deeper statistical analysis reveals something interesting. Bball-Index’s proprietary formulas say Cunningham has elite finishing talent but is taking some of the hardest shots in the league when considering shot location and defensive presence (he is in the first percentile for “Rim Shot Quality”).

That’s a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it means Cade can generate and finish the difficult shots that all offenses require to a degree; on the other, it means he pretty much *only* takes difficult shots. Cade is a below-average athlete for someone who drives as much as he does, relying on craft and guile to worm into the paint. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen Cunningham redline his engine. The ability to play at his own pace is a skill, but he also never gets the blow-by layups that quicker counterparts can feast on.

He doesn’t have enough first-step quickness to explode past guys or vertical pop to elevate in traffic for big finishes (Cunningham has tallied just four dunks in 22 games this season). He is at his best when he remembers to use his size to bump a defender off their lane and extend over them for a layup. He loves to use a spin (full or half) to get a moment’s separation: [\[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Taller, slower point guards rarely excel in the paint; LaMelo and Lonzo Ball have famously struggled with the same issue. Cunningham isn’t likely to turn into the Roadrunner anytime soon, but there are ways for him to improve.

Can he get even stronger and bully smaller defenders? Cade doesn’t have a bulldog frame, but there is potential for him to fill out more. Can his three-point accuracy improve to the point that defenders have to stick tighter to him, allowing him to create bigger advantages with hesitations and shot fakes? Can he develop Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s airtight shake-and-bake handle? He’s been on-ball more than ever this year, but is there some latent cutting and off-ball savvy in his game? Cunningham’s also still working on his off-hand; he’s become *far* better driving left, but there’s still room for improvement.

A related note: finding a way to draw more free throws would help Cunningham’s efficiency immensely. Some fans believe he gets a bad whistle, but the truth is that he hasn’t been able to create off-the-dribble advantages that lead to compromised defenders. They have no reason to foul when they can bother the shot with a good contest.

Taking a step back, the fact that Cunningham can get to the rim as much as he does is promising; adding just a little more efficiency here would do wonders for his overall game. He’ll have to hit on at least one of the ideas above to do so.

The difference between stars and superstars is their ability to create high-level, efficient offense for themselves and their teammates. Cunningham has continually progressed in this area, and lineups with the point guard [have scored at league-median rates](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4864/lineups#tab-four_factors) despite below-average surrounding talent. But there isn’t a superstar in the league with as poor finishing numbers as Cunningham (at least, who doesn’t also draw free throws), and he simply must find a way to improve his rim scoring to reach his potential.

Cunningham has developed (and brought Detroit along with him) despite one of the worst basketball ecosystems in the league. For the first time since Cunningham was still in high school, the Pistons are respectably bad instead of a laughingstock (their *best* record in the last five years was 23-59; they’re on pace for 32 this season). Questions about Cunningham’s ceiling on a contender are beside the point; Cunningham is far from a finished product, and the Pistons have a lot of talent acquisition to go before they can start worrying about competing for home-court advantage in the playoffs. Cunningham has time and a clear roadmap for improvement. There are multiple routes he can travel to get to his destination, although he’s far from certain to get there. I’m excited to see which direction he takes.",304,48,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hetyi2/cade_cunningham_is_a_star_to_become_a_superstar/,2024-12-15 09:43:39," I want the kid to succeed. Detroit has been no-man’s land for almost twenty years in the NBA. Hope he can continue to get better. His scoring needs to improve overall if he’s going to make it to elite levels. At that level of usage he needs to be scoring more. Some talent around him would help that but he’s just not that dynamic of a scorer compared to other elite guards.

East:

G: **Jalen Brunson** - Bonafide superstar after last year with the New York market to back him up.

G: **Donovan Mitchell**- Best offensive player/most marketable player on a team on pace for 70+ wins.

F: **Jayson Tatum** - Known commodity having an excellent season

F: **Giannis Antetokounmpo** - Superstar arguably having his best individual season, likely best player in the east, leads the league in scoring and Bucks are hot.

C: **Karl Anthony-Towns** - With Embiid being in and out of the lineup KAT is likely the best center in the east, and he's been playing amazing as he meshes into new surroundings. Also has the New York Market.

B1: **Damian Lillard** - Popular vet having a great season.

B2: **Jaylen Brown** - Last year's Finals MVP who will lose his shit if he gets snubbed again after the Olympics.

B3: **Trae Young** - Trae is back to proper All-Star form after a few down years missing the weekend.

B4: **Evan Mobley** - Young big who has made the leap into a versatile legit weapon on both ends.

B5: **LaMelo Ball** - Honestly I'm not too sure about this one, he's averaging thirty but he is typically made out of glass so I think it will depend on how many games he plays in the coming weeks.

B6: **Cade Cunningham** - Young budding star with great counting stats and who's impressive maturity has helped turn Detroit around immensely.

B7: **Darius Garland** Great player on a team that I think deserves to get three guys into the game.

I'd probably put Tyrese Maxey, Derrick White, RJ Barrett, Jarrett Allen, Jalen Johnson and Tyler Herro first up for injury reserves.

**WEST:**

G: **Shai-Gilgeous Alexander** - On here for obvious reasons

G: **Luka Doncic** - See above

F: **LeBron James** - Ah, this is a tricky one. Obviously fucking LeBron James will be an all-star game starter. And is he an all-star caliber player? Yes. Does every all-star caliber player get to be in the all-star game in the year 2024? No. Does LeBron objectively deserve to be an all-star starter this year? Probably not.

F: **Victor Wembanyama** - Everyone knew it was only a matter of time before this guy was at the very top of the league in terms of production, and here we are.

F: **Nikola Jokic** - An absurd basketball player

B1: **Anthony Davis** - The Lakers have a lot of problems, and Anthony Davis is only one of them sometimes. One of the biggest names in the league, he will be in the All-Star game.

B2: **Anthony Edwards** - Edwards has had a... weird season thus far. He has all but abandoned his athletic interior game to chick up threes on ridiculous efficiency. But is that what the Wolves need from him? Probably not. He will also be in the All-Star game.

B3: **Jaren Jackson Jr** - The Memphis Grizzlies are second in the West, so naturally I hear nothing about them ever. I was surprised to see that Jackson Jr. is their leading scorer. Maybe a Memphis fan can explain their success despite Ja and Bane having down years statistically. (Especially Bane, wtf is happening there?)

B4: **Kevin Durant** - Kevin Durant will be in the NBA All-Star game

B5: **Stephen Curry** - I honestly don't believe Curry deserves a spot this year, but see my entries for KD and Bron for an explanation.

B6: **Alperen Sengun** - Sengun is probably having a worse individual year than last year when at time she was heralded as the second coming of Jokic, but the Rockets have shot right to the top of the West this year and need a guy in the big game. I figure it should be Sengun, but again I literally never hear anything about the Rockets outside of Reddit and am not totally sure who their main guy is considering it seems that they have pretty consistent production across the roster and their top scorer Jalen Green is still the proto-type of AAU ball.

B7: **Kyrie Irving** - The last spot in the West was a tough decision. I gave it to Kyrie because he is having a great year, the Mavs are near the top of the West, he's coming off of a high publicity playoff run, and he is a known commodity in the league.

I'd probably put Jalen Williams, James Harden, Devin Booker, Ja Morant and De'Aaron Fox up first for injury reserves. Frankly I would put any of these guys in over Curry but I know that's not going to happen.

If you read this far congratulations. This has been a nice way to spend an hour. Let me know what your thoughts are.",97,60,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hogf1q/mock_early_allstar_rosters/,2024-12-28 16:57:33,"I'm really nibbling at the edges here, but snubs implies that they're having a great season and maybe only barely miss out on a spot. It doesn't mean a known good player who's scoring 20 a game or some prior All-Star. Maybe they're honorable mentions or sub All-Stars (a concept from Thinking Basketball), but they're not snubs.


For instance, I find it difficult to believe that the Pelicans get 4 players in the snub category with the worst record in the West. Green, Randle, and Gobert (as much as I liked his contributions with us) are not snubs either. 


Similar for the East. || Anthony Edwards is shooting 3s this season because the starting line up has Gobert, McDaniels, and Randle who all do not give him spacing to play an interior game. || I really agree with these. It's hard to get new blood in the game with all the legacy/ large market picks but that's just part of it for now. 

As a Grizzlies fan, Bane had an oblique injury early in the season and he just now seems to be shaking the rust off. Combine that with playing fewer minutes by design with a deep bench and his numbers are down. I'm not concerned. || I can explain the Memphis situation. JJJ massively improved when he was the only one healthy last season playing with literal G league players as his starting teammates. Ja keeps getting hurt every three games so he has missed a lot and is trying to focus on assisting more. Bane got an injury early season and is just now getting back to form. He was pretty bad for a while though. The Grizzlies are doing so well because during the offseason they fired almost all of the assistant coaches and brought in a ton of new ones. The new offense is all about sharing the ball and playing with the fastest pace in the NBA. Most games even the starters play under 30min because the philosophy is to always have fresh guys in the game. So far the Grizzlies have the best bench in the league and that’s why they keep winning even though Ja and Bane haven’t been at their best. Also drafting two rookies who are top 5 helps. Oh yeah and GG and Vince still haven’t even played yet. (Vince played two games but I’m not counting that.) || If you think Curry doesn’t deserve an Allstar nod this year, I will agree on that. But Allstar game is in San Francisco, his home turf. Plus, he is like top 2 in terms of popularity so I think he will still be an Allstar even though he is regressing. || Jalen Williams has to be in there, OKC are miles ahead in the West and deserve at least 2 All-Stars (and if Chet wasn't injured you could even make a case for 3 All-stars) || I think your East is probably close to what it will be (some of it is easy to predict – the East starters are already pretty much locked up). However, I think it will Herro instead of LaMelo. Coaches reward winning with the reserves. Heat are sixth right now, Hornets thirteenth. Heat will have someone. Bam is having a down year and there’s no way coaches reward Jimmy for whatever is going on with him. And Herro has been great. He’s having a crazy efficient year and has been good enough to deserve it. || I think your east lineup is great. I think Herro might sneak in, but that’s it. 

In the west, I think Harden should be an absolute lock, but because of politics he might miss it. He’s better than Sengun and Kai. Imo Sabonis, Fox, and maybe Book and JDub have also been better than those two. || Harden deserves it. I don’t think Dallas should have 2 all stars. Luka might miss it depending on the severity of his injury. 

As for the East, I don’t think Cleveland will get 3 all stars. I think Hali or Maxey gets in instead of Garland. || Sengun inclusion by a non biased Rockets fan is great to see. His game isn’t as flashy because of the Udokas system, but he’s way more effective overall which has contributed to team success. || Nice breakdown…pretty darn accurate…definitely hope Melo plays the rest of the games till ASG…he’s a joy to watch, makes me chuckle how much fun he’s having 🕊 || Agree with all except for Kyrie, I think JDub and Harden deserve it more than he does rn given that the league normally awards the top teams two all stars like last year with KAT and Ant and that a surprising team like the Clips would normally have an all star especially one thats a house hold name. 

Though I do not hate the selection and understand your reasoning for that || Focused mostly on your East lineup as I’m a Sixers homer. 

Lamelo entertaining AF and has played 22 games, def would keep him in.

I take the all star as popularity / the current season. So don’t care that Brown was finals MVP or would be upset, he’s on outside of the fence for me 

Josh hart as a snub what? 

I’d get Maxey in the mix - otherwise generally like the work (once again, am homer) || LaMelo is not an All-Star!! His team is 7-24. This is the Bradley Beal 2020 situation. 30 PPG on a bottom feeder on bad efficiency is not All-Star worthy. Also noteworthy that Beal shot 45% from the field and LaMelo is shooting 42%. Empty stats. || I agree on all of the above. My heart tells me that Lebron and Durant should be swapped, but I know that is unlikely.

Doesn't mean I won't keep voting for Tyrese and Pascal but after the start we had... Siakam has an argument but it is unlikely. || I will be shocked if Sengun makes the all-star game

He should behind Jalen Williams, Harden, Fox definitely and then probably behind Nooker, Morant and Powell || I would take Trae over Brunson for the first five this year. He is doing great as a playmaker with that young players around him. || Definite agree on curry arguably not deserving it, might put KD over Vic in the starters just due to fan vote and bc he’s still been very good this year || [removed] || [removed] || I’m glad you asked caused I dropped a video 2 weeks ago, a few minor tweaks 

https://youtu.be/MyZcJWoxE_k || Nice list, what shocked me the most is that Jaren Jackson is the leading scorer not Ja Morant! || He won't make it because of the injury, but Cam Thomas at least deserves a mention. || Its pretty crazy how many people don’t realize all star reserves aren’t selected by fan vote || yeah i definitely was rough around the edges with the snubs. forgot to mention i had a low bar for that. to be fair i literally added those three guys right before i posted lol just as an add-on || i will also say that despite narratives and team success, check out randle's shooting splits when you get the chance. his scoring his slightly down but it's not like he some bum already. || Him “chucking up” threes is literally what the wolves need from him lol || What was wrong with the Grizzlies assistant coaches? || Spot on, but I think a lot of Ja's games missed to injury are precautionary this year. || that is what is frustrating about legacy guys eating up spots. you can assume every year that injury will call for replacements. also swap him and kyrie and you get no argument from me.",0.483,0.517,0.0,-0.4215,0.064,0.836,0.1,0.9911,0.095,0.708,0.197,0.9995
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"""Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""Shai"" OR ""Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""The Shai""",2025-01-29,nbadiscussion,1icwt52,Is Tyler Herro playing like an All-Star this year?,"So, the ""hot"" stretch that Tyler Herro had wasn't just a hot stretch. He not only continued to play at a high level, he also has looked better since the season started & with the All-Star reserves coming out tomorrow, I thought it'd be fun to go through his case for it & see where other fanbases also stand here(I'm a Heat fan).

Right now, he's averaging 25/5/6 per 75 possessions on 58% eFG & 62% TS. The only players that matched are Shai, Giannis, Jokic & Curry.

Starting with the impact metrics(EPM by Dunks and Threes; LEBRON by BBall-Index; DPM by Darko; eRAPTOR by Neil Paine), he ranks:  
\- 18th in expected O-EPM with +3.5  
\- 9th in actual O-EPM with +4.2  
\- 17th in O-LEBRON with +2.5  
\- 35th in O-DPM with +2.0  
\- 18th in O-eRAPTOR with +3.5

He ticks off the having good production, elite efficiency(especially given the volume, responsibility, role AND team context), and he also has the advanced metrics in his favour, too.

By all but 1 metric, he's ranked in the top 20 on offense.

Also, do note that I'm focusing on the offensive side. Defensive metrics haven't liked him at all this year(for some, it's the worst in his career). But that matters less to me for things like the All-Star game. This isn't about who's better or who would you rather have on a contending team, where more factors come into play.

What simply matters is what is the job/role for that player in their context & how well are they doing it. What does the team need from that said player & has that player done what they needed them to do?

For Herro, it's an easy yes & he's done it extremely well

He's been their engine offensively. You can see in the tracking/usage stats where he ranks on the team. He's been tasked with a lot of responsibility, both as on/off ball scorer, ball handler, passer & help with spacing/shooting. The offense also revolves around his skillset.

Here's a [link to his tracking & usage stats](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-60ewy0xz2yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1807%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De84c5022f0335573f1aeb2c24a8ab3f18a57a0e9) per BBall-Index compared to everyone on the Heat. Leads the team in touches per 75, ball dominance, offensive involvement rate, on-ball action are, true usage, and scoring possessions per 75. 

Even when looking at just the playtypes(PNR/ISO/Post ups/Handoffs), he ranks first by a good margin:

\- Herro: 10.4  
\- Butler: 6.2  
\- Rozier: 5.1  
\- Bam: 4.9

Herro has been doing it all for the Heat. That's a lot of offense going through him & actions directly involving him to score and yet, he's still putting up highly efficient numbers across the board.

The Heat's offensive rating with him on is 115.5 but take him off & it drops to 107.8 - that's the difference between 10th & 29th. Even in this stretch where the Heat's offense had significantly dropped for the year, he still drags it. In 2025, it's 114.1 with vs 106.8 without.

We also seen his production without Butler. In 20 games without Butler, Herro averages 25pts per 75 poss on 57% eFG & 61% TS with 28% usage. His stats & efficiency don't differ. & those points have been needed a lot. When games are in the mud(they have been a lot lately), you'll take any scoring you can get.

Per Cleaning the Glass, the offense is in the 71st percentile with him on and his on/off is in the 96th(!) percentile. Clear impact on the offensive end.

That's third box ticked for me.

Moving onto the ""eye test""(how he does it) and basketball.

Starting off with his shooting. That has been the biggest difference & it comes down to a change in shot diet & upping the 3pt rate. He's an *elite* shooter. He's 12th in 3pt attempts per 100 at 13.5 & shoots 40.5%. Out of 59 qualifying players with 10 3s, he's 13th in %.

Per BBall-Index shooting metrics, he ranks:

\- 7th in 3pt shooting talent  
\- 7th in 3pt pull up talent  
\- 9th in C&S 3pt talent  
\- 1st in deep 3pt talent

\- 2nd in 3pt shot making  
\- 6th in 3pt pull up shot making  
\- 5th in C&S 3pt shot making  
\- 1st in deep 3pt shot making

It's this change in his shot diet for more 3s that got him the 10th highest TS% increase over a single season since 2014, amongst on-ball guards. This year, it was the second highest behind Garland.

He went from a 45.3% 3pt rate to 55.0%. A 10% increase leaning on a skill that he's been *elite* at for the last few years.

He's the only player to rank top 10 in both 3pt pull up & C&S 3pt talent. Deadly on or off ball. There are also only 8 players to rank top 25 in 3pt shot making, pull up shot making & C&S shot making.

& it's that ability to do so in various ways. He can simply be a spot up shooter, helping with the spacing & making him a dangerous off-ball player. He shoots 48% on wide open 3s + 44% on corners. You CAN'T leave him open. His spacing & gravity helps & makes life easier.

[Here's a link to his C&S 3pt & off-ball video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580807857070146)

That off-ball ability & gravity also turns into this. There are multiple instances where he makes the defense panic if comes off a screen or even looks like he's about to go for a 3pt. That's the level of a shooter that he is. This helps with any off-ball movement run for him

[Here's a link to his gravity video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580809929089386)

But it's the handoff + off the dribble where the scoring has taken a jump - he does take 10 PNRs + handoffs combined. Being able to create space for 3s off dribble or off handoffs adds unpredictability. It makes defense have to over play him & he can still get a 3 off in other ways.

[Here's a link to his off dribble 3s video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580812005204320)

That's why his efficiency looks like this. Per BBall-index, his stable PPP:

\- 1.12 points on handoffs  
\- 1.18 on spot ups  
\- 1.24 in transition  
\- 1.10 on off ball screen  
\- 0.94 in PNR

Only 6 other players score at least 1.0 PPP in the first four & 0.9 in the PNR - Dame/Shai/Haliburton/Powell/Pritchard/Edwards

What this all led to is an improvement inside & everywhere else(including his passing). 1st, he took away his inefficient mid-ranges. He's now also shooting 63% within 4ft & 54% within 4-14ft. Out of 64 players with at least 20 2pt per 100, he's 13th in %

The biggest difference is the driving ability & creating off dribble. There's a DRASTIC difference in how aggressive he looks + how he embraced going through contact. There have also been more counters + better moves to shift & get open then burst to the rim.

That's why there's now a more willingness to attack & get to the rim. His rim rate is at 17%(2nd highest in career) - a big improvement from 11% & 13% the last 2 years. Combine that with the shooting, this has been as best of a 3 level scoring season he's ever had

[Here's a link to his drives video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884583295725216122)

What's also been better is the passing & playmaking. That has taken a significant step from last year & has been as big of a difference maker in his impact as everything stated above. This was another major flaw/weakness & it simply isn't like that anymore

Some stats per BBall-Index amongst 93 on-ball players:

\- 23rd in playmaking talent

\- 24th in passing creation quality

\- 21st in box creation

\- 16th in P&R creation rate

There's been a clear increase in volume + responsibility as a passer & that was a needed thing to learn how to balance that with the scoring.

And when you compare him to himself, that's also where you see the drastic improvement. [Here's a link to his tracking passing stats over the last three years](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-ns8j3sx15yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D735%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De2e6168f4471a0a51d010be42925096be56ea87d)!

[Here's a link to his passing off drives & PNR video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884587337503383633)

This is where you see the improved decision making. He's been reading the defense a lot better. And with him being a more willing driver + more aggressive, these windows open up a lot more.

This also has led to him being way more blitzed and the results were better than expected.

[Here's a link to 6 min of him getting blitzed video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884587341236339164)

Finally, let's also touch on the competition. His comp for the 2 backup guards: Cade/Dame/Garland/Ball/Trae/Haliburton/LaVine

[Here are the metrics for all of them.](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-a53owp3n5yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D812%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D65d771e844f1b86ec3d1264f56ab51ca6c8f07e2)

Herro ranks: 5th, tied 4th, 6th, tied 4th, tied 6th, 5th, and 5th

I'd take Herro over Cade & LaVine. & I'd take Garland over Herro 100%. There's little argument for me for either option.

That leaves Hali/Dame/Ball/Trae. All have strong cases over one another & it just depends on preference + what you value more. For me, he is cut short based on the competition with Garland + either Dame/Hali over him. But that also changes nothing about his season.

HE is an All-Star calibre player. He HAS played like an All-Star. With the improvements that he made & how it all has translated for this season, especially considering the circumstances & the situation, he has taken huge steps & growth.

**So, to answer the question, he has played like an All-Star this year**

**Let me know your thoughts on his case & if you have him over these guards too! Thanks for reading & I appreciate you taking the time if you got to the end**",155,69,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1icwt52/is_tyler_herro_playing_like_an_allstar_this_year/,2025-01-29 10:48:13,"I think he’s an All Star. 

The Heat have a better record than the Pistons and Hawks, with Herro also being guarded tightly and being leagues above Cade and Trae in scoring 62.2% TS for Tyler vs 54.7% and 55.8% for Young and Cunningham whilst being a good playmaker himself. 

Herro’s stats are similar to Dame, but I give the edge to Herro based on the fact that his team are only three games behind the Bucks while Dame doesn’t have the attention of a first option the other guys do.

LaMelo I don’t think is worth consideration. || He is but there’s like 8 guards that’s are deserving this year which is irritating because the East frontcourt players have been lacking this season. Someone like Jaylen Brown will get an All-Star spot not because he’s played like one but because there isn’t a deep selection of players he’s competing with unlike Herro. || [removed] || When you look at his numbers and the whole butler situation, it feels like he deserves it because now he’s getting the full attention as a number one too. Yet I doubt he finds a spot with the amazing guard play in the east || Herro is playing really well and I would say he is near all star level.  Dame, Young, will be above him.  With the Drama surrounding Butler the coaches will probably take Maxey, Cade, Haliburton or Ball over him as well.  They might also lump Brown in as a guard.

I would put him at near all star and not all star play.  His points are good 24 PPG but not great 25+ or amazing 30+ and his assists are fairly weak at 5.4. He is having a great season and is significantly improved, but he has not been a top 5-6 guard in the East.  Doesn’t mean he isn’t very good though

Hali does not deserve it AT ALL no arguments can be made for him imo, his team is playing better because of their defense bye isn't contributing that much too anyways. Ball is hurt, again, and team sucks so those 2 should get him out. I think dame will get in by being dame (not saying my opinion here) so that just leaves maxey and herro and I think herro is more deserving especially since maxey is inefficient || Hero is okay player. No Heat player should be on the All Star team. Heat is sitting at the 7th spot. .500 teams need to focus on winning not sending players to screw off on All Star weekend.
Heat has done Butler wrong! || The Heat also have had the luxury of having Bam and Jimmy (distraction for most of the season)- which is why they have a better record than the Pistons. And the Pistons have beat them twice already.  || Hey. I don’t think his stats are comparable to Damian Lillard. As a second option, Dame is still drawing noticeably more attention than hero (check gravity measurements) and still putting up noticeably higher points per game and assists numbers. Im not really sure your point about them being down by three games and that correlating to herro being better. I do but it’s a very odd point to make.

I strongly disagree. || cade clears. he’s ahead of him in every single stat while having 0 help on his team. this is the same team that was the worse team i. the league and. one of the worst teams ever. and he turned them into a playoff contender. there team records are almost identical so that’s a non factor. cade also draws way more attention than him since his second option is jaden ivey compared to bam adebayo. i also think dame is slightly better but it’s really close and it’s just an opinion thing || Brown is also a proven commodity || Our sub is for in-depth discussion.

The Pistons did beat us twice. Interestingly enough in one of the two games Miami lost, Herro went 40/5/8 with 1 turnover on 72% Ts compared to Cade’s 21/7/9 with 7 turnovers on 58% TS - highlighting that even when Herro played better than Cade, thr results may not reflect it. || Jimmy hasnt played this season so calling that a luxury is hilarious, not to mention how putrid Bam has been on offense, teams literally don't guard bam. You should check out some Heat games to get a better look at Herro imo || - Dame 25/5/7 62% TS
- Herro 24/6/5 62% TS

Pretty comparable numbers in my view. Herro is a first option though, so I give him more credit. I wouldn’t say a ppg difference of 1.2ppg is noticeably higher.

I think being a 48 win pace team is quite an underachievement for an All Star playing with a multiple time MVP in their prime, so I don’t give too much credit there. || Bam isn’t a very good offensive player, he’s not much better than Jarrett Allen.

The team at the epicenter of the recent Dončić deal is no stranger to catching breaks. In addition to already having Kobe, Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum, the Lakers decided to bolster their lineup even further by getting 27-year-old All-Star Pau Gasol from Memphis for the hefty price of... *Kwame Brown?* Okay, that wasn't all they had to give up; also involved were a couple role players, a couple 1sts, and Pau's brother Marc, oddly enough. But overall, this felt like a downright unfair deal as Pau served as a key piece for three consecutive Finals appearances and two championships for the poor, poor Lakers.

The Grizzlies weren't the most egregious losers out of the trade though, considering the other Gasol ended up being a defensive cornerstone of their franchise for a solid decade.



# #4: Moses Malone, in and out of Philly

  
I couldn't decide which terrible Moses Malone trade to include in the top 5, so why not both?

Our ire must first be directed to the Houston Rockets for shipping the then-26-year-old reigning MVP to the 76ers for 32-year-old center Caldwell Jones and a 1st round pick that turned into Rodney McCrae. McCrae ended up being a solid player for the Rockets, but they certainly didn't get enough out of the deal, as Moses would go on to win a second consecutive MVP in his first year with Philadelphia and sweep the Lakers in the 1983 Finals. However, the Rockets ended up falling forward rather quickly by drafting Ralph Sampson in '83 and Hakeem Olajuwon in '84, so they weren't barren at the center position for very long.

The 76ers obviously didn't learn from their past trade partner's mistakes, as a slightly more injury-prone Malone on the other side of 30 was traded to the Washington Bullets (along with Terry Catledge and two 1sts) for All-Star center Jeff Ruland and Cliff Robinson (not to be confused with Clifford Robinson). Neither of those players panning out coupled with Moses still having a few elite seasons left in the tank was a recipe for disaster for Philadelphia.



# #3: Charles Barkley to the Suns

  
We stay in Philly to laugh at the Sixers once again for trading a generational front court talent for peanuts. Charles Barkley--an oft-maligned player at the time--was a perennial MVP candidate when he was dealt to Phoenix in 1992 for Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry, and Andrew Lang. Hornacek is generally underrated and had a better career than his sole All-Star appearance would suggest, but his time in Philly was too short-lived to justify even a fraction of the deal. Meanwhile, Perry and Lang were underwhelming front court role players that also didn't last long for them. They missed the playoffs for six consecutive seasons following the trade.

The Round Mound of Rebound--the Prince of Pizza--went on to win an MVP in his first year with the Suns, leading them to the Finals in the process.



# #2: Back-to-back Thunderous fleeces

  
I'm cheating again by including two trades in one, but this pair felt too rich to ignore in tandem.

In the 2019 offseason, the Clippers decided to sink into win-now mode by signing Kawhi Leonard (fresh off a Finals MVP with Toronto) and trading for another elite two-way player in Paul George. And to be fair, PG13 ended up being great for the Clippers... when he was on the court. The horrendous nature of the deal comes more from what they gave up to get him: *five* 1st round picks, two 1st round pick swaps, Danilo Gallinari, and oh yeah, *Shai Gilgeous-Alexander*. OKC got a massive haul for their former star in draft capital alone, but given what we know now about how SGA (who was then only 20 years old) would pan out for them, this ended up being a generational fleece by the Thunder.

And Presti didn't stop there. The very next day, he shipped off his other superstar in Russell Westbrook to the Rockets for Chris Paul, two 1sts, and two 1st round pick swaps. At the time, FiveThirtyEight publicly stated that the deal would be bad for Houston *even without the draft picks*. Despite putting up an All-Star season with the Rockets, Westbrook would be traded to the Wizards for John Wall and a 1st the very next season. CP3 also only stayed with the Thunder for a season, but had an arguably better year than Westbrook (finishing 7th in MVP voting).

When the dust settled on these back-to-back blockbusters, both the Clippers and the Rockets ended up much worse off long-term, and still continue to be as time goes on.



# #1: Wilt Chamberlain, in and out of Philly

  
I'm sensing a theme here. I guess the 76ers have always had a knack for this sort of thing.

Wilt Chamberlain was otherworldly in the closest to literal sense imaginable. He won MVP as a rookie with the San Francisco Warriors in 1960. He averaged over 50 ppg in 1961-62. He scored 100 points in a game. Then suddenly, in the middle of the 1964-65 season, Wilt was dealt to the 76ers in exchange for Paul Neumann, Connie Dierking, Lee Shaffer (who retired after the trade), and $150,000. Neumann and Dierking were solid players, but that's as far as I'll go. There's nothing else to say about this inexplicable deal. Wilt would go on to win three straight MVPs in Philly, and lead them to a title in 1967 where they would defeat none other than the Warriors in the Finals. SFW thankfully came across Rick Barry soon after the trade, and he would eventually lead them to a title in 1975.

Wilt though, as generational as he was, was no stranger to sour relationships. He eventually grew tired of Philadelphia and wanted out, so he was dealt to the Lakers in the offseason directly following his trio of MVPs. In return, the Sixers received Darrall Imhoff, Jerry Chambers, and Archie Clark. Clark ended up being pretty solid for Philly, and Imhoff was a former All-Star, but of course, the 76ers were big losers here. The Lakers would go on to pair Chamberlain with Jerry West, where they would go 1-3 in the Finals over the last five years of his career.



# Conclusion

  
Where do you think the Luka trade will rank when it's all said and done? I'm not sure myself, but even if the deal somehow works out swimmingly for the Mavericks, it's easy to say that it probably beats all of the above trades in terms of shock value. And much like most of these, a title or two would add some serious salt to the wound for Dallas.

Are there any other trades you feel deserve to be on this list?

Thanks for reading!",95,92,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ig4cqi/top_5_worst_trades_in_nba_history/,2025-02-02 13:47:59,"The Brooklyn Nets essentially traded Tatum, Brown, and Kyrie for Pierce and Garnett. Garnett averaged about 6 PPG in his ~100 games in Brooklyn. Pierce about 13/2/4 in his 75 games in Brooklyn. Imo the most lopsided trade in NBA history. 

Robert Parish and Kevin McHale for Joe Barry Carol and Rickey Brown should be on the list too. || As an OKC fan, you gotta include the Harden trade. Fresh of a finals run, we trade a key piece (and future MVP) just because ownership was cheap. That shit stills haunts us || Personally I don’t really count the clips trade for PG. Kawhi wasn’t signing without the guarantee they’d get another star. What they gave up looks much more reasonable if you consider it to be for both PG and Kawhi.

Didn’t work out of course, but it wasn’t a terrible move by itself. || You can't have the worst trades ever without the Robert Parish trade, Gail Goodrich forced compensation, and the Kareem trade. 

 #1 pick for Robert Parish and the #3 pick. The #1 pick was Joe Barry Carroll and the #3 pick was Kevin McHale. Celtics picked up two HOFers for Joe Barry Carroll, who made 1 AS game. 

Also the forced compensation from the NBA to the Lakers for Gail Goodrich worked as a trade. Gail tore his achilles and was never the same. The Lakers got the pick that became Magic Johnson. 

27yo Kareem was traded for four guys that collectively made 2 all star games. Lakers went on to win 5 Championships with Kareem. || You're using hindsight to judge the PG13 trade. At the time it was seen as a great trade because they were able to pair Kawhi with another All NBA guy. Labeling this a bad trade because Kawhi kept getting hurt and SGA became much better than anyone expected isn't a good way to evaluate the pieces. || Honorable mention to the Pistons trading Chauncey Billups for the ghost of Allen Iverson || Some of these trades were high risk moves that just didn't work out. Clips went all in they just busted. Other trades the players wanted out and or complicated the trade market. Barkley didn't want to stay in Philly.

Neither of those can be said about this trade. For all intents and purposes, Luka wanted to stay in Dallas. He wanted to be the next Dirk. 

Neither is the trade a long-term gamble for the short-term. Does AD raise the Mav's ceiling? The defense in the Finals is overhated. The Mavs played the best defense out of all four Celtic opponents. The problem was that the offense just died in the Finals. Live ball rebounds and turnovers lead to fast-breaks and mismatches. Does AD change that? 

Even looking at just the Western conference, does AD ensure you beat the thunder? The thunder defense thrives at being just big enough, while turning you over on the perimeter. Does making Kyrie the sole point guard solve the turnover issue? 

Not to mention AD is also made of glass, and he is 32 yrs old. || The Pau trade only looked bad in the moment bc people didn’t know what Marc was (grizz were really high on him) and bc it was obvious the Lakers had championships incoming. The grizzlies 100% do that trade again if they are given a time machine and the choice to take it back. Pau had proven to not be a first option that could come through in crunch time while being good enough to keep the record average enough not to get good picks while never really competing with the top dogs. On the other hand, he might have been the best 2nd option in the league at the time, so pairing him with Kobe was magic (and so fun to root against). || Garnett + Pierce to the Nets deserves at least an honorable mention. Celtics championship winning core isn't there without that trade. the Nets were in purgatory for years afterwards, though the failed KD, Harden, Kyrie superteam I guess distracts from that. || It's not ""the worst"" but worth mentioning how the Clippers gave up an unprotected first round pick to get rid of Baron Davis' contract, and in return they got Jamario Moon and Mo Williams. The unprotected first round pick became the 1st overall pick which became Kyrie Irving. It's true that the odds of that pick being 1st overall were low, but that's another example of why some GM's have to be careful with cap dumps.

In this alternate timeline: The Clippers would've had Griffin, Jordan, and Irving all on the same team. Which means CP3 probably becomes a Laker. The Clippers' championship window is (probably) open a little bit longer. The Cavs don't build around Kyrie and instead build around Tristan Thompson. LBJ probably goes back home but without Irving it makes the East more wide open than it originally was. I say in this situation, the Cavs are the real losers given Kyrie was instrumental in their 2016 title win.

The course of history would've changed more drastically than some people think. || The bucks trading Ray Allen for an old disgruntled Gary Payton is somewhere on a list. Maybe not top five, but somewhere. || Where's the Vince Carter trade on here? Also where's the Boston Celtics fleecing the Nets for KG and Pierce?

The Pau Gasol trade was a win win for both sides so that doesn't count. || St Louis trading bill Russell to the Celtics isn't the worst but probably stings the most, especially for the area of st louis. The Hawks then went to the finals that same year only to lose to the Celtics. The Hawks did win the next year over the Celtics, being the only team to beat Russell in the finals, but it ended up turning the Celtics into a dynasty. The Hawks end up losing to the Celtics 2 more times and moved to Atlanta just before Russell retired.

That 1 win prevents it from being the worst trade in NBA history but it's probably still the best trade in history for one team. || The Mavs have to win it all this year or this trade goes down as the worst ever || The problem with including us on this list is that Grizz fans would make this trade again. 

Trades should be judged once all the pieces are slotted and fall into place. || I don't know if this would rank on anyone's all-time worst trades list, but the Cavaliers trading Ron Harper for Danny Ferry deserves a mention. The Cavs had championship-level potential at the time and they were never the same after that trade. Ron Harper went on to be a part of the Bulls dynasty of the 90's and Danny Ferry never came anywhere near the player the hype around him out of college would have suggested. || Ray Allen for around 20 games of Garry Payton. We traded an up and coming star for a half season rental of declining star. Is definitely top 5 worst trade. || Moses Malone out of Philly wasn’t even the worst trade that day by the 76ers. 

76ers Trade: #1 Pick in 1986 NBA draft.

Cavs Trade: Roy Hinson. 

They decided to move on from Moses, whatever,  he had 4 more good years and I can understand wanting to get younger. Bad trade in what they got and gave up, but I get that one to a degree. 

They then decide to trade away their best chance at replacing him to pick up Roy fing Hinson. And that draft was one with a clear #1 pick in Brad Daugherty. Barkley would have had a legit #2 option to play with. || I will die on the hill that the Pau trade wasn’t that bad. The grizzlies got a young Marc Gasol and Kwames contract was expiring. And that led to them signing Zach Randolph. || How are the Stepien trades not on this list? They were so many a new rule was created. || I stopped reading after the first one. Marc was arguably better than Pau for a few years and they got two firsts. For the COST it was hugely lopsided for Memphis || The Clippers would not have gotten Kawhi if not for the PG deal. PG deal is not good in hindsight, was good at the time and it could not be forseen that Shai would turn out like this. || The trade that brought Kobe to the Lakers was one of the worst trades in NBA history as well. || We need to see if the rumour that Luka is 122kgs is actually true. He already struggled with weight and this would be an increase of what, 10-15 kilos on top of his injury? I don't think it justifies the movement but it might not be as tragic as people say || Luka trade isn't bad at all considering he forced his way to the Lakers. Given that, Mavs did amazing || Holiday Lillard. Miles Whiteside. WestBrick KCP RJ. Luka AD. Crazy to think you can be the 1 or 2 seed and you make a crazy trade like these. How to go from the top to mids || [removed] || They didn't have Brown and Tatum, though. They got incredibly unlucky with the draft so the trade looks way worse than it actually was. It was an overpay for aging stars, but we saw the worst case scenario. || >The Brooklyn Nets essentially traded Tatum, Brown, and Kyrie for Pierce and Garnett

It was arguably even worse than that. A shitty lopsided trade like that sucks, but the loser can usually bottom out and rebuild through the lottery over a few seasons; the Nets became a bottom-feeder that didn't own their own 1st rounder for FOUR STRAIGHT YEARS, so they couldn't even tank to get out of hell. Utter hopelessness for that franchise for half a decade. || Yes but indirectly.",0.414,0.404,0.182,-0.5106,0.076,0.832,0.092,0.9606,0.095,0.777,0.128,0.997

First of all people need to respect AD, one of the best two way players on this earth. Secondly, the mavs clearly weren’t interested in acquiring a haul of picks. Nico said he wants to win now so what are some better options that would’ve made sense for both teams?

I believe that Wemby Shai Jokic and maybe Giannis are all untouchable. The fallout from trading away any of these four would be too much. So that leaves you with Tatum (who i’d argue is untouchable) Steph, KD, D Book, Ja, Lebron, Lamelo, and Cade? Are any of these players a better option than AD? I don’t think so.

The best move would’ve been to not do the trade. But if the Mavs were deadset on trading Luka before the deadline and entering win now mode, I think AD was the best option for that.

That's why this is so shocking to everybody.


They could've at least waited til the offseason. || Shit they left another first round pick, Reaves and Knecht on the table. Absolutely insanely horrible even if Luka had demanded a trade to the Lakers specifically, when you factor in that Luka didn’t even ask out at all and it’s pretty clearly the worst trade in sports history which is insane to say 12 hours after it’s been made. || Maybe but that’s an insanely stupid box to put yourself in to begin with. I know I am making my team worse but I’m still win now dammit! || Look, I'm a Lakers fan so I appreciate the Mavs going easy on us, but put yourself in Lakers' shoes. If Mavs came back before the trade consummated and asked for another FRP, another few SRPs, or another piece (maybe Reaves, Vando, or Rui) that can be helpful to your run or further flipped, do you really say no to getting Luka Doncic?

So yes, maybe AD was the best they could've gotten as a headliner, but I think the package overall could've been better and thus appear less lopsided. I don't know what kind of hard ball Rob Pelinka played, but I know Nico Harrison shouldn't have gone along with it. || No they could not have , they wanted to slant defense + they got a Top 7-8 player. || Even if Doncic had to be traded, they should have taken the Lawers for everything, and Pelinka would have been happy to oblige. All the Lakers available 1st round picks should have been gotten, including Reaves and Knect. If you Don't want those guys trade them to another team for more picks. || People really underrate defense a lot and so AD is also always severely underrated || For starters they could have easily gotten Reaves and an extra pick from LA. AD + Reaves + 2FRPs isnt anywhere near as bad. 

AD is kinda redundant, they already have great rim protection and help defense, they need ball handling, playamking and over the top shotmaking, all of which Luka was responsible for. 

Their main issue is now Kyrie is the only player on the entire team that can reliably create his own shot in the playoffs. He is now also responsible  for creating everyone else's shots too. Their starting 5 will have 3 non shooters and 3 non creators. AD and Kyrie will be entirely responsible for the offense and I think that is too much of a role for them to handle.

AD is good, but overall they would have been better with like Ja + Bane or JJJ. I think Franz + picks would have been better. Cade + picks too. Basically any young star with superstar potential + picks to make other deals would have been superior to AD. || There are probably only 4 players in the NBA who their team would not trade straight up for Luka: Jokic, SGA, Giannis, Wemby.  Maybe throw Tatum on that list, although I think the Celts would do this because of the money difference since Tatum's supermax starts next year.  So anybody second team All-NBA and lower would be fair game, and most of them are younger than AD.  Jaylen Brown?  Done.  Anthony Edwards?  Done.  Devin Booker?  Done.  DMitch?  Done.  Want a younger player with star defensive ability on a cheaper contract?  Evan Mobley, Chet Holmgren, Bam Adebayo, Jaren Jackson Jr wouldn't be untouchable for Luka. || I really don't think so -- like, the five untouchables you named and Luka is the full list of players I'm confident are better than AD right now. Out of the guys who are around as good as AD, a good number are small guards you wouldn't want to pair with Kyrie, and then even if other players like KD, Ant, Mitchell, and Booker would probably fit fine next to Kyrie, I don't think it's crazy to prioritize a defensive number one and hope your role players can step up into slightly bigger offensive roles.

That said, they're probably supposed to trade one of Lively or Gafford now, and it probably would've been nice for them to get another asset to use there || They could have easily secured the Mavs current AND future rosters with the haul Luka would have provided. Either Nico Harrison smoked too much crack and hit ""send"" on trade or there is some weird shit going on behind the scenes that is currently being kept secret. || The best package they could've gotten is no package because you don't trade luka doncic || That's like saying Miami should've traded LeBron for Paul  Pierce after losing in 2011 because he would've been a better fit. 

How on earth are you declaring win-now mode by trading a guy like Luka Doncic? Who led you to the finals with PJ as his third option, who wasn't even a third option in Charlotte? || Giannis is 100% tradable if you're getting Luka in return. Dallas got absolutely fucked in this deal, its been reported they didn't even get everything they wanted from the Lakers that's how bad it was || Yes, because even if they ended up doing the deal with the Lakers, if they had courted bids from the entire league, it would have forced the Lakers to improve their bid. It is preposterous to complete that trade and not also have AR-15 or Dalton Knecht. When you have a highly valued asset, you leverage it in the market even if you have a particular partner in mind.

We're talking about an individual who can have an billion+ dollar impact on your franchise, and the bidding process couldn't even get a Sotheby's auction treatment. || “The fallout from trading away any of these four would be too much” - you, actively defending trading away the only other person you could add to this list || If you're in win-now mode you build around your star, you don't trade him for a worse player. I don't even see how they're better in the short-term so I'm baffled. Their ceiling feels much lower to me. 


Teams without a reliable shot-creator and playmaker don't have championship aspirations, and while Kyrie is very good in certain ways he's a 32 year old who has never proven he can be an effective first option on a contender so I don't understand why they think he'll suddenly become one.


AD is probably underrated in all of this but it really feels like you smashed a couple 1B players together and hoped for the best when you already had a top 3 franchise cornerstone in the league on the roster.


I guess what it comes down to is: you have a 25 year old first team All-NBA player. Why are you in ""win now"" mode when your goal should be to win a championship with him within the next 5-7 years?


One of the things I keep telling myself about Luka is that he is still young enough that we may not have seen the best version of him yet. Usually there's a year 26-28 year old leap for the real superstars so the next level for the franchise could have been that Luka started to address the few faults that he had and reached an even higher level. Lebron truly ascended at age 27, that second year on Miami. What if Luka was destined for a similar leap and the Mavericks sold low right before Luka really peaked? Why bet against him?


That's a long way of saying: the win-now move may have been to do nothing or try to improve on the margins. Or try to spin Kyrie into a different piece if you feel that you need to. || They should've gotten at least 4 FRPs. I mean didn't the Knicks spend 5 for bridges just this last summer? Or the gobert trade?  || I’m a rockets fan and I’m upset, they didn’t even talk with other teams that would’ve given them anything. Nico is in the lakers or Adam silvers pocket bc this a joke and I feel for Mavs fans || Since nobody knows what other teams would have been willing to pay for Luka, it’s impossible to give a serious answer. But if you look at what has been paid for stars in the last 10 years, especially 5 years, you get the feeling that it was too cheap. There should have been at least 2 more valuable picks. || They could have asked to more teams, they have just asked to two teams.. Shitshow.. || It's not win now

They lost an mvp candidate who took them to the finals
They missed out on assets for no reason

Stop believing everything you hear

That's what they want

This is corruption || yeah ad and 5 picks sets you up way better to tool around your all-in roster than ad max christie and 1 pick || If I was them I would have tried to get two next up players, who you can see are going to be great, I don't think Orlando would have done Paolo + Franz but something of that vein || They could have gotten, AD, Reaves, and both first round picks at least lol || They could have done better while still trading with the Lakers. They left picks and players on the table. || But no one can name what this magical better deal would even look like haha || Off season for sure would have been better || The fact that they didn't even get knecht who looks like he's going to be a legit player is what really sells me on the conspiracy that Nico is actually in the Lakers pocket some how. || Fr force Lakers to trade Reaves/Rui for whatever and picks and get those picks too. Squeeze every asset you can. Maybe even just send Klay for Reaves straight up. Send them Hardy and get all of their youth. Get swap on every single FRP they have.

Everybody has been losing their minds over the return for Luka. I'm a laker fan and I won't pretend we didn't get a steal of a deal. We obviously did. This thread is not about how unfair the deal was, as no deal that sends Luka out will be balanced. 

All the feelings and outrage are valid. However, I find some of the loudest objections to be vague and speculative. Everyone seems to believe that there was a better deal with the Mavs goals in mind. I'm willing to be convinced. That's what I'd like to explore. 

This thread is not about how stupid it is to pass on extending Luka. This thread is not for guessing at conspiracy theories. This is not about more undeserved slander at AD, a legit top 10 force who has been talked about like he's a dying Hassan whiteside about to go bad in the fridge (btw he is going to be incredible next to Kyrie and Lively/gafford). Check any of the other threads for a healthy dose of that.

Nico Harrison and the Mavs have talked about wanting to win now and make a dominant pairing for the next 3-4 years. They said that they chose the deal they wanted and operated in silence to avoid a circus. Most don't agree with this, many don't buy that spin, and this has obviously been a fiasco. However, at least it hasn't been drawn out like with Jimmy and the Heat, or Jimmy and the wolves, or Dame and the Blazers, or AD and the pelicans, or Kawhi with the Spurs. We could go on and on. Those teams really couldn't max their value or get the deal they wanted, and the player had plenty of control, which is far from desirable when your priority is to Win Now and not to rebuild yet. That's a valid concern. As upset as Mavs fans rightfully are right now, their team is still ready to win now and that's hard to keep hating for long.

So let's follow the premise: You are Nico and the Mavs. You want to keep this quick and clean. You want to pick the deal you want and just make it happen. You don't want a public auction because you don't want to let anyone influence the end result, which you have seen go wrong several times in recent years. You want to win now with Kyrie and the rest of the squad you've got. You're super done with Luka and ownership is with you.

You can basically take your pick, but they have to be available in that deal. Joker, Shai, and Wemby are not going to be available, and likely not giannis either. The Cavs, Celtics, Thunder, and Knicks probably don't want to rock the boat. The Grizz may consider swapping Ja for Luka, but otherwise they'd be too redundant having them both if the mavs get JJJ instead. I don't think they would do it. I doubt the wolves move Ant for Luka though it's not impossible to imagine, just unlikely. I doubt the Mavs value Booker over AD. Outside of that, I struggle to find a Win Now deal better than a package around AD. Maybe the package could've been squeezed for a few more drops, but then you risk losing control of the situation and having a dragged out circus. So...

Who exactly do you want that's actually going to be available to you? Who fits with this squad? Based on who you perceive as relatively available, who are you asking for?

OR

You are the GM of your favorite team. You heard that there's a silent auction for Luka. You leak => No Luka for you. The Mavs only want Win Now offers. What's your best offer?




EDIT: Welp, this was fun. A lot of you wanted to debate about whether or not Nico properly squeezed the Lakers, so to all of you, let me say one final time, I agree that Nico did a shit job and, even given these circumstances, should have done better than he did with the Lakers. 

I agree with many of you that an open auction could have, at the least, gotten the Mavs Knecht, Reaves, and more picks. Totally true. It's also clear that Nico and ownership accepted that the cost of a silent process was not optimizing the margins of the package. Agree or disagree all you want, but considering how he is being talked about right now, if you are Nico and committed to moving on from Luka, silence is probably the safest choice, in which backlash comes in one haymaker instead of a drawn out war. Instead, he got to choose his guy, and that's what he did. In other comparable Big Star trades, the team trading the star out rarely gets who they wanted. That's big. 

As far as other offers go, I'm not going to do the due diligence of looking up who has what number of picks, but here's a list of packages that you guys suggested that I felt might be worth the Mavs interest. I did not include many Max Christie types, as our conversations were largely about the core level of the package

OKC Chet + JDub 
BOS Jaylen Brown, Derek White, Jrue Holiday
MIN Ant
HOU Amen + Jabari + Alpie + Jalen
CLE Mobley + Garland 
MIA Bam + Herro
MEM JJJ + Bane
ORL Paolo + Franz + Suggs + WCJ
PHI Maxey + PG + McCain
CHA Miller

Of these, I think that only some are plausible. I don't think OKC, BOS, HOU, MEM, CLE or NYK want to shake up their success by bringing in a player who is going to change their entire offensive identity and defensive vulnerability. I think MIN is resistant to letting go of Ant for Luka, as they are probably more confident in Ant staying than Luka. 
That leaves ORL, CHA, and PHI. And if I'm the Mavs trying to win now, those are the most risky for winning now. If I choose anything other than the Lakers package, it's probably ORL. But even then, I think the AD package would be better. 

Thanks for participating, everyone!",33,157,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ih58jy/your_best_win_now_offer_for_luka_doncic/,2025-02-03 19:50:32,"I find the logic of wanting to win now and trading Luka to be slightly incongruent, he just helped them get to the finals, - Davis doesn’t make them more of a contender than they were before and so it doesn’t really make sense from that front and therefore if you’re trading away Luka your priority should be maximizing returns.    

JJJ and Bane would be an intriguing framework for a deal, Bam and Herro is another one, Chet and Williams and picks is another I’d consider.   

Even if you were set on Davis that package was not the best you could do at minimum you should be adding Reaves and potentially Knecht and the other pick || I don't think the issue is AD. He is a great piece in a Luka trade. I dont think there is a better player that is available.

I think the issue is that they didn't get anything else.
I would have expected all the 1st, all the seconds, all the swaps that the Lakers can do. 

I would also expect a Dalton or Reaves or both. 

Even if Luka and AD were identical players, AD being 6 years older, is worth more than one 1st. || I think the problem is with the starting premise. That it has to be a win now move, and that it has to be kept secret. Why?

I think from the reporting its clear Niko Harrison wanted AD and no one else and that was the entire premises. That he valued AD higher, likely than anyone on earth. That's the only explanation of how you let Rob Pelinka finesse you out of Dalton Knecht and the 2031 pick at the last minute and don't call a single other team or tell him to get lost. Somehow the Lakers seemed to have the leverage here.

Rob Pelinka is trying to play hard ball about the 2031 pick and Dalton Knecht and you don't even make a call about Chet? Palo? Mobley? JJJ? Amen Thompson? Hell, call the Bucks up about Giannis lol. This entire process was malpractice. || I think honestly as the Mavs I'd still likely get AD, but also include Reaves, to either play SG or as a 6moy type player. I think the mavs are constructed well but definitely lacking a 2nd off the dribble creator. Or even potentially get a 4th team involved to get the lakers to deal Reaves and or knecht plus a pick to aquire another win now player.

On the other hand, as a wolves fan, I don't think we trade ANT. We probably offer something absolutely terrible around randle and the few picks we have, but hey with nico on the line who knows. || I think the Celtics could have logically offered Brown and Prichard and a couple of firsts and it feels as good as the deal at the very least. Throw in Holiday and I’m still fine with it. || The only teams that make sense to trade for Luka without any way for the receiving GM to get assurances that Luka would be interested in re-signing would be the Lakers, Clippers, Heat, and maybe the Knicks.  Without the supermax on the table, Luka gets equal money signing with any team in 2026, and should only ask for a 2+1 deal to maximize his earnings.  That depresses his value compared to trading him after he's signed a supermax extension and is under contract for 5 years. Maybe a team like Memphis or OKC that traded for him could get a return in a S&T if he doesn't want to re-sign, but maybe the Lakers just clear cap space and sign him outright in 2026.  Is it worth Jalen Williams and 5 FRP if the Thunder only get 1+ seasons of Luka and have to hope he wants to stay?  It's not an easy question to answer.

Within those limitations, Anthony Davis is the best player the Mavs could acquire for Luka.  He's better than Kawhi or Harden, better than Jimmy Butler, better than KAT or Brunson.  I think a lot of the outrage comes from the fact that the Lakers emptied out the asset chest for Davis; two #2 picks on rookie deals, the #4 pick, a solid starter on a cheap contract, and 3 additional first round picks.  In comparison, AD, Max Christie and a single FRP seems inadequate, when the Mavs could have gotten Knecht and a second FRP without anybody saying ""wow, the Mavs won this deal."" || The problem is we don't know if Luka would be willing to re-sign in most cities. I think that rules out OKC, CLE, DET, MEM, ORL, etc. since they wouldn't want to take that risk.

Given that I think AD is probably the best individual player they could have come away with. || AD is one of the better win now moves for sure. But there were better opportunities to be comparably win now without sacrificing their entire future. Which this trade did, given there future draft picks. But I’ll take a crack at all the realistic (maybe semi realistic) offers that I think would have still allowed the Mavs to remain contenders while also having a future.

Obvious answer: trading for AD but also getting Knecht and a pick (if not Reaves as well)

But moving on:

- Celtics: Jaylen Brown + 3-4 firsts - I think Celtics would go for this, but Mavs get a 2 way star and future assets (slightly less win now than they were with Luka)
- Heat: Bam Adebayo + Tyler Herro - Mavs get a top tier defensive center and an offensive weapon (imo would be a better team than current)
- Magic: Paulo/Franz + Suggs + 2 firsts - Get a young rising star, a young two way defensive star, and future assets (slightly less win now)
- 76ers: Embiid + Mccain + 1 first or Maxey + 3 firsts - Embiid is still a MvP caliber player when healthy, imo better than AD, obviously major health concerns but what result in a serious discount where Mavs could get Mccain and a future draft asset. Also could be a Maxey move plus future assets
- Thunder: Chet + 4 firsts - I think Thunder at the very least consider this, Mavs would be less win now than with AD but would be win now for a significantly longer period
- Grizzlies: JJJ + Bane - Young two star in JJJ, and Bane is a borderline all star caliber player. Would improve their lineup for years to come 
- Nuggets: Jamal Murray + MPJ + 4-5 firsts (add Christian Braun also if needed) - I think the Nuggets if they knew Luka was available would have made everything except Jokic available and sent whatever was possibly needed to get it done
- Wolves: Ant + Gobert (maybe needs an additional item from Dallas) - Young superstar and an elite defensive center, I think Wolves would swap Ant for Luka not sure about alongside Gobert
- Suns: Dbook + 3-4 firsts or KD + 4 firsts - Both of these moves would have made Mavs comparably a good enough contender as they were with Luka but also adds assets
- Pelicans: Zion + Herbert Jones + 2 firsts - Obviously this would never go considering conditioning issues are obviously very important to Mavs, but get an elite player out of Zion and a top tier perimeter defender in Herbert Jones plus picks
- Jazz: Markannen + Kessler + 4-5 firsts - 2 young players with enormous potential, and I believe Ainge would have sent a boatload of picks as well

Overall, I think that Heat package would be the winner if we’re talking purely win now as in this season/next season. But if I were a normal GM (as in someone who actually cares about further than 3 years in the future), I’d take all these trades over the current iteration with AD || I guess my issue is I don’t see this as a win now team.  To me they shortened their window.  Kyrie and AD isn’t a pairing I believe in to win a championship.  Selling off a top 5 player and not getting a haul of assets, and instead getting an older player with a history of missing games and seemingly nearing the end of their prime in an attempt to “win now” is the strange part of the trade.  With that being said, if that’s their goal there might not be a better available trade. || I mean this post is just wrong. The biggest problem is that AD necessarily isn't bad, but trading him straight-up for Luka (which is what happened essentially) is a horrible return. I doubt Mavs fans would've been as mad if they got AD + both firsts, 2 swaps, Reaves, Christie, and Knecht for Luka, Kleber, Morris, and a 2nd rounder.

Neither am I completely sold on the fit. Nico Harrison did such a good job of building a team to fit to Luka's strengths/weaknesses, I have no idea why he would dump the centerpiece of the contender he made. Kyrie has always operated best as an off-ball, iso player. He excelled next to Lebron, Luka, and KD/Harden, but struggled when he had to take on the primary facilitator role (Cleveland pre-Lebron, Boston, and Brooklyn when KD was injured/before Harden got there). Gafford/Lively are good roll men, but I doubt Kyrie would be as effective getting them the ball as Luka. AD pretty much plays a similar roll (although much better), but all three of them aren't great floor spacers, and I'm not sure what their go-to half court offensive would be now. I similarly don't think Dinwiddie would be that great running the floor, and the rest of the Dallas core are 3 and D wings. Running lineups of AD + one of Gafford/Lively also pushes PJ to the 3, which I think isn't his strong suit. In sum, the defensive fit seems great, but there's a lot of positional redundancy on offense and not enough facilitating for it to be effective.

In terms of who the Mavs could have gotten from other teams, I'd like to think that anyone outside of Jokic, Wemby, Giannis, Shai, and Tatum were on the table. I doubt Phoenix refuses to trade Booker or that the Twolves would rather have Ant over Luka. Both of them provide better fits imo to how the current Mavs team is built.

I think the bigger question is if the Mavs could have landed multiple great players for Luka. Would the Sixers have been willing to give up PG, Maxey, and McCain? You talk about not wanting to rock the boat, but if the Mavs had asked  for Jdub and Chet, would OKC really have passed on creating the best backcourt in NBA history? Similarly, would Boston have said no if Dallas wanted Brown and White? Would Cleveland have passed on giving up Mitchell and Mobley in return for a proven playoff leader? I know his dad works for the front office, but would the Knicks really value Brunson and OG to the point of saying no to the potential of a generational player? It seems that Nico didn't even ask around regarding these options, and that's even crazier than trading Luka to me. || Maxey, McCain, and picks for Luka? Philly prays for health and would have an insane starting lineup when healthy. Luka and Embiid would be a turbocharged version of Harden and Embiid. For Dallas it gives them a new backcourt of extremely promising young talent. I guess even this is way more of a future plan than a win now though. They would need to make a second trade for a big.

Maybe if the Mavs could've gotten Garland and Jarrett Allen or something. Maybe Mobley and Garland? That feels substantially more fair than what the Mavs actually got. But I kind of doubt the Cavs would want to blow up their squad right now. || Most of what I disagree with when it comes to the trade is the rationale. I don’t think they’re the kind of team to be making a win now trade. If anything, I think they’ve been getting worse over the years and it’s just been covered by Luka getting better.

Given the parameters, I think the Lakers actually have the best offer in this situation with AD, but I would assume Reaves + both picks come back. 

I think Giannis from Milwaukee is worth a call. Their window is shutting rapidly and they’re out of assets. 

On one hand I don’t think the Celtics would want to mess with what they’ve got, but Tatum for Luka 1:1 would probably be good for both sides. 

The Cavs are sitting pretty but they haven’t had post season success really - I would again be careful assuming that they wouldn’t be interested, this is Luka Doncic we’re talking about. I think that goes for most teams, they might not be looking to trade but things change when it’s a franchise level player. Mobley + more is more than reasonable to expect. || The problem is that you are making a ton of assumptions that you wouldn't have to make if they actually shopped the deal like they should have. Beyond Wemby and Jokic do we REALLY know anyone else would be off the table? And w/o talking to Doncic do we know which teams he would give the thumbs up to?

The reality is that with a prize as shiny as Doncic we have no way to know what lengths teams would have gone to get him, but we do KNOW they would have been willing to put up a lot more than what Dallas got. || The Knicks would absolutely sniff around a deal for Luka. I think the Cavs and Celtics would too. || Anything on the roster not named Evan Mobley, and any pick/pick swap we have available. Can't pass on the opportunity to get a guy who, at worst, is a top 5 player in the league. || As a Heat fan, and considering they wanted AD. Jimmy, Bam, a FRP and a couple SRP. Love Bam but it’s Luka, Jimmy is out anyways, and hell the picks could basically be adjusted to almost any amount. || Fun thought experiment! 

For most of these teams, Dallas would also get a bunch of first round picks. I think that is one interesting part is that they could have likely got a good selection of players from one team and picks, then used those picks for another good  player from another team if they really wanted to win now.

Just listing the main players below, Im sure any trade would also include more minor players like Max Christie as well.

Atl- Trae Young, Dyson Daniels, Okongwu

Cleveland- Evan Mobley, Donovan Mitchel,

Miami- Bam, Tyler Herro

Phoenix- Devin Booker, Kevin Durrant

Golden State- Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Kuminga

Memphis- JJJ, Bane,

Houston- Amen Thompson, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr,

NYK- Some combo of Jalen Brunson, KAT, OG, Hart

Orlando- Wagner, Paolo, Goga, Isaac,

**I think OKC would have likely paid the most. A hoard of draft picks, Chet, Jalen Williams, Caruso,Hartenstein what ever other small peices they want. Then they could turn around and sell that hoard of draft picks for another really good player if they wanted to.**

None of these players may be as good as AD individually, but the package of them likely exceeds his value, especially if on top of the players they also received a bunch of draft picks or young players that they could flip to another team for another good player. || Rockets delegation here. Take your pick of the roster and draft assets. Build your own package. || If I'm the Mavs, I call up OKC. I tell Presti ""Luka is on the market, I'm wondering if I could strike a deal here"". I tell Presti I want one of SGA or Holmgren, and at least six of their first round picks. SGA or Holmgren + 6 FRP for Luka is more like a package I'd consider for my franchise player. The Thunder have the assets to pull it off. Slim chance they consider it, but that package is way better than any other team could scrap together. || Totally bullshit thinking AD will bring win now situation than Luka. 

There is no playmaker in this team now and all role players in this team are for Luka doncic. Ad fails to be the #1 guy in lakers, how come you will think it is a good deal for Dallas. Lakers fans are all bias, keep convincing this trade is not stupid for mavs || Might have been able to do jokic and mpj for like their 5 and Luka but it really makes no sense and would never happen ||  there isn’t one, Luka at his best is top 3 in the league or even top 2. 

For a long term solution I’d have tried to get a young blue chipper (ie; Brandon Miller, Franz/Paolo, etc), another solid young piece, another flippable piece to turn into more pieces, on top of a boaaaaaaatload of picks. || Here is the best ""win now"" scenario for the Dallas Mavericks:

Keep Luka Doncic. || The financials were also important. The deal leaves the Mavs just $171k under the 1st apron and the Lakers $1.6M under the 2nd apron. It's why the Jazz got two 2nd rounders to accept Jalen Hood-Schino's contract. 

The 2nd apron is almost a hard cap in the new CBA. || Not sure I agree with your parameters here.

I’ve seen a lot of people arguing the same as you - “who would they realistically get who would be better than AD to win now?!” But I think it’s a flawed assumption.

Even IF we are putting aside the fact that Luka is obviously still a win now player and you’re just done with him and want him gone *and* you want to compete right now, I still disagree that it has to be a direct trade for a guy like AD.

Say they shop Luka around and there’s an offer for like…8 first round picks or something. You could easily still turn say..3 of those into AD from the lakers. You could get multiple teams involved and make sure you’re getting a good return but that starts to get really messy and complicated.

I think the premise of “oh it really wasn’t that bad, AD is the best guy they could have gotten in return, he lets them compete now!” is still - intentionally or not - giving Nico a pass on the terrible return that he got.

That’s why the deal is so terrible. He *still* could have gotten AD even if that was his dream player. Just with more of a return.

If you want a ham sandwich and don’t have cash on you, you don’t trade a Rolex directly for the ham sandwich. You sell the Rolex, buy the ham sandwich at market price and then pocket the rest (not a perfect analogy because obviously AD isn’t a ham sandwich). || [removed] || I don't disagree that Rob fleeced the Mavs by saving Reaves, knecht and more picks. Agreed there. But I think there's validity in wanting to work in silence so that you don't lose control, and obviously the cost of that silence was being able to fully squeeze the lemon. 

JJJ and Bane - one of the better realistic suggestions, I just struggle to see how Ja and Luka can fit together. But interesting to say the least. 
Bam and Herro - probably the best suggestion, but this honestly might kill Pat Riley's Heat Culture by sending out the gritty guys, bringing in a guy accused of work ethic issues, and still holding the bag on Jimmy
Chet and Williams - I don't think they'd do it. The thunder are absolutely flying and they don't seem to want to rock the boat. I actually think they are just gonna trade 1 upcoming pick for 2 future picks forever and just maintain their stupid stockpile until this core moves on too, and just do iHart/Caruso style deals and keep the core together. || Not really, he has been hurt more than half the year. This is a team that is .5 games from not even being in the play-in, so on that kind of time scale having AD for 30 more games vs. Luka for 20 makes a difference. The Lakers have more of a cushion built in to wait for him to get healthy.

Also the obvious downside of trying to squeeze somebody in a trade like this is they say “nah we’ll just wait to sign him after next season” and then it comes out that you were trying to shop Luka and he’s pissed. 

None of these small-market teams you mention would like their chances of re-signing Luka and it’s not like Memphis in that scenario would be competitive with the top teams in the league. That would be a worse version of the Lakers where they’d have no defense and Ja is a worse fit off the ball than LeBron. Bam and Herro make like $30 million more more than AD + Christie, so that would have required Miami to take a bunch of dead salary while also trading picks when they don’t have any until 2029. That far in advance I would definitely value a Lakers pick over a Heat one just by virtue of the West being tougher.

Bottom line though is that 90 percent of the league will talk a good game but their owners would rather be decent and collect luxury tax than great and pay luxury tax. The Heat were avoiding the luxury tax when they had peak LeBron and it was not nearly as punitive as the 2nd apron is now. || Mavs should have gotten Knecht and the other way round pick at a minimum, then maybe you can justify it. But honestly the fan backlash has nothing to do with the compensation. Luka was Dirks replacement, the Slovenian wonder boy. || Reportedly they were close to getting all that, and Pelinka pushed back to get Knect and the other FRP off the table.  Again, just insanely bad negotiating from Harrison.  As long as the deal was quiet, **he** should have been the one pushing for more.  

Klutch and AD/LeBron are already at odds with LAL, Pelinka is the one that would have taken more initial heat for shopping AD.  Nobody would have believed that DAL was seriously shopping Luka.

—————-

Back to OP’s question.  AD might have been the best individual player he could get back right this minute.

However, two teams stand out to me with better packages and near/mid-term return.  Knicks and Magic.  You want to push in all your chips for flexible defense and two way offense?  OG/Rob from the Knicks or WCJ(or Issac)/Franz from Orlando would be solid return.  Both include guys around top 20, compared to around top 10 AD, and a rim-protector.  Both also have a want/need for an on-ball creator.  Both could put together more draft capital to give the Mavs options for additional moves.

Hell, I could see the Heat offering a better all around package around Bam that would be appealing.  Bam/Jovic/Highsmith for Luka?  They have all their own picks from ‘28-‘31, plus seconds.",0.0,0.429,0.571,0.8402,0.077,0.789,0.134,0.9954,0.073,0.777,0.15,0.9999

Will they make a deep run?,"I've been posting analytics (some of you hate them, but look at how accurate they turned out to be) and other facts here that suggested the Warriors would get 6th soon (check my posts). I missed by a couple of days because of Grimes playing the fakest game of his life. 

Warriors last 10 (8-2)

120.9 OffRtg (3rd; ≈2nd on the season)
107.4 DefRtg (3rd; ≈2nd on the season)
13.5 NetRtg (3rd; ≈1st on the season)

Steph (4) & Jimmy (8) both T10 NetRtg (mins≥28 & usg≥20%). Only CLE has more than 1 T10 Net guy.

Steph: 29.5/4/7 on 51/42/88 splits & 69 TS%. 

Steph only trails Jokic & Shai on offense (per DunksAndThrees). He's also 7th in the league in overall impact (per DunksAndThrees). He's basically 37 years old. No other player in the Top 10 in impact is over 30 (Giannis is 30).

The Warriors are elite again and Steph is quietly having an MVP esque second half to the season at age 37. He also has the most 50 point games after 30. As things progress, we're seeing that Steph has unprecedented longevity. Especially for a small guard. His all-time rankings will continue to climb if he keeps this up.

Warriors are currently ranked 4th on DunksAndThrees, behind OKC, CLE, and BOS. They also have a whopping 17 games with a 55%+ win probability (per DunksAndThrees). Their schedule strength up to this point has been one of the toughest in the league. Their remaining schedule strength is much weaker. The combination of adding Jimmy and facing weaker competition strongly suggests they are likely to hold onto 6th and have a small chance of climbing to 5th.

They're 2-1 vs OKC, 2-1 vs MEM, 2-1 vs HOU, and 3-1 vs MIN. Before Jimmy. Seems that if they avoid potentially tougher matchups like the Lakers and Denver, they could make a big run in the Western Conference and maybe end up in the NBA Finals. Would they then face Boston? With not one, but TWO Celtics Killers in Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler?

However, we still have some glaring holes in our game, and don't really have a clear 3rd scoring option without Kuminga. Quinten Post is getting there as a reliable spacer, so him Jimmy and JK will feast. I hope JK can focus more on 1v1 defense, cause our perimeter defense can do better honestly. || There’s an unlikely reality they end up on the opposite side of the bracket to Nuggets/Lakers and if they’re very lucky OKC too

In that case, I could definitely see it. If they have to go through all 3 of those teams (likeliest outcome if they finish 6 or 7), I’d very seriously doubt it  || In my opinion, we get trashed by OKC, Lakers... and we can compete decently with wolves, nuggets, grizzlies, rockets and clippers. Specifically with the nuggets we can't stop Joker but we can lock down everyone else and make Joker beat us himself. || I think one important thing to mention is that Jimmy does have an injury history, having missed the playoffs last year due to getting injured. Part of that is obviously due to his age. But another part of that is his style of play does usually result in a lot of contact, unlike Steph. 

You can say there is a lot less pressure on him to carry, then there was with the Heat. But even if he somehow makes the finals, I feel like he’d be pretty battered up by the bloodbath that is the West and not really able to perform. That’s what happened 2 years ago in the East, having to go 7 games against the Celtics. Whereas rn the East has two super teams that will have an intense series but otherwise be fresh for the Finals. || They schedule have consisted of bad teams, Milwaukee and Houston being the good teams they faced, and Bucks didn’t have Giannis and Rockets are trending down. Their record right now those mean much, I’d expect them to be 6-4 or 7-3 without Butler anyway, and the Orlando game was Steph being Steph, nothing to do with Butler arriving.

I do like what I’m seeing from them, specially how Steph is rejuvenated not being triple teamed and having more space to operate. They are winning because the offense overpowers teams. However, their offense still lacks shooters, their offensive rebounding could be better. If they have shooters out there, the defense sucks and forces Dray and Jimmy to over rotate. If they add good defenders than there’s just two shooters out there. I think their holes are clearer and mor exploitable than the other top5 teams. I’m putting them in the Bucks tier now, maybe Knicks. || I would never count out Steph or Jimmy butler in the playoffs. It would be crazy but no one thought Jimmy could take a playin team to the finals or that Steph would win with the 2022 team. || It really depends who they get in the first round. If they get 6th, and Denver/LA decide to ease off the gas to let Memphis/Houston face them in the first round, I can see GSW win that series. 

If GSW end up facing Denver or OKC in the first round, I can't see them winning that I'm afraid. 

If it's the Lakers, oh boy give me LeBron v Steph one more time. I do think GSW could win that but it can go either way. || [removed] || Imo they don't need ""too"" many things to go their way for them to make another deep run. They are older now so health will be the number one concern, but if Draymond, Butler, Steph can all stay healthy they will be able to beat any team in a series. Especially if Steph decides he wants to go nuclear, which is a possibility at anytime even at his age. Butler's smart game really complements Steph quite well and Steph can be good with anyone with his elite off ball movement.

Exciting time to be an NBA fan as it's far more than a 2 horse race for the championship. || Not like they have played good teams and when they have their stars have sat. 

Everyone was calling their run after all star break. Don’t they have the weakest schedule? || They played terrible teams in the last 10 lol.

They don’t have one win in that stretch where they weren’t massive favourites. || They have a long battle ahead and the most important thing for them is making sure they have Jimmy and Steph healthy come playoff time. If either one is not at full strength the Warriors are getting cooked by any playoff caliber team, so I would say they are more Cinderella’s ugly sister then a Cinderella || I am worried about the point of attack defence and general shot blocking/rim protecting. Draymond has always been a unique rim protector because he didn’t actually block shots and if the team is big/ athletic then he actually protection at the rim can be exposed but he is a great paint protector he plugs up holes and players don’t even get to the rim. But against the elite teams who have strong rim attacking and finishing I do think it can be a real issue. So draymond offers a supremely unique rim protection but I think there is considerable value of actual shot blocking that he doesn’t offer especially in 2025. I’m interested though. || I think them facing OKC would actually be one of their best bets.

I feel they're a sleeper pick for sure. regardless of what seed they get they have too much playoff experience. Lowkey Klay would be great - despite his meh play, he was an insane threat and quintessential to the 2022 ring || Warriors are dangerous. Draymond is a nightmare to deal with defensively and against someone like Chet, Dray very well could bully him. They have a lot of depth defensively too and of course the loaded front court of Steph curry and break out future all star Podz getting to their spots and Jimmy connecting with the team makes them a tough contender. || It would be nice, but they can’t survive the non-Steph and Jimmy minutes to save a life || [removed] || [removed] || They need to get to 4th or 5th seed.

Sure, Jimmy is good to great but they hardly have scoring outside of these two. If Hield goes on a heater they could be a surprise, but they just look tiny out there and very limited offensively. 

I think they can out hustle people, unless they play Rockets or Thunder. If they can match up against a Clippers team or Memphis team I think they’d win the series. They’d probably hold their own against the Rockets, but it would be brutal given how hard the Rockets play. I’d be shocked if they could beat one of Lakers, OKC, Denver right now. Denver doesn’t seem that much better but they would abuse GS in the paint and it would just be so much easier for them to control the game. 

Again, I hope they make a run. However, they have a huge hill to climb. || I would love that but tbh I don’t see them beating OKC or Lakers. Maybe nuggets, but not Lakers or OKC for sure. 

Yea I’m aware they’ve won already but I mean in playoffs || It's going to be tough because the competition is stiff, but you can never count out Steph. Even though he's a step slower, he can night night any game if he's feeling it and has enough support (screeners and playmakers like Jimmy Buckets to draw some attention). 

Draymond is still somewhat surprisingly effective at what he does and Podziemski's obviously playing well. They have shooting off the bench in Hield and defense in GP2. 

My thing is I don't think they have enough depth. They're like 2 pieces short, especially against teams like the Thunder and Lakers. But can they make it to the WCF and beyond? It's def possible. Playoff Jimmy is a real thing and he never had anyone like Steph || The one thing that makes it hard to evaluate the Warriors is that this core clearly has an X-factor.  They know what it takes to win it all, better than anyone else in the league.  It’s tough to rattle that resolve if you’re an opponent with a theoretical upper-hand || GSW is interesting. They have all the talent they need in the wing and point guard. The problem is they don’t have a consistent big man who can hold his own and not get pushed around in the paint. || They have 3 stars who raise their games in the playoffs and a good coach. As long as they are healthy I expect them to make the WCF. || I think they end up 6th and I think they play the Lakers in the first round and I’m calling an upset. Warriors then play the T wolves who upset the 2 seed Nuggets in the second round and win in 7. Warriors then play a tough series but lose in 5 to the Thunder.  

So yes I see them making a run || Kuminga should be back before the end of the regular season right? || Fifth seed minimum is likely at the current pace. Rockets may not fall enough, but Memphis likely will with JJJ out and a brutal schedule ahead. Not going to say it's a guarantee, but I wouldn't say it's unlikely at all. || We are less than 20 games away and the seedinh looks relatively clear


Okc locked at 1st


Den/lakers 2nd/3rd with a cushion over mem/hou 4th/5th seeds


Gsw and minny with a 3~ losses gap below at 6/7 seeds


Clippers/sac with a small gap below at 8th/9th


Is possible that teams move out of these areas, maybe warriors continud on a war path and overcome the 4th/5th seeds for example but with only 20 games left margins are pretty tight for any of these teams to lose their 2/3 game cushions so dont expect many of them to end out of where they are now


The most likely bracket is okc vs clippers/kings against winner of memphis/rockets


Lakers/denver vs minnesota/clippers in the other side of the bracket || I think the Lakers matchup is more of a tossup, now that AD is gone - he's the guy that always killed the Warriors, and the Lakers have no one that can even pretend to guard Steph or Jimmy. That would be a fun match-up.

Jokic I agree. Can't see Draymond enjoying being tasked with holding off Jokic for extended minutes.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.082,0.831,0.088,0.4857,0.093,0.735,0.172,0.9995

Yes, LeBron is 40 years old, but he's not just coasting – he's putting up a season worthy of MVP consideration, and here's why:

**LeBron is defying Father Time (again!):** Over his last 30 games, he's averaging 26.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 8.2 assists per game. Those are elite numbers for any player, let alone someone with two decades of mileage. He's also shooting efficiently, at 54.7% from the field and 43% from three. And get this: since Luka Dončić joined the Lakers, he's been even better, averaging 28 points and 10.1 rebounds per game!

**Elevating a Flawed Roster:** Let's be real, the Lakers supporting cast was considered weak before Luka arrived. Even now, many consider the team poorly constructed. Despite this, LeBron has kept them competitive in the loaded West. He's the leader of this team, guiding them through inconsistencies and making his teammates better.

**The Three-Way Race (Last 30 Games):**

Here's how LeBron stacks up against the other frontrunners over their last 30 games:

* **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander:** SGA is having an incredible season, leading the league in scoring. Over his last 30, he's averaging 34.7 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 6.5 assists. While his scoring is higher than LeBron's, LeBron edges him out in rebounds and assists while playing with a weaker supporting cast.
* **Nikola Jokic:** The Joker is a triple-double machine. In his last 30 games, he's averaging 26.4 points, 12.1 rebounds, and 11.5 assists. While Jokic leads in rebounds and assists, LeBron is scoring at a similar clip while demonstrating greater leadership and impact on a less balanced team.

**LeBron is making history.** No one in NBA history has ever performed at this level at 40 years old. Karl Malone won MVP at 35, and LeBron is exceeding those numbers. This is unprecedented territory. He already made history last year by becoming the oldest player to win any kind of MVP award when he won the inaugural In-Season Tournament MVP. A regular season MVP would be another legendary milestone.

**Conclusion**

LeBron James is proving that age is just a number. He's not just playing well for a 40-year-old; he's playing at an MVP level, carrying a flawed Lakers team and putting up historic numbers. While SGA and Jokic are having fantastic seasons, LeBron's performance, leadership, and the sheer defiance of his age make him a truly deserving candidate for the 2024-25 MVP award. His stats and greater win-share over the last 30 games prove it:

LeBrons been amazing but let’s be real || If LeBron played the way he currently is all season I'd agree.

No argument for him over SGA or Jokic with only a month and a half of him playing at this level || Being 40 doesn’t make him the mvp. He is simply not as good as Jokic or SGA. Giannis or Tatum too. He’s 5th at best || This is a terrible take. By your logic, if LeBron played until 50, and averaged 10, 5, and 5, should he win MVP then too, because ""holy shit no one has ever played like this at ***50***""? || If he played like this all season then yeah, but he only playing like this because Luka is on the team now || Feels like a Lebron glazing post lmao. Many thing you mention really had nothing to do with MVP and you credit him everything while ignoring AD starting his year as MVP candidate.

Lebron defying father time, perfoming like that at 40...blah blah has nothing to do with MVP voting, and he is not even the clear best player in that team before the trade, AD were providing DPOY calibre defense while sharing the offensive load, iirc he was among the top MVP leader until they lose to Denvers. 

Also 27/8/8 is not better than what Shai and Jokic is providing lol, not close. I will happily take 34.6 ppg on great efficiency and great defense and triple double monster on all time great efficiency over whatever Lebron is doing right now every days of the week || I love bron, but he’s just not deserving this year, I do think he deserves first team though. || Just Insane, I guess just throw out the numbers & team records. 

Who cares how old LeBron is. MVP comes down to who had the best overall stats plus your team's record.

Jokic is averaging a Triple Double as a Center, Mind Blowing because he's not even trying to get them, it just happens in the flow of the game.

SGA is the leading scorer on the Best team in the Western Conference which is also the Best Defensive team in the league. 

MVP's aren't Lifetime achievement awards. This isn't the Oscars || It's not the ""most valuable player when corrected for age"" award.

I am firmly in the camp of thinking that LeBron should have more mvps than he does and I still think you're making a terrible argument. 

If it were actually an individual award based solely on this season Jokic would win easily. Since it's a media based narrative driven award that for some reason gives you a bonus for playing with better teammates (resulting in more team wins) and Jokic already has multiple mvps and voters are ""fatigued"" it's close and SGA might win.

The way the Lakers are playing LeBron still has a shot at finals mvp, but there's no reasonable argument for him to win mvp this year. || Lmfaoooo lakers are only winning now cause of Luka. LeBron off ball and less strain on him. He has no chance of winning over SGA or joker || Lebron is playing like a top 5 player right now. Not just for the last X weeks, but for the season. Which is astonishing, honestly. He is 4th in the league in VORP and PER as well as 7th in BPM. But he has no statistical argument for MVP with how insane Shai and Jokic have been. They are both a tier above the competition. 


I hope Bron gets 1st team honors, but it would be pretty insulting to give him MVP unless things change dramatically down the stretch.  || AD led the Lakers in Estimated Wins until 2 games ago lol.  Also take a drink every time OP says ""last 30 games"". 

*Warning: do not play the LeMVP Drinking Game while operating heavy machinery.* || I do not think that his age should have an impact on him getting an MVP, it is impressive what he is doing at that age but it shouldn't be a factor. || SGA is playing absolutely bananas right now, it's his to lose. His numbers are bananas, his team is #1, Chet has barely played, and JDub is not as good as he was last season. || Say, how exactly does Lebron have  better leadership and impact compared to Jokic? What did you use to measure it? || I agree. Also, LeBron doing this at 40 shouldn’t be a factor for MVP discussions, his age makes his performance more impressive for sure, but not more valuable

Edit: Just to clarify, I said *shouldn’t*, I understand that the MVP is a narrative award but it *shouldn’t* be || tatum is a convo, but i’d still pick tatum i think. doesn’t really sniff the others even though he is playing out of his mind || Tatum should not even be in the conversation. Zero consistency plus team under performing || lol he’s better than sga, if you’re saying you’d rather have sga for a playoff series than bron you’re out of your mind || I think the idea is more so ""If you average MVP-caliber box score stats and you do something groundbreaking, you automatically enter the MVP conversation,"" probably meaning Top 5-ish. || He started playing like this since AD’s been gone/out. But I agree, lebrons early season really killed his chances. || First Team at 40 years old would be one of the wildest things ever || Narrative is a big deal. But his numbers and even record isn’t good enough either way || In a perfect world, yeah. But narrative does play a part. If it didn't, there's no way Rose wins that 2011 MVP, unless the voters really just don't understand that the Bulls hung their hat on defense and Rose played the Iverson role, keeping a team of elite defenders afloat offensively. Same with Westbrook averaging a triple-double.

LeBron's longevity narrative isn't enough to get him the MVP this year, but the voting process isn't completely free of human emotion and bias. || Eh, they have made exceptions for accomplishing out of the ordinary things, Westbrook’s first triple double season was awarded specifically because that stat line hadn’t been seen as a recent example.

It is hardly ever given to the actual most valuable player.

That being said, I didn’t see how it should be given to anyone other than Jokic this year, he is top 3 in points, assists, rebounds, and steals, shooting at an insane fg% including 44% from 3, with an astronomical PER.

Shari is the only other person with a case. 

But again, I think mvp is more about narratives now so it wouldn’t be out of the question that Lebron doing what he is at 40 could win it. || Nobody besides the top 3 are “in the conversation” but he’s a solid 4th || That's like not the criteria for MVP at all dude || MVP isn’t “who would you want in a hypothetical playoff series that hasn’t happened” it’s about who played the best in the 2024-2025 season || Nah I take Shai over him. The recent seasons has shown Lebron is not the ""if I have to take one player for a playoffs series"" Lebron anymore. He missed the playoffs, cant do anything stop Denvers even when AD playing like the best player in the world and got gentle swept back to back. He is nowhere the Final appearance monster he used to be whereas Shai is entering his prime, providing better scoring and way better defense. || That's still a stupid argument.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.03,0.82,0.151,0.9963,0.102,0.685,0.213,0.9996

It's also in the golden era of another highly valued tactic used by players... Foul grifting.

**Full Disclosure:**

*Before I discuss this topic further, I want to be fully transparent: I used to teach players how to grift, and I’m not ashamed of it one bit.*

*The NBA is one of the most competitive environments in the world, and you win in this league on the margins. All players must abide by the same rules, but the more creatively a player can interpret those rules and push them to their limit, the more they will find an edge against their competition.*

*Necessity is the mother of innovation.*

**Au Revoir Paris:**

The discourse surrounding the 24/25 NBA season has included much discussion of how long games *actually* take and multiple takes on wanting the NBA to be more like FIBA.

Mainly because the 2024 Olympic Tournament in Paris delivered a compelling, competitive, and beautiful *basketball* product.

It gave fans a snapshot of what the best players in the world looked like when they were forced to *play* basketball instead of putting together audition tapes for Wipe Out.

FIBA referees showed the world that they do the one thing NBA officials refuse to do:

They do not acquiesce to foul-grifting from the top players.

Players in the NBA will always seek competitive advantages wherever they can; that’s the nature of the beast. The NBA needs a deterrent, something to level the playing field. One rule change will improve the aesthetics and length of games while bringing back ethical hoops, which viewers are clamoring for.

*The Rule:*

*“Grifting Plenty”*

*Any obvious foul-grifting action will result in a foul on the grifting player. Then, the opposing team will be awarded one free throw and the ball.*

This rule is not mild; it’s spicy. But drastic times call for drastic measures.

*(You might be saying this is such a subjective rule; it is, so is almost every other rule in basketball.)*

**Cash Rules Everything:**

During All-Star weekend, the consensus was that the players make so much money that the league will never get them to care about a game in which each player on the winning team receives *only* $125,000.

The risk of an All-Star player getting hurt during the game isn’t as significant as the reward for winning. Everything in basketball is a risk vs. reward calculation, whether it’s playing hard in the All-Star game or attempting to foul grift.

The fine for flopping is $2,000, and it’s not even enforced. The fines for flopping during the 23/24 season totaled $52,000 for the entire league! 

The total for the 24/25 season is a whopping $6,000. 

Last week, when talking to folks around the league about the issue of foul-grifting, one Eastern Conference Executive mentioned that the $2,000 flopping fine is nothing to these guys; it’s a Wednesday bottle of Cab (Cabernet Sauvignon).

Fines and warnings at these levels aren’t cutting it, not in the slightest; this is a competition issue.

A properly executed Foul Grift results in free throws, the highest PPP action in basketball, and fouls on the other team’s best defenders. The payoff for the gifting player is way too big for a silly warning or empty threat of a $2,000 fine to interfere with their grifting mission.

Newton’s third law of physics states, “for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.” It’s time for the league to establish an equal and opposite response to the foul-grifting epidemic because, at this moment, the pendulum has swung too far in favor of the grifters.

**Splitting The Baby:**

Over the past week, I’ve watched way too many of the best players in the world being fouled repeatedly. I estimate that I’ve seen about 2,000 fouls committed.

I’ve come away with two conclusions:

1. The best players in the world are creating more advantages than other players. They are the best because they combine size, athleticism, and skill in a way few others can—not because they’re the best at drawing free throws.
2. The best players do not need the extra help of giving them foul calls when they have not created advantages and do not attempt to make basketball plays.

The NBA and its officials' most significant problem is that they’re trying to split the baby. They refuse to take a genuine stand on foul grifting. Instead, they’re choosing the route of half measures.

When officiating these grifting actions, they are fouls for some players but not others. They are shooting fouls sometimes and side-out other times. They are play-on situations for some and fouls other times.

One of these grifting actions could happen precisely the same way four games in a row and be called differently each time. Either these players are interpreting the rules correctly, pushing them to the absolute limits, and creating advantages on the margins, or they’re making non-basketball plays, and the structure needs to be reinforced.

NBA players are some of the world's most creative and competitive people. If you give them a structure to play in by using well-defined rules, they will find a way to push the limits and create a competitive advantage. If you change the structure by changing the rules to something different, they’ll do the same thing again. Players will adjust.

The league has to pick a side and stop trying to split the baby.

The torpedo is another non-shooting foul that is only called because the player makes an unnatural shooting motion.

The torpedo is precisely what it sounds like. It’s when a player launches into the defender and throws their arms up as if that’s how they shoot a shot[5](#footnote-5). The offensive player will almost always put themselves off balance, out of rhythm, and totally out of control, all for the chance at *earning* a trip to the free-throw line.

Few players have the type of heat-seeking precision as Joel Embiid and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Some torpedo actions will be called shooting fouls, some non-shooting fouls; no one knows which will be the case.

If Adam Silver and the league office are looking for more of that FIBA/Olympic magic, look no further than foul-grifting. They must set the standard and determine what will and will not be tolerated.

Seeing the players *play* the game and find solutions to a defensive problem is one of the best parts of basketball. Still, too often now, the best players see the most efficient solution as throwing their body into a defender or simply falling. If you can trick an official, the payoff is massive, and there are zero real consequences. After all, it’s easier to make a shot from 15 feet away with no one guarding you than anything else.

Between the grifting and reviews, the game has become a constant stop-and-start debate about the rule book.

Consumers and employees both throw their hands up due to the lack of consistency.

One of the classic flavors of grifting is *The Fall*; it’s not a complicated move, but it takes years of dedication to the craft of grifting to pull it off.

Players will fall when given the opportunity. This sounds pretty wild, but it highlights one of the keys to being a good foul grifter in the NBA: You have to be willing to make things so uncomfortable and awkward for everyone that it forces officials to blow the whistle to bring the situation back into the social norm.

By blowing the whistle for a foul, the officials are telling the 15,000 people in the stands, “Hey guys, don’t worry, this 7-foot, 290-pound adult didn’t just fall out of nowhere; there was a very violent action committed against them; you just couldn’t see it.”

If the NBA wants fans to fall back in love with the product, it must create a structure through the rules to eliminate the competitive advantage of foul-grifting. A genuine deterrent is required to shift the status quo and make ethical hoops not the exception but the norm.

But maybe that’s not what they want; I could be completely off here. Perhaps they want what is happening right now, the engagement. I’m more of a purest who believes the game deserves more, but at the end of the day, maybe it’s all just Baby Faces and Heel turns.",144,56,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j859il/the_one_rule_to_save_the_nba/,2025-03-10 14:13:38,"The flow of basketball is what attracted me to it 40 years ago. The flow is still there, but as the game tightens up, the grift increases, and the flow decreases. 

I don’t think a monetary penalty is the answer. I think the punishment in real game terms is. 

I think the FIBA rule is the key, but I also loathe giving the refs (SOME of the refs) another opportunity to control the game.

So along with any rule change, I think we desperately need to increase ref accountability. Otherwise we’re going to have endless debates around how refs are changing outcomes. || This isn’t too far from the flopping rule the league tried a few years ago and then just silently stopped calling. Just harsher penalties. 


Since they didn’t stick with the version of this with less penalty, I don’t see them over-correcting opposed to just not calling the foul and then that foul-baiter just wasted a possession. Naturally, they’ll stop doing it without stoppage in play and more whistles in a game intended to have more fluidity. 


Already seen success with the rip through not counting as a shooting foul. No need to penalize when you can just stop rewarding. || Well. The only problem I see here is, that we're trying to fix what isn't necessarily broken. FTA for the past few years is low. Lowest than any other period in league history. 

People perceive it as a problem, because the most common way of commenting on the NBA is complaining. And this is a real problem.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || I don’t think you need to punish grifting. Just don’t reward it.  I have t seen many flop calls this year but seen plenty of flops. I’d just be happy with a simple rule change. If the offense purposely bumps into the defense. No foul. || This is one of the reasons curry is so damn popular and fun to watch. He rarely grifts. Same goes for Jokic. And I know many will disagree, but LeBron also doesn't foul grift, he just embellishes contact when there is some. The most fun to watch players don't foul grift. || You'd have to stop and review the stupid flop if there's a free throw for the other team. I like where your head's at but you've just got to make the fines incredibly harsh: $100k fines and you're suspended for two games for the first 5 flops, second 5 flops you get 5 games/$250k, and if you rack up 5 more you're ineligible for individual awards and the first round of the playoffs. || [NBA individual seasons ranked by FTA](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fta_season.html)

James Harden has a few seasons in the top 50, Westbrook has one, KD has one. Everyone else in the top 50 is retired || Paris showed us how great the game is with the international rules for timeouts at the end of the game. Watching them just ball out that last two minutes was the best difference. Fouls didn’t register. || I like trying to get rid of grifting but what do you do when Dame curls off a screen pulls up to shoot and the defender's arm is curled around his arm? That's a foul but everyone considers it grifting.

He used to get continuation and free throws but the refs have stopped giving that. But now you want to call a foul on him for curling off a screen and shooting... || The answer to this problem is simple, but goes against the league’s officiating philosophy. The answer is the referees should just… not call these as as fouls, totally based on their judgment that it is foul seeking behavior. Stare at it and don’t blow the whistle.

The NBA has a legalistic philosophy that officiating can be totally enumerated by specific hard rules and there should be no subjectivity. Hence it is fundamentally exploitable. There will always be loopholes and the league lets you exploit them.

But in FIBA the refs are just like “Nah. I’m in charge of this game and I’m not going to call that nonsense as a foul and you’re making yourself look like an idiot because now it’s a turnover”

The NBA needs that.

If the league just tells officials - don’t call fouls on plays where the offensive player is looking for it; and you can make that judgment as you see fit. Foul grifting would go away and the game would be better to watch. 

And yes people would be mad about officiating being too subjective. That’s the trade off. Basically what the premier league does. Improve watchability at the expense of increased subjectivity. || A lot of foul grifting can't be caught during the flow of a game and stopping to review those calls would be terrible. But that shouldn't stop a post-game review. I'd be in favor of awarding technicals after the game for any foul grifting. That wouldn't help teams during the game but technicals could quickly add up, leading to suspensions and fines that might actually deter players. || This whole obsession with “foul grifting” and “ethical basketball” is so fucking stupid. The rules need to change for sure but this is not going to “save the nba”. Players have been “foul grifting” forever, make the games more accessible to watch, hire some actual analysts who take the game seriously, increase physicality, reduce the amount of games in the season.

There’s no “one fix”, there is a lot wrong with the nba at the moment || I feel like if the NBA reduced the personal foul limit from 6 to 3-4, refs would naturally start calling fewer fouls to avoid fouling people out. They'd have to be choosier about the fouls they call and would stop calling tick tack fouls. 

Maybe pilot the program as a regular-season only thing first and see how it goes. Since in the postseason they're allowed to play more physically anyway, and the consequences of a star player fouling out in a 7 game series are massive. || The problem with your rule's logic is this: 

>Any obvious foul-grifting action will result in a foul on the grifting player. Then, the opposing team will be *awarded one free throw* and the ball.

The problem with only giving the opposing team one free throw is that the risk-reward status still benefits the grifting player/team to grift. If you get two free throws for a successful grift, but only one free throw and the ball (which is out of bounds and makes it more likely to steal it) for being caught grifting, then the team still gains something by grifting in ""you only give up one point instead of two or possibly three/four.""

The only way an anti-grifting rule will really have legs is if the amount of free throws the opposing team gets is equal to the amount of free throws the grifting team would have gotten if the foul was called. If the foul for grifting is now two FT's and the ball, now you have a real punishment for the team instead of ""a foul for your good defender that's part of the game, you take a point or two away from the opposing team they should have gotten, and you have a better chance at stealing."" || How about banning habitual foul grifters from being in MVP and all-NBA conversations?

Then maybe Embiid and Shai would spend less time launching their bodies into opponents when taking a shot || Something I think about all the time is how players are coached young to look for contact when they drive to the rim. I always saw that as a direct pipeline to foul grifting and baiting. I also want to point out the difference between flopping and baiting as I think it’s another reason this problem isn’t the easiest to solve with one rule. 

Flopping is pretending to be fouled or exaggerating when you are fouled to get the call. Soft fouls are real but certain larger stronger players don’t get the calls. This leads to flopping. James harden for all his baiting was the first I would see cock is head back to get the whistle for slaps to his arms that of course were harder to see. 

Baiting is when you purposefully try to get the defender to foul you almost foregoing the basket. Sticking with harden this was what I think people hated the most. And we have seen the league do things to get around this right? Like the arm tie up and throwing the ball up to nowhere basically then getting 3 free throws. That obviously sucked and I think we don’t see it anymore. Or at least I haven’t seen it. 

All this to say I think as others have said the foul problem with the league is overstated. I think the biggest thing hurting viewership is the inability for people to watch the games, the games being constantly late. And the way the nba seems invested in shitting on its product.

However to specifically address your rule suggestion I just think these guys are too good. The foul baiting and grifting will continue unless technology changes because no matter what there will be missed calls. Like the shove against Luka a few nights ago etc. that will make these guys think they have to do this, it’s their right to do this to win games. Like I feel like one missed call begets 20 flops.

I just feel like the nba would never do this. || > Any obvious foul-grifting action will result in a foul on the grifting player. Then, the opposing team will be awarded one free throw and the ball.

All they have to do is *stop calling them on the defender*. No need to call it on the offensive player (unless it's an offensive foul for other reasons).

As long as these same refs have a mindset that these ""grifts"" are somehow defensive fouls, telling them that grifting is an offensive foul won't help - because obviously the refs see them as legitimate fouls and not grifts in the first place! || Let Nico Harrison make trades for all the teams, just for pure entertainment.  Although it's likely the Lakers end up with SGA, Giannis and Jokic. || [removed] || It seems like the OP has a lot of intelligently reasoned posts, but I agree its not clear that foul baiting is really a major problem in the NBA beyond a few highly vocal SGA haters (and notice he's more than 1 FTA per game behind Giannis).  The last time someone led the league with fewer FTA per game was Harden in 2017-2018. || Yeah but take into consideration how much the league changed in relation to shooting. We are historically shooting the most 3s which gives less chances to be fouled and foul baiting while driving is even more noticeable because of it. There are extended periods of time in todays NBA, where a player either shoots or drives and looks for contact. On drives is easily awarded with FTs (ofc this depends on officiating which op rightfully deems as another problem which is consistency of whistles). For a fan it can quickly become boring. || I do not understand how people think FTA is a good argument. Defenders are having to change the way they are defending because of the foul-grifting behavior of offensive players. || FTA is low because no one is driving to the hoop and trying to yam it. || Can you state the one rule to save the NBA in one sentence? || Even if it's not called a few times, it doesn't stop the players from trying because the reward of getting one is too great and there is no downside to being caught. || I've gotta disagree. The players are the ones who need to own their bullshit and stop it, but if they won't, there needs to be a harsh penalty. For example: 

* 2 shots against and loss of possession. 
* Technical foul every time. Standard 2 techs and you're done for the day. 
* Fine first time, then suspension for every occasion after that, increasing with what occasion it is.

It's also in the golden era of another highly valued tactic used by players... Foul grifting.

**Full Disclosure:**

*Before I discuss this topic further, I want to be fully transparent: I used to teach players how to grift, and I’m not ashamed of it one bit.*

*The NBA is one of the most competitive environments in the world, and you win in this league on the margins. All players must abide by the same rules, but the more creatively a player can interpret those rules and push them to their limit, the more they will find an edge against their competition.*

*Necessity is the mother of innovation.*

**Au Revoir Paris:**

The discourse surrounding the 24/25 NBA season has included much discussion of how long games *actually* take and multiple takes on wanting the NBA to be more like FIBA.

Mainly because the 2024 Olympic Tournament in Paris delivered a compelling, competitive, and beautiful *basketball* product.

It gave fans a snapshot of what the best players in the world looked like when they were forced to *play* basketball instead of putting together audition tapes for Wipe Out.

FIBA referees showed the world that they do the one thing NBA officials refuse to do:

They do not acquiesce to foul-grifting from the top players.

Players in the NBA will always seek competitive advantages wherever they can; that’s the nature of the beast. The NBA needs a deterrent, something to level the playing field. One rule change will improve the aesthetics and length of games while bringing back ethical hoops, which viewers are clamoring for.

*The Rule:*

*“Grifting Plenty”*

*Any obvious foul-grifting action will result in a foul on the grifting player. Then, the opposing team will be awarded one free throw and the ball.*

This rule is not mild; it’s spicy. But drastic times call for drastic measures.

*(You might be saying this is such a subjective rule; it is, so is almost every other rule in basketball.)*

**Cash Rules Everything:**

During All-Star weekend, the consensus was that the players make so much money that the league will never get them to care about a game in which each player on the winning team receives *only* $125,000.

The risk of an All-Star player getting hurt during the game isn’t as significant as the reward for winning. Everything in basketball is a risk vs. reward calculation, whether it’s playing hard in the All-Star game or attempting to foul grift.

The fine for flopping is $2,000, and it’s not even enforced. The fines for flopping during the 23/24 season totaled $52,000 for the entire league! 

The total for the 24/25 season is a whopping $6,000. 

Last week, when talking to folks around the league about the issue of foul-grifting, one Eastern Conference Executive mentioned that the $2,000 flopping fine is nothing to these guys; it’s a Wednesday bottle of Cab (Cabernet Sauvignon).

Fines and warnings at these levels aren’t cutting it, not in the slightest; this is a competition issue.

A properly executed Foul Grift results in free throws, the highest PPP action in basketball, and fouls on the other team’s best defenders. The payoff for the gifting player is way too big for a silly warning or empty threat of a $2,000 fine to interfere with their grifting mission.

Newton’s third law of physics states, “for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.” It’s time for the league to establish an equal and opposite response to the foul-grifting epidemic because, at this moment, the pendulum has swung too far in favor of the grifters.

**Splitting The Baby:**

Over the past week, I’ve watched way too many of the best players in the world being fouled repeatedly. I estimate that I’ve seen about 2,000 fouls committed.

I’ve come away with two conclusions:

1. The best players in the world are creating more advantages than other players. They are the best because they combine size, athleticism, and skill in a way few others can—not because they’re the best at drawing free throws.
2. The best players do not need the extra help of giving them foul calls when they have not created advantages and do not attempt to make basketball plays.

The NBA and its officials' most significant problem is that they’re trying to split the baby. They refuse to take a genuine stand on foul grifting. Instead, they’re choosing the route of half measures.

When officiating these grifting actions, they are fouls for some players but not others. They are shooting fouls sometimes and side-out other times. They are play-on situations for some and fouls other times.

One of these grifting actions could happen precisely the same way four games in a row and be called differently each time. Either these players are interpreting the rules correctly, pushing them to the absolute limits, and creating advantages on the margins, or they’re making non-basketball plays, and the structure needs to be reinforced.

NBA players are some of the world's most creative and competitive people. If you give them a structure to play in by using well-defined rules, they will find a way to push the limits and create a competitive advantage. If you change the structure by changing the rules to something different, they’ll do the same thing again. Players will adjust.

The league has to pick a side and stop trying to split the baby.

The torpedo is another non-shooting foul that is only called because the player makes an unnatural shooting motion.

The torpedo is precisely what it sounds like. It’s when a player launches into the defender and throws their arms up as if that’s how they shoot a shot[5](#footnote-5). The offensive player will almost always put themselves off balance, out of rhythm, and totally out of control, all for the chance at *earning* a trip to the free-throw line.

Few players have the type of heat-seeking precision as Joel Embiid and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Some torpedo actions will be called shooting fouls, some non-shooting fouls; no one knows which will be the case.

If Adam Silver and the league office are looking for more of that FIBA/Olympic magic, look no further than foul-grifting. They must set the standard and determine what will and will not be tolerated.

Seeing the players *play* the game and find solutions to a defensive problem is one of the best parts of basketball. Still, too often now, the best players see the most efficient solution as throwing their body into a defender or simply falling. If you can trick an official, the payoff is massive, and there are zero real consequences. After all, it’s easier to make a shot from 15 feet away with no one guarding you than anything else.

Between the grifting and reviews, the game has become a constant stop-and-start debate about the rule book.

Consumers and employees both throw their hands up due to the lack of consistency.

One of the classic flavors of grifting is *The Fall*; it’s not a complicated move, but it takes years of dedication to the craft of grifting to pull it off.

Players will fall when given the opportunity. This sounds pretty wild, but it highlights one of the keys to being a good foul grifter in the NBA: You have to be willing to make things so uncomfortable and awkward for everyone that it forces officials to blow the whistle to bring the situation back into the social norm.

By blowing the whistle for a foul, the officials are telling the 15,000 people in the stands, “Hey guys, don’t worry, this 7-foot, 290-pound adult didn’t just fall out of nowhere; there was a very violent action committed against them; you just couldn’t see it.”

If the NBA wants fans to fall back in love with the product, it must create a structure through the rules to eliminate the competitive advantage of foul-grifting. A genuine deterrent is required to shift the status quo and make ethical hoops not the exception but the norm.

But maybe that’s not what they want; I could be completely off here. Perhaps they want what is happening right now, the engagement. I’m more of a purest who believes the game deserves more, but at the end of the day, maybe it’s all just Baby Faces and Heel turns.",149,56,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j859il/the_one_rule_to_save_the_nba/,2025-03-10 14:13:38,"The flow of basketball is what attracted me to it 40 years ago. The flow is still there, but as the game tightens up, the grift increases, and the flow decreases. 

I don’t think a monetary penalty is the answer. I think the punishment in real game terms is. 

I think the FIBA rule is the key, but I also loathe giving the refs (SOME of the refs) another opportunity to control the game.

So along with any rule change, I think we desperately need to increase ref accountability. Otherwise we’re going to have endless debates around how refs are changing outcomes. || This isn’t too far from the flopping rule the league tried a few years ago and then just silently stopped calling. Just harsher penalties. 


Since they didn’t stick with the version of this with less penalty, I don’t see them over-correcting opposed to just not calling the foul and then that foul-baiter just wasted a possession. Naturally, they’ll stop doing it without stoppage in play and more whistles in a game intended to have more fluidity. 


Already seen success with the rip through not counting as a shooting foul. No need to penalize when you can just stop rewarding. || Well. The only problem I see here is, that we're trying to fix what isn't necessarily broken. FTA for the past few years is low. Lowest than any other period in league history. 

People perceive it as a problem, because the most common way of commenting on the NBA is complaining. And this is a real problem.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || I don’t think you need to punish grifting. Just don’t reward it.  I have t seen many flop calls this year but seen plenty of flops. I’d just be happy with a simple rule change. If the offense purposely bumps into the defense. No foul. || This is one of the reasons curry is so damn popular and fun to watch. He rarely grifts. Same goes for Jokic. And I know many will disagree, but LeBron also doesn't foul grift, he just embellishes contact when there is some. The most fun to watch players don't foul grift. || You'd have to stop and review the stupid flop if there's a free throw for the other team. I like where your head's at but you've just got to make the fines incredibly harsh: $100k fines and you're suspended for two games for the first 5 flops, second 5 flops you get 5 games/$250k, and if you rack up 5 more you're ineligible for individual awards and the first round of the playoffs. || [NBA individual seasons ranked by FTA](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fta_season.html)

James Harden has a few seasons in the top 50, Westbrook has one, KD has one. Everyone else in the top 50 is retired || Paris showed us how great the game is with the international rules for timeouts at the end of the game. Watching them just ball out that last two minutes was the best difference. Fouls didn’t register. || I like trying to get rid of grifting but what do you do when Dame curls off a screen pulls up to shoot and the defender's arm is curled around his arm? That's a foul but everyone considers it grifting.

He used to get continuation and free throws but the refs have stopped giving that. But now you want to call a foul on him for curling off a screen and shooting... || The answer to this problem is simple, but goes against the league’s officiating philosophy. The answer is the referees should just… not call these as as fouls, totally based on their judgment that it is foul seeking behavior. Stare at it and don’t blow the whistle.

The NBA has a legalistic philosophy that officiating can be totally enumerated by specific hard rules and there should be no subjectivity. Hence it is fundamentally exploitable. There will always be loopholes and the league lets you exploit them.

But in FIBA the refs are just like “Nah. I’m in charge of this game and I’m not going to call that nonsense as a foul and you’re making yourself look like an idiot because now it’s a turnover”

The NBA needs that.

If the league just tells officials - don’t call fouls on plays where the offensive player is looking for it; and you can make that judgment as you see fit. Foul grifting would go away and the game would be better to watch. 

And yes people would be mad about officiating being too subjective. That’s the trade off. Basically what the premier league does. Improve watchability at the expense of increased subjectivity. || A lot of foul grifting can't be caught during the flow of a game and stopping to review those calls would be terrible. But that shouldn't stop a post-game review. I'd be in favor of awarding technicals after the game for any foul grifting. That wouldn't help teams during the game but technicals could quickly add up, leading to suspensions and fines that might actually deter players. || This whole obsession with “foul grifting” and “ethical basketball” is so fucking stupid. The rules need to change for sure but this is not going to “save the nba”. Players have been “foul grifting” forever, make the games more accessible to watch, hire some actual analysts who take the game seriously, increase physicality, reduce the amount of games in the season.

There’s no “one fix”, there is a lot wrong with the nba at the moment || I feel like if the NBA reduced the personal foul limit from 6 to 3-4, refs would naturally start calling fewer fouls to avoid fouling people out. They'd have to be choosier about the fouls they call and would stop calling tick tack fouls. 

Maybe pilot the program as a regular-season only thing first and see how it goes. Since in the postseason they're allowed to play more physically anyway, and the consequences of a star player fouling out in a 7 game series are massive. || The problem with your rule's logic is this: 

>Any obvious foul-grifting action will result in a foul on the grifting player. Then, the opposing team will be *awarded one free throw* and the ball.

The problem with only giving the opposing team one free throw is that the risk-reward status still benefits the grifting player/team to grift. If you get two free throws for a successful grift, but only one free throw and the ball (which is out of bounds and makes it more likely to steal it) for being caught grifting, then the team still gains something by grifting in ""you only give up one point instead of two or possibly three/four.""

The only way an anti-grifting rule will really have legs is if the amount of free throws the opposing team gets is equal to the amount of free throws the grifting team would have gotten if the foul was called. If the foul for grifting is now two FT's and the ball, now you have a real punishment for the team instead of ""a foul for your good defender that's part of the game, you take a point or two away from the opposing team they should have gotten, and you have a better chance at stealing."" || How about banning habitual foul grifters from being in MVP and all-NBA conversations?

Then maybe Embiid and Shai would spend less time launching their bodies into opponents when taking a shot || Something I think about all the time is how players are coached young to look for contact when they drive to the rim. I always saw that as a direct pipeline to foul grifting and baiting. I also want to point out the difference between flopping and baiting as I think it’s another reason this problem isn’t the easiest to solve with one rule. 

Flopping is pretending to be fouled or exaggerating when you are fouled to get the call. Soft fouls are real but certain larger stronger players don’t get the calls. This leads to flopping. James harden for all his baiting was the first I would see cock is head back to get the whistle for slaps to his arms that of course were harder to see. 

Baiting is when you purposefully try to get the defender to foul you almost foregoing the basket. Sticking with harden this was what I think people hated the most. And we have seen the league do things to get around this right? Like the arm tie up and throwing the ball up to nowhere basically then getting 3 free throws. That obviously sucked and I think we don’t see it anymore. Or at least I haven’t seen it. 

All this to say I think as others have said the foul problem with the league is overstated. I think the biggest thing hurting viewership is the inability for people to watch the games, the games being constantly late. And the way the nba seems invested in shitting on its product.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"""Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""Shai"" OR ""Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""The Shai""",2025-03-12,nbadiscussion,1ja2kjb,"The ""Free Throw Merchant"" argument is tired","For starters I am not an OKC or SGA fan. I think he's a very polished player and love seeing him progress into a superstar and the current best scorer in the league by the numbers. The unfortunate issue that comes with this title is the historical media investigation into *how* a player scores so many points in a game, and for the modern NBA, the topic of free throws always comes into question. Shai is the latest victim of this idea, that because he's getting a lot of free throws, he's somehow less capable of a scorer.

Not only is this a casual outlook on Basketball in general, but historical records from beloved pure scorers show that Shai isn't that much of a ""free throw merchant"" at all, and that he should be drawing even more.

Shai is currently averaging 32.7 PPG with 8.9 FTA/g on 8.0 FTM/g. You can comment on his visual playstyle and how he baits fouls in games constantly, but these numbers tell us that compared to other scoring champions, he's either bad at baiting or it's being blown out of proportion

Since 1990, the average stats for an NBA scoring champion are 30.1 PPG with 9.3 FTA/g on 8.0 FTM/g.

This means Shai gets to the line as often as the average scoring champ and relies on free throws slightly less than average. Over the last 35 years, 14 scoring champs averaged more FTM/g than SGA over the season.

Compare Shai's whistle with that of seasons from Kobe, KD, Harden, Embiid, AI. These are cream of the crop modern scorers in analysts eyes, each of them had seasons with 9+ FTM/g as scoring champions of the league.

It should be no surprise to anyone that players who shoot the ball a lot get lot's of shooting fouls. People tend to view this as a negative to the player drawing them vs the defense that cannot prevent them from scoring without illegal contact. Harden mastered the arm hook and step-back kickout, Embiid's pump fake fouled defenders out constantly. Good scorers understand the defense is always at a disadvantage against them, great scorers understand how to take advantage of that.

The facts are that Shai is having a statistically average MVP caliber scoring champion season, and the discourse of his foul baiting and never ending trips to the line are the result of cherrypicked box scores and video clips, and even if it weren't, it's indicative that Shai and any other great scorer are simply unstoppable with good ol' fundamental defense",0,17,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ja2kjb/the_free_throw_merchant_argument_is_tired/,2025-03-12 23:08:09,"i don't really mind how many free throws shai gets and honestly i like shai as a player. but sometimes the way he gets those calls feels a little scummy. no hate to him though. small guards be doing that sometimes. || I am an OKC fan but I believe that the reason people are so annoyed with SGA selling contact and “foul baiting” (I think every great scorer has their own way of selling contact to get to the line) is because he doesn’t need to. If SGA averaged 6 fts instead of 8 or 9 he would still average 30. He leads the league in points and is like 2nd or something if you took away his free throws. Nobody in their right mind thinks SGA isnt a great scorer their problem is with the fact he doesn’t need to do the theatrics to still get his points. || OKC fans don’t understand SGA is incredibly gifted and not a fun player to watch, namely because he foul baits || How are you going to compare him to Embiid and Harden then act like people have no grounds for calling him the next free throw merchant? Bitch, you just compared him to the most foul baiting free throw merchants this game ever knew.

You ever think it’s quality of his foul baiting, not the quantity? Even Ant Edwards tired of his foul baiting ass || I just think the entire free throw merchant thing is a Reddit thing that I don’t hear anyone IRL talking about.   

NBA fans seem to do more to try to downgrade superstar caliber players more than any other sport.   It’s like they look for reasons to not like a player just to prop up the player they root for.   

If a dude is flopping, the refs should call it.    I see it the same as holding in football.   If a player is holding, the refs should call it.   I just can’t sit around complaining because a guy gets to the fouls line all the time. || You lost me in the first paragraph. Do you watch him play? He is the definition of a free throw merchant. || 14 scoring champs averaged more FTM/g than him so he’s 15 of 35? That doesn’t seem to help the argument. 

Also I could be wrong but if FTM is free throws made then that isn’t a good stat to base this argument on. Should be pure FT/g || A lot of people don’t watch games. They watch clips on social and check box scores. || Quality v Quantity doesn't make sense. Jalen Brunson and Trae Young throw themselves at their opponent way worse than Shai and don't get nearly as much attention for it. CP3 made a career of it. Quantity gives them the foul merchant title in the media, and Shai doesn't deserve that regard when compared with others, for now at least. And if you actually read the post, I'm saying he gets *significantly* less free throws than Harden and Embiid yet is being placed on the same level. I'm comparing to disprove the comparison lmao. Shai's current numbers are more comparable to that of Westbrook, LeBron and MJ, who average between 6-7.5 FTM/g in their highest FT seasons than Harden and Embiid, who sit between 9.5-11 FTM/g for it. || y'all are beyond repair. You better have had this same energy with Kobe's pump fakes and KD's rip through. || 40% of the modern scoring champ winners made more free throws than him per game in their respective seasons. Do you think 40% of those scoring champ seasons can be **primarily** attributed to shooting foul baiting to the point of being called an FT merchant? 11 of those seasons came from 5 guys, however KD, Kobe and AI are rarely ever picked apart for foul baiting. Is SGA really a bigger FT merchant than KD, AI or Kobe?

I used FTM because it better contrasts his natural scoring ability against his reliance on free throws. FTA can be influenced by really inefficient shooters (shaq for instance attempted 10.4 but made 5.1, so his high FTA count could imply he foul baits but the FTM shows Shaq isn't purposely going to the free throw line lmao). || Yours is the second post on the same day in this sub that pretends free throws magically appear from nowhere. Free throw attempts come from field goal attempts, mostly 2pters (unless you're Harden) and specifically shots at the rim. You need to look at free throw rate and % of points from free throws.

SGA burst onto the scene as an elite player two years ago, when he made 9.8 free throws per game. Only Harden (10.2) and Embiid (10.0) have had more since 1990. That's where he got his reputation, which is hard to shake, even if he's refined his game somewhat since. || Comparing kd to sga is hilarious || The point is that all these players had signature foul baiting moves and are beloved as ethical scorers vs. SGA who gets hate for the same thing. Btw, SGA is peaking as the 4th best scorer ever behind only MJ, Bron, and KD btw.

What makes Shai a foul merchant? Is it the amount of times he does it?   If that's the case then how can we objectively measure that?

Is it just because of losing recency biasness?  Y'know everytime when your team loses, it feels like the refs are helping the other side more and vice versa.

Even the definition of foul merchant is filmsy; you can't call something a foul merchant if you can't define what it is.

1.  If a player pumps fakes and another play bites, is that bad defense or foul baiting? 

2.  If a player pushes off the defense and the refs fail to call it, is that bad reffing or foul baiting?

We run into two problems calling Shai a foul merchant.  

First we can't define what it is.  If we can't define what it is, then by definition we don't know what we are talking about.

Second every star player does what he does and every player is allowed to do what he is doing, so why is this a specific SGA problem and not a league problem?

It’s just as much a tool to draw the foul as a pump fake but I just don’t like the look of it. || It's pretty easy. What people criticize (I'm speaking generally) is hunting for fouls. 

The scorers that people don't complain about are the ones that are literally trying to make every shot legitimately.

There are some players that seem wired to exploit every loophole in reffing as opposed to just playing basketball.

Put simply: it's the BS moves that you would never do when playing pickup that are being called out.

(Important to note: my comment is player/era agnostic.) || No. Curry is a perfect example of this. Also pre like 2010, you couldn’t really flop like you can now. || It's the way he gets his fouls. He purposely jumps into his defender instead of just taking an easy layup or jumper || IMO: Being an avid Bulls fan of the 80s and 90s, here in Chicago, MJ got much the same hate from fans of every other NBA team that had title aspirations.   

Shai, much like MJ, also a guard too, got most of his points by driving to the basket.   

While perhaps overly simplistic, a fair comparison might be what percentage of a players scoring drives, which results in FTA.   Not Free Throws made.   No one complains about Giannis getting to the line 10.4 times per game, compared to 8.9 times per game for SGA.   Only because Giannis can't make his free throws.

Among other things, it shouldn't be Shai's fault that he is a great foul shooter.    It's called making them pay.

When those other fans complained about MJ going too much to the charity stripe, what happened exactly?   The Bulls won 6 NBA championships because, ultimately, it was up to their teams coaching staff to make sure they didn't foul MJ.   Obviously, they never figured it out.   

Fans of the Knicks always hated us, the Bulls, because they ain't us! || He drives a ton and draws a ton of contact - he gets the second most FTAs per game in the entire league. That's why people call him that. 

That being said - it's a completely valid strategy. While I don't like watching people intentionally want to get fouled, it's on the other team to adjust. 

Every great scorer isn't a foul merchant - Shai isn't even the biggest foul merchant among active players when Harden and Embiid are still around. 

Certain guys play for the foul and I don't like it but I recognize they're allowed to do it. I wish there were less fouls called period because I enjoy watching the game without as many stoppages. || Going through the comments, it's clear the bias is immense here too. Everyone's mad because Shai isn't doing what he's doing for their team and that butt hurt goes deep i guess. 

But yes, basically every god tier shooter in history has had excellent foul drawing skills. Its also just kinda weirdly telling on yourselves. The fact that the game today has degraded to just 3s is part of the problem. ANY player that can make ~10 drives a game will pull significant FTA. Modern defenses are pretty terrible at effectively guarding drives and it's why bigs that can sit in the paint and consistently block shots are so valuable. If a defense can't handle Shai, or Harden, or Giannis making drives to the rim then that's the defenses fault. Shai wins games, get over it or get better. 

The fact that nearly every person complains about how the league is just a 3pt contest now should watch OKC games religiously. If you want a team that plays physical ball, makes drives, isn't afraid to get contact, isn't afraid to push and won't take a billion 3s from a mile away then OKC is likely your new fav team tbh. You just have to watch the games man, that's really it. 

I also suspect gambling entering the game has made this worse. People trying to get rich off basketball gambling apps have misplaced anger when Shai or Dort or Chet ruins their picks and don't know what to do with themselves. || It’s fake fouls. If you make an unnatural motion to dive into a defender in legal guarding position it’s not a foul by the book! However SGA does this constantly and draws the whistle consistently. It’s bullshit, and we need to train referees to be better or hire new ones that know how to do their job || Casuals have gotten so used to PnR and 3 point chucking that when a player actually drives to the basket more than almost anyone in the league, you know, the easiest way to draw a foul, he’s a foul merchant. He absolutely does some egregious foul baiting at times, but no more than any other superstar. Being able to draw fouls is a unique skill. SGA just has a deeper bag than most other players, so of course it’s going to be met with more criticism || do we really need a daily discussion about this?  Just f'ing stop already.  The difference is that SGA does several things that make the game awful to watch.  1 - Guy is guarding him 30 feet from the basket, and happens to have his hands above SGA's, who is looking for this bullshit to suddenly raise his hands with the ball, as if he was going to actually shoot from there, just to draw a foul.  It's a nonsensical abuse of the rules.  2 - he initiates 90% of the contact as he drives with the shoulder lean-in to the basket.  3 - he snaps his head back like Mike Tyson hit him with an uppercut and the slightest contact - obvious exaggeration of what took place, and quite frankly I don't think he's going to get those calls in the playoffs. || [removed] || For the most part yes. Every elite scorer gets fouled a lot, it's part of being a truly elite scorer. Now, how and why they are fouled is sometimes different. For example, Shaq would usually draw fouls simply because no one could stop him physically (now mind you some of those fouls should probably have been called offensive fouls). People like MJ, LeBron, Shai, Harden, Kobe, Luka, etc all engage(d) in some form of 'foul baiting'. It's just logical. Now, there are a couple exceptions to the rule of elite scorers taking many FTs, mainly players like Curry and... well really just Curry, but I feel like a majority of that discrepancy is simply from him taking such a large amount of threes, which historically don't generate many FT attempts. || SGA is a current player so his clips are posted more compared to the previous ones, so they make fun of it as it's the internet. Complainers usually don't really watch other players, or simply rely on their nostalgia as a cop out instead of presenting actual non-curated game clips of players not ""grifting"".

There's only a select few mega scorers in history who don't get a lot of touch fouls relative to their peers and style of play. || People will keep calling him a free throw merchant until he wins a ring - they love hating. 

Also, for those that are unable to understand the game of basketball. If you are attacking the basket & shooting the basketball at the rate that SGA does - odds are you will have more people foul you than people who shoot the basketball less. 

Plus, if you are SGA, who other players around the league consistently say is the toughest player to guard - that means they cannot stop him for those that struggle to understand basketball - he will probably get fouled more because he constantly puts defenders in bad positions. He does this better than probably anyone else in the league. 

Keep hating & miss out on the greatness that we are witnessing. || It seems to me like intention.  He seems to have intention to not score but make a move and get contact to shoot free throws. || It’s the real fouls that aren't called where you maul Shai and refs look the other way. If you reach to stop Shai from blowing by it is a foul in the book! However many times SGA goes entire games where the defense let's him get to his spots and so he doesn't draw fouls and still scores 30+ points.  Since he shoots over 50% from the field, he doesn't really need those free throws just don't play illegal defense.    Do you hate Giannis too? JA too? || I think a lot of fans are confusing foul baiting with GETTING CALLS. Every great scorer in the game GOT CALLS, and a lot of the time it almost looked league-mandated, when u look back at it. 

But if we’re being completely honest, there’s nothing Shai is doing out there that Jordan Poole ain’t trying to do…….its just Poole is NEVER GONNA GET THE CALL || I am not a thunder fan, and I've watched a handful of their games so this is just my biased opinion. Many players use various tricks to get to the line. The officiating process and rules need to be reviewed in order to provide a more standardized approach to how calls are made in game. I think the reason that so much attention is placed on Shai is because he is able to draw so many fouls, while his team plays such intense physical defense. Shai will go for a layup on one end, and shoot freethrows because the defender grazed his hand. Then, Lu Dort will play heavy contact defense on the other end, and the officials will not be as quick to make the same call. Just my biased opinion though.  || Yes almost every elite scorer is a ""foul merchant"". Players in the social media era just get far more hate for it because of the way negative spreads today. || Yeah pretty much. 

I’m a die hard thunder fan. But I’m not stupid. SGA is a merchant. But there’s a difference in being a baiter and merchant to me. SGA gets guys to bite. And then uses that to his advantage. Like the greats. 

He isnt out there relying and just flailing around. 

He’s a historic scorer. Who gets people to bite and uses that to his advantage as he should. That’s on the nba to fix not him. || In the past players had to over exaggerate their fouls to let the ref's see it because they're blind AF. Then the flopping started and it got out of hand, so the league implementing fouls for flopping. Players went back to playing normal basketball. But Shai... that dude still gets away with flopping. || I wouldn't call him a foul merchant per se, but he gets an elite whistle. The refs don't allow much body contact at all. Basically the rest of the league isn't allowed to play defense on him without a foul being called. || It's easy to define. Pump fakes don't count. It's when offensive players initiate contact with a defender working hard to move their feet to stay between the basketball and the player they are guarding. I don't have a problem with initiating contact. Just don't call a foul. They already have an advantage. Don't reward them twice and disrupt the flow of the game. Call it the Jimmy Butler rule if you are so defensive about SGA. || I would say it’s how he gets his fouls he takes his shot looking for the foul rather then looking for the basket || Jordan got one of the kindest whistles ever. Harden and Shau are foul merchants. There is a difference || No. You may not be able to define what it is but it’s pretty darn easy. You are lying to us and yourself if you can’t see the difference between a scorer getting fouled and BS unnatural flailing which nobody would ever do except to bait refs into making an unwarranted call aka bailout || The hooking and flailing get me. I just can’t respect initiating the contact, pretending to play physical, and then flailing. It’s such a grift. Chris Paul, James Harden bullshit || It’s not even close to the same thing as a pump fake. A pump fake is meant to punish an undisciplined defender who puts themselves out of position.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"""Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""Shai"" OR ""Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""The Shai""",2025-03-25,nbadiscussion,1jjtadi,Which players are most deserving of DPOY/Defensive Teams? An analytical deep-dive.,"It's well established that defense is the hardest thing to capture in basketball, with stats. We have a plethora of amazing stats to illustrate a player's impact offensively, but defensive stats, especially if used in solitude can be shoddy and filled with noise. Do a lot of blocks make somebody a good defender? Steals? DBPM?   
  
Obviously there's more to the story, hence why it's important to weed through which ones are actually of value, and use multiple validated stats to provide a complete contextual view.

*So I did just that*. I used 6 different statistics, and a player's percentile in those stats to identify his place among the rest of the NBA:  
  
1. Defensive Points Per Possession (PPP) Allowed  
2. Defensive EPM  
3. Defensive On/Off  
4. On Court DRTG  
5. Team's Defensive Ranking  
6. Defensive FG% 

To be included, candidates needed to either  
\- Have available DPOY odds on fanduel   
\- Have an on-court DRTG of <113 (about 60th percentile)

I only included players who fit the above criteria that *might* get a single all-defensive team vote (sorry Jalen Green/James Harden), who are on pace to play 65+ games and who play moderately high minutes.

**You can view the spreadsheet here:** [**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13CL-wpXffPtj4E\_k1sSd8tHVfNbQwPEpvXpTVUorwkQ/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13CL-wpXffPtj4E_k1sSd8tHVfNbQwPEpvXpTVUorwkQ/edit?usp=sharing)

And feel free to read below for a brief explanation of each stat and why it was chosen. **Some of the percentiles are relative to the rest of the NBA, some of them are relative to the rest of the candidates. I have marked either as such.**

**1. Synergy Defensive PPP**

This is basically how many points a player allows on ALL possessions that they are the primary defender. This includes when guarding all play-types such as pick n rolls, isolations, post ups, transition, off screens, cuts, putbacks etc. This includes every possession a defender guarded where the offensive player took a shot, turned it over or got to the FT line. I believe it also includes possessions where the offensive player got  an assist in Pick n Rolls.

Each player's defensive PPP is given a percentile, **relative to the rest of the NBA**, where 50th percentile is league average

**2. Defensive EPM**

By now, most of you are probably familiar with DunksAndThrees Estimated Plus Minus or EPM. It is an adjusted plus-minus model that is regularized and regressed to kill noise and actually offer insight into a player's impact on the court, above regular plus minus. It is basically the gold standard that stats like LEBRON, BPM, DPM etc. try to emulate and widely-regarded as the most well-validated and accurate adjusted plus minus model, so I chose to use its defensive stats as part of the picture. 

Each player's defensive EPM is given a percentile, **relative to the rest of the NBA**, where 50th percentile is league average

**3. Defensive On/Off Swing (PBP Stats)**

This is pretty straightforward, it is looking at a team's defensive rating (DRTG: points allowed per 100 possessions) with a player on the court vs. a team's DRTG with that player on the bench. Theoretically, a more impactful defensive player is going to cause a larger improvement in his team's DRTG than a less impactful defensive player. On/Off certainly has some noise, but it's generally one of the most relevant stats for deducing impact, particularly when it's put into context (which I'm hoping will be assisted by the inclusion of 5 other useful stats)

I was unable to get a defensive on/off percentile for everybody in the NBA, and thus each player's defensive on/off was given a percentile, **relative to the rest of the DPOY ""candidates""**, where 50th percentile is average among the other top defenders

**4. On Court DRTG**

On/Off is important, but the most important part of the on/off equation is the ""on"" part. Awards aren't won when a player is on the bench. And, ideally, a top defensive candidate should at the very least have his team's defense looking great when he's on the court.

I was unable to get a defensive on/off percentile for everybody in the NBA, and thus each player's defensive on/off was given a percentile, **relative to the rest of the DPOY ""candidates""**, where 50th percentile is average among the other top defenders

**5. Team Defensive Ranking**

The defense that a player is anchoring/playing on provides important context to this.  
  
A) Anchoring an elite defense matters. Being the anchor of a top 5 defense is a lot more important in the conversation than being the anchor of a bottom 10 defense.

B) A team's ranking is essential to contextualize on/off rankings. It takes an elite defensive player to add to and improve an already elite defensive line-up, however an average defensive player will see impressive defensive on/off swings by simply being the least garbage defender on a team filled with garbage defenders.

Improving a bottom 5 defense by 1pt DRTG is not impressive and not even definitive proof of being a good defender. Improving a top 5 defense by 1pt DRTG will get you in the DPOY discussion (noise aside). 

Each player's team is given a percentile, **relative to the rest of the NBA**, where the #1 ranked defense would be 100% percentile and the #30 ranked defense would be 0th percentile.

**6. Defensive FG% Swing**

This is simply the difference in FG% players shoot on average of specific shot attempts vs. the % players shoot on those same shot attempts when defended by the player in question. e.g. if a player shoots 50% on a his shot attempt on average, but 45% on those same attempts when guarded by the player, the player's defensive FG% would be -5% (lower is better). 

I was unable to get a defensive FG% percentiles for everybody in the NBA, and thus each player's defensive FG% was given a percentile, **relative to the rest of the DPOY ""candidates""**, where 50th percentile is average among the other top defenders

2. Ivica Zubac (97.6th %ile) *+25000*

3. Jaren Jackson Jr. (96.3rd %ile) *+3000*

This is wildly overstating D-EPM's status in the analytics community.  Of the 3 best-regarded publicly available advanced metrics, D-LEBRON consistently gives the best results for defense vs eyetest.

Also averaging a regressed stat with raw On/Off and On Court DRTG is just watering down the regression.  Using Synergy Def-PPP seems to have negative value.  Any weight for Team DRTG (for ""who should get it"" not trying to recreate voter biases) is laughable.  None of these are weighted for opposition like any good advanced metric would be.

Also, Sengun is widely considered a bad defender (at best average). Are people completely wrong about him, or are those defensive stats trash? || [removed] || What’s your take on the offence/defence entanglement?

It’s easier to defend after a bucket than a turnover, and especially easy to defend after free throws. So SGA improves OKC’s defensive rating by getting to the line a lot. Without Jokic the nuggets turn it over a lot and give up more in transition.

This effect is real in the stats but most people don’t like to include it in their mental model of what defence really is. Generally people think of defence as how much you change the odds of the opponents’ scoring situations. Giving the opponent fewer breaks and more half-court doesn’t feel like defence as such. || I'm just here to say that SGA's defense should put him firmly in control of the MVP.

If he's leading this year I imagine he'd be even more dominant in prior years. As a jazz fan I've watched his career since his rookie season.

I think the Jokic vs Shai conversation is a very accurate representation of the discourse on what defines an mvp. 

Is it purely who the best player is? I mean that would make sense given “most valuable.” Who is the MOST valuable to their team. Imo, that is jokic. He’s the best player in the league; he’s averaging a triple double. 

On the other hand, this is a regular season award. Shai is averaging 32, 5, and 6 on 52% shooting as a guard, while being the best player on a team that’s winning their division by 14 games. That HAS to mean something, and that has to be rewarded.

I don’t think things like voter fatigue - IE - that guy win last year so he shouldn’t get it this year should play as big a role, although it historically has, as once again it’s a singular season award IMO, so free of bias from last year or the coming seasons.

But I also recognise that there’s typically multiple guys having great years on good teams that CAN win it so I don’t get too sad if the one I want to win doesn’t get it. || Shai is right there is terms of ""best player"" as well as being on a team that's 17 games ahead of the Nuggets in the loss column.

The number 1 thing voters have always taken into account is wins, and the number 2 thing is individual excellence. Jokic's numbers are better than Shai's, but winning matters the most, and right now there is a 16 win difference between their teams. Now, if Shai was just averaging like 25-5-5, Jokic would be the favorite to win, but he's not. Shai is averaging 33-5-6, and will be the scoring champion. Every single player to win the scoring title and have the best regular season record in the NBA has won league MVP that year. || I heard someone say that statistically the Nuggets are the worst team in the NBA without Jokic, and with him, they're statistically the best team in the league. I don't know if that's true (wouldn't surprise me), and I don't know how the Thunder look with and without SGA (presumably not as night-and-day as Denver with/without Jokic), but I think Jokic has as much of a case as he ever has.

What I don't understand is why Westbrook won MVP on a 6th seed, but winning now supersedes everything. I mean, I know why-- Westbrook averaged a 30-point triple-double, and was rewarded for his statistical excellence.

But Jokic is averaging a 29.7-point triple-double on an absolutely blazing 66% TS, with a much better AST/TO ratio than 2017 Westbrook. There is an easy argument that 2025 Jokic > 2017 Westbrook, but now all of a sudden he can't win MVP because his team isn't good enough?

It feels like it's because Westbrook broke the seal on averaging a high-scoring triple-double, proving it's possible in the modern era. If Westbrook had never done it, Jokic would be running away with this MVP because *he'd* be the one in that ""OMG, this has never been done, what are we seeing, how can he not be MVP regardless of team success"" position. || To (hopefully) contribute something new to this discussion, I think that this season may add some new discourse to the conversation for the first time in a long time. I'd love if voters could just rethink the way they vote a little. We kind of know the ""unspoken"" criteria, but, let's be honest, it kind of sucks.  Basketball is a team sport, that's true, but record should not factor very much into MVP. The award for being the best team is home court advantage. The award for best player is MVP. It should be considered a little so that MVP doesn't go to LaMelo Ball, but just not nearly as much as it always has.

In this era of hyper analyzed statistical basketball, we should be able ot just prove who checks the most boxes between ""valuable"" and ""best"", and it has to be Jokic. Advanced stats are showing that the Nuggets are the best offense in the league with Jokic on the floor and nearly the worst without him on the floor. How is that not the definition of MVP?

Shai will win, and not-undeservedly so, but there will definitely be backlash that hopefully causes some voters to re-examine the criteria. If Jokic doesn't ""deserve"" it off this season, what would an elite player on a so-so team have to do to win? || [removed] || [removed] || Jokic has been best player and mvp for awhile now. Much like Jordan and LeBron before him. Anything else is just making arguments for someone not as worthy for one reason or another.


Like Shai is awesome, great player too watch and great teammate, but he's not really in the same stratosphere as Jokic and it is not even really close.


MVP is the guy that makes the media the most money it's that simple imo. || There is no ""should"". Everyone has their own way of evaluating MVP.

The term MVP itself is not obvious and open to interpretation. Most valuable to who? What is the value we're suppose to evaluate? There is no official answer and thus there should be no standard. It should be up to the voters' to make their own individual standard that produce a collective MVP for that season. || The only reason someone would pick Shai is because he has more wins. And that really comes down to only one thing: he has a better team.

If that is the basis for an MVP award, it’s flawed. Shai is having an historical season, what Jokic is doing though wasn’t even fathomable just as recent as 10 years ago.

Before his rise to stardom, if I told you a Center was top three in points, rebounds, assists, and steals while shooting > 40% from three on a legit amount of attempts, they would have sent me to Salem, Mass.

I’m sorry Shai won’t receive deserved recognition, but this isn’t his award to win. || I don’t think it should be complicated. 

The point of the game is winning, therefore, winning is the most valuable thing. 

MVP should be the most valuable player on the team with the best record. 

I’m okay with stretching that to having the best record in either conference, or having the second best record if it’s better than the winner of the other conference. 

If we’re talking about most production, highest x or y stat etc., that’s a different story. 

We should have counting stats awards for those things (or per game stats over a certain number of games) || [removed] || [removed] || [deleted] || [removed] || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || [removed] || A lot of these advanced stats are win-based so of course SGA will lead in them because he's on the much better team. 

Jokic being close in a lot of these stats based on wins, despite not having the same supporting cast and having to shoulder a bigger load should be to his credit - not be held against him. || Yeah I agree. Regular season production is the key. And regardless of stats, because both player’s are phenomenal, Shai is producing at a higher level. I think the reason the comparison is so debated is because jokic has won the mvp the past couple of years because he was the best player in the league, and although I believe he’s still the best player in the league, he’s no longer the mvp. Mvp is isolated to a single season. And this season is evidently Shai’s || those statistics are always bogus and too simple. Just either citing team ratings or raw +/- data

EPM points to SGA being more impactful and nobody can accept it. || >If Jokic doesn't ""deserve"" it off this season, what would an elite player on a so-so team have to do to win?

Well, nobody is saying he doesn't deserve it. Two players can deserve it. But only one can win it. What would an elite player on a so-so team have to do? I feel like the answer is relatively clear.

He would need to *not* be going against another all-time season from a player who is leading his team to a much better record. || Our sub is for in-depth discussion. Low-effort comments or stating opinions as facts are not permitted.

SGA does a lot for his team offensively and defensively, and Jokic does a lot for his team offensively

SGA leads Jokic in the best advanced stat available in EPM, and leads in wins. The only thing you can argue is that the edge goes to Jokic by the eye test, and even that's more like 60/40. 

There's nights where Jokic just completely disappears. || > if you are seriously stupid enough to argue that Jokic isn’t actually more valuable

""anyone who disagrees with me is stupid""

> There is not a player in the NBA you could replace Jokic with to even make Denver a playoff team.

Let's stop pretending the Nuggets supporting cast is the 2007 Cavaliers, lots of players could lead and have led similar supporting casts to the playoffs.  The difference between Denver not being a playoff team and what we have now is going to be like 5 wins.  Meanwhile OKC dropping to ""top 3"" might mean they lost 16 more games. By your own hypothetical measures we could argue that OKC dropped further. || OKC dropping from easily the best team in the league to maybe a top 3 seed is a huge drop off. 

Also the “SGA is a fake MVP” people don’t want to see all the facts. OKC has the best point differential in NBA history, best record in the west by a lot, best record in the NBA, #2 net rating in NBA history, and if you removed 10 points from them every game they’d still be the 1 seed.

All that and they’ve been one of the most injured teams in the league. 

Jalen Williams has missed 11 games, Chet Holmgren has missed 48 games, Isaiah Hartenstein has missed 22 games, so the other 3 best players on his team have all missed games. Key role players have also missed games with Cason Wallace missing 11 games, Caruso missing 25 games, and Ajay Mitchell missing 41 games. Not only that, but there were several games where all 3 OKC centers (Chet Holmgren, Isaiah Hartenstein, and Jaylin Williams) were all injured and 6’5” Jalen Williams started at center. OKC has played only 9 games with their preferred starting lineup (SGA, Dort, Jalen, Chet, Hartenstein). So who hasn’t been injured while OKC was the best team in the league? SGA, who has only missed 3 games

You combine the absolute dominance of this team with all the injuries and you realize there’s only one constant: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. You want to act like Jamal Murray, MPJ, Christian Braun, and Aaron Gordon is the worst team ever that’s fine, but don’t change up and act like SGA has the best team ever when LITERALLY ALL OF HIS TEAMMATES HAVE BEEN INJURED!

If the supporting cast is an argument for Jokic, it’s an even bigger argument for SGA because his supporting cast has been injured literally all year

This argument is stupid anyway. You’re basically saying Jokic deserves MVP because Denver’s front office sucks and OKC has maybe the best front office. || Please keep your comments civil.

**Gary Payton** (in his last season in Seattle) and **Brent Barry** had VORPs of **5.9** and **5.8** respectively with **Rashard Lewis** contributing a **3.2** VORP. Everyone else on the team had a VORP **below 1.0**.

By comparison, the championship Lakers that year, which were extremely top heavy as well, had **Shaq** (**6.1**), **Kobe** (**5.2**), **Horry** (**3.0**). Top heavy, but actually slightly less so than those Sonics. They had players with VORPs above 1.0. The LeBron Heat teams which are another obvious candidate had other contributors with VORPs above 1.0 as well outside their Big 3.

By comparison, this season, only 3 players in the entire league have VORPs above 5.0 - **Jokic** (**9.1**), **Shai** (**8.6**), and **Giannis** (**6.0**). The next closest is **Tatum** at **4.6**.

I looked for teams this year with at least 2 players with a VORP at 3.2 or above and saw these 5:

* Thunder: Shai (8.6), Jalen Williams (3.2)
* Cavaliers: Jarrett Allen (3.5), Evan Mobley (3.3)
* Celtics: Jayson Tatum (4.6), Derrick White (3.3)
* Knicks: Josh Hart (3.4), Karl-Anthony Towns (3.3)
* Bucks: Giannis (6.0), Damian Lillard (3.2)

By the end of the year, the Rockets may have 2 players qualify (Amen Thompson is at 3.1 and Sengun is already at 3.8) and the Cavaliers may have 3 (Mitchell is at 3.1).

Not a single team this year has 3 players with a 3.2 VORP or better though. And every playoff team has contributions with VORPs over 1.0.

  
Does anyone remember this Sonics team? Statistically, they had a better Big 3 than the championship Lakers and the #2 contender Spurs. In fact, Payton and Barry seemed to be a better big 2 than both Shaq and Kobe and Duncan and Robinson. But they got little contribution elsewhere outside Rashard Lewis.",53,14,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jrea75/200102_seattle_supersonics_most_top_heavy_playoff/,2025-04-04 11:12:30,"Man, I loved that team.

the reigning champs had the problem that they took too long to transition between the inefficient duncan led offense to a efficient ginobili led offense, parker won the fmvp and wants a larger role but he is simply not good enough. duncan is out of his prime, ginobili has 2 years left, parker has not entered it yet. the team is not constructed for the necessary change, instead they stick with the old players and to stagger the parker minutes they keep bringing ginobili from the bench.

the team looks like this, only 6 regular players average at least 20min

Duncan (31) 34mpg **VORP 4.8** BPM 5.2 **TS% 54**

Parker (25) 33mpg **VORP 2.6** BPM 2.4 **TS% 54**

Finley (34) 26mpg **VORP 0.8** BPM -0.6 TS% 51

Oberto (32) 20mpg **VORP 1.0** BPM 0.4 TS% 61

they finish 56-26 only 1 game behind the 1st seeded Lakers. in the playoffs they reach the WCF but fall to the Lakers 1-4. Ginobili was dealing with an injury that made him lose his speed and elevation the entire run and the old guys could not rise to the level.

this is a good example of a typical playoff-build team, and why they fail. playoff teams need a sixth man kind of player to shake things up when things like injuries happen.

this season to me that team is the warriors. they look good for the last 20 or so games but in the playoffs it is very likely that if they can advance they will start dealing with minor injuries and it doesn't look like they have that Poole type of player like the last time they won. || Was it Vlad Radmanovic with the braids or was it the year after? || I think the '76 Lakers might edge them out with Kareem posting a 9.1 and the entire team going for just 10.2 ('22 Nuggets at 12.4 total).

I am no mathematician and I do not know much about statistics, so I just decided to take some time and find the answer to the easiest question:

*What is the average rank for each All-NBA eligible player across multiple popular advanced metrics this season?*

This was more for my personal curiosity. I do not claim that this method actually has any validity or importance, but I did the work so I thought I would share.

**METHOD:**

*stats collected on 4/3*

To do this I referenced the 8 following advanced metrics that I see commonly used:

EPM, EW, LEBRON WAR(LW), RAPTOR WAR(RW), DARKO DPM(DPM), PER, WS, and VORP

I decided to include both EPM and EW because I think EPM is the best advanced metric so I wanted to give it some extra weight.

In order to compile the list of players best deserving of All-NBA recognition, I first went through each advanced metric for this season and gave each player a tally for an appearance in the top 20 in each of the stats.

I ended up with a list of 23 players who appeared in the top 20 in >3 out of the 8 stats, who are also likely to meet the 65 games played requirement. I had a few players that surprised me, but generally speaking it aligned with my preconceived idea of who was in contention for All-NBA recognition so I decided to roll with it. The only notable omission was Cade Cunningham who appeared in the top 20 in only 2 out of the 8 advanced metrics. Due to his narrative and likelihood of achieving All-NBA recognition, I included him.

Here are the 24 players:

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

Nikola Jokic

Giannis Antetokounmpo (Likely)

Jayson Tatum

Evan Mobley

Donovan Mitchell

Tyrese Haliburton

Ivica Zubac

Stephen Curry (Likely)

Darius Garland

Derrick White

Jarret Allen

Anthony Edwards

Karl-Anthony Towns

Domantas Sabonis (Likely)

Alperen Sengun

James Harden

Jalen Williams

Josh Hart

LeBron James

Tyler Herro

Jaren Jackson Jr.

Jalen Brunson (Likely)

Cade Cunningham

In the following table, I list each player with each of their respective RANKS in each advanced metric. This is not the metric itself, it is just the RANK in which their metric lies in comparison to their peers. 14 in the table means the 14th best number in the league for that respective stat.

At the end of the table, I include two averages. The first average is their average rank across all 8 advanced metrics. The second average (AVG(IMP)) is their average rank across the 5 all around impact metrics (EPM, EW, RAPTOR WAR, LEBRON WAR, and DARKO DPM). I believe these metrics to be different in kind to the others, so I wanted to see their averages separately.

**NOTES**

\-Haliburton being so loved by advanced metrics definitely surprised me given the narrative about him earlier this season. I would be curious to see his metrics if he can put together a full season of consistent play. Advanced metrics understandably love you if you push pace, generate great looks, and rarely turn the ball over.

\-Derrick White being so beloved by advanced metrics was not necessarily surprising, but the fact that it was enough to rank top 15 in this group of players is impressive. He is the epitome of a winning player.

\-While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated. I believe he deserves a lot more love for his performance this season(DPOY anyone?).

\-LeBron, JJJ, Brunson, and Cade not ranking well is definitely not what I expected going into this. Most of the conversation around these players land them in Second Team at worst and I have even heard arguments around these players to claim the 5th First Team spot.

(Looking to see how EW calculated…) || Man Zubac is awesome, eye test tells me he's a great center -- but I still think there is some black box of these stats where they are giving what a center does more weight than other positions.

**Edited** to mention their extremely great health this season has a lot to do with it as they're all eligible for these honors. || I did that a while back and was really surprised how each metrics have their clear bias baked in yet top 4, r guys seem to be all unanimous. Like EPM favors offensive usage, LEBRON favors players that fit well into winning teams, DARKO really favors establish stats, etc. but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context. These metrics are really helpful to find out underrated role players, but for stars, they can be extremely misleading. || It’s crazy that the Cavs best player isn’t even one of the 4 in this analysis  || Very interesting perspective, thank you for sharing!

Zubac is a beast || Interesting stuff. Thanks for gathering this data and breaking it all down. Unfortunately, I think you're right that due to media narrative, there is no chance Brunson and LeBron get left off, and it's likely that Cade and JJJ will make it. Although those guys have all had very good seasons so it's not like it will be a travesty for any one of them to get the nod.

Zubac has almost no chance, as deserving as he is (I've been very impressed with him in the few clippers games I've watched this year) and White and Allen will likely miss the cut. I'd love to see Allen make it. The guy is such a great two way player and he's so unselfish on offense. He really makes the Cavs a much better team. || Jarrett Allen and Ivica Zubac ranking #3 and #4 in win shares is an indictment of that statistic.

> While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated.

I agree with the first part of your statement. But given that reality, why are you then trying to use these insignificant statistics to draw conclusions?

Zubac and Allen have roles to play and they play them well, but role players don't deserve to be ranked ahead of guys like Brunson or Cunningham who have far more difficult burdens to carry. || Why would you base it off metrics nobody uses?

Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil.  They’re useless.  

Obviously this isn’t how the teams are selected.  

Harden hasn’t made an all nba team in 5 years and he’s not going to make one over LeBron, who was the February player of the month and 5th on mvp ladder. || [removed] || Ultimately, the players are very close in a lot of these metrics so one good game or bad game down the stretch could vastly change the calculus for this analysis. 

  
For example, Ant had a good game last night and EW updated so now Ant is up from #10 all the way to #5. This alone would likely push Ant firmly into second team if I were to re run the analysis. But as of 4/3, these were the rankings. || Before Kawhi started playing like Kawhi, I thought Zubac was easily the most important Clipper. And for a team that was projected to be a lottery team to have a shot at 50-wins, that's Hella impressive || PER notoriously overweighs rebounding, so bigs pretty much always have higher PER than guards of similar quality. TBH it's a very flawed advanced stat that shouldnt be included in any analysis including this one imo. || The hate towards him was crazy. The people that were saying that haven't actually watched him play in a meaningful amount. He is the best pure creator in the league, hands down. His three point shooting, while streaky at times, is upper echelon. His defense is improving significantly as he gets more experience. He has moved to being a solidly average defender, when he was often a genuine liability in the past.

He still catches hate from people who like to make similar arguments against him that people do for John Stockton. It's baffling to me that people attempt to make straight faced arguments against these players because they make a high volume of ""easy assists"". You are seriously going to hold it against a player because they are capable of coordinating an offense so effectively, that they are able to very consistently get good shooters open shots, in spots that they shoot particularly well from? That is a testament to their ability as a creator, not a detrimental attribute. || The irony about the ""one good month"" thing is that it's really one bad month that tricked people. He was All-NBA last year and will likely be again this year. He had a bad start to the year but is putting up historically efficient numbers. It's basically him and prime CP3 in terms of this combination of scoring and assist volume + efficiency. Nobody else in NBA history has done this. || It’s the same story around the current MVP debate. For a huge amount of NBA fans, box score is the only value you bring to a team. Offensive output, advanced metrics, film, team success, none of it matters compared to that box score that you can glance at for five seconds and determine how valuable a player is. || The reality is that Allen not being worthy of an all-star this year is mostly a numbers thing, getting four players in is pretty ridiculous given how much talent there is around the league. But having watched most of our games this year, I think it's debatable that he's even our fourth-best player, especially if you consider his defensive impact. He's also the type of player to be underrated by casual/occasional viewers, because he does a lot that doesn't show up on the scoreboard. || >but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context.

Do these metrics underrate these players or are you just over rating them? 

Harden, Herro, and Cade all have good advanced stats. They all carry fairly poor offences || Yes, the biggest reason for this is that none of these stats measure on-ball defensive attention drawn and the benefits that it leads to for other players on the team at the risk of deflating counting stats of the player drawing the attention.

Making open looks as the 3rd/4th option on your team and ending up with a high TS% does not make a player better than say a Cade Cunningham or Donovan Mitchell.

It’s similar to how Ayton had distinctly better advanced numbers than Luka in their rookie seasons along with strong box score numbers at incredible efficiency yet anyone watching knew he was Ayton was a play finisher role player on a fully firing suns team and Luka was the entire Mavs offence. || 2025 is certainly the year of our Lord Tyrone Jerome. || What makes Zubac a role player? He's averaging 17 and 13 playing 33 MPG while anchoring the Clippers' defense. He's contending for the most important player on the team right next to Harden and Kawhi. || > Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil. They’re useless.
> 
> 

Publicly available defensive metrics, absolutely. There's basically zero value in those.

Publicly available overall metrics are solid. The vast majority of basketball value comes from offense and we can measure most of that. It's imperfect, but it's a very good way to determine who's in the ballpark. || My understanding is a lot of these stats weigh a bunch of counting stats heavier for centers than other roles -- which is OK up to a point because maybe a center getting an assist is more valuable than a PG doing the same, but it's hard to know. PER people who know seem to generally perceive as antiquated, right? || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || As someone who doesn't watch much Indiana or Charlotte basketball,  I'm really curious how Haliburton and Ball compare now. And to a lesser extent, Ant.  
Thinking back, man, that was a really fun draft class. || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || It's so weird, he was an all-star and top-tier playmaker an entire year on the Pacers in 22-23 season. His second half of the season in 21-22, when he was traded to the Pacers, was also really really good. His shooting averages have been good his entire career. ""One good month"" people are trolls or need to have their eyes checked because all you need to do is watch 48 minutes of the Pacers and you'll see him constantly trapped and doubled _at the logo_ and instead of playing hero ball he swings it because someone will be open, whether it counts in his box score or not.

But it's no surprise, average basketball fans are really really stupid when it comes to elite playmakers. Jokic was clowned for years and now pretty much everyone recognize how incredible he is. I wonder, what is the difference between now and years before? Ring finger, that's it. || Wouldn't models that include plus/minus stats account for this? Even if you don't necessarily generate an assist or made shot, if your ""gravity"" is actually opening things for teammates and contributing to winning it will show up in the plus/minus.",0.0,0.652,0.348,0.5859,0.032,0.837,0.132,0.9987,0.097,0.711,0.192,0.9997
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander,"""Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""Shai"" OR ""Gilgeous-Alexander"" OR ""The Shai""",2025-04-08,nbadiscussion,1jv3noc,Watching both the NBA and soccer this season I've noticed some distinct parallels between the seasons of Mo Salah and Giannis,"Alright, this one is a bit obscure to be honest but just hear me out.

Mohamed Salah and Giannis Antetokounmpo have both had incredible seasons but you wouldn’t always know that from how the media talks about them Salah has been on fire for Liverpool with 27 goals and 17 assists in 31 games which if you don't watch football/soccer is by far the best stastical season of any player in the world currently.

That’s 44 goal contributions and yet people keep asking if he’s finished and criticise him in favour of players like Raphinha or Dembele.

No disrespect to those guys but Salah’s been doing this every season for years now and still gets overlooked in the Ballon dor talk by the media especially.

On the basketball side Giannis is averagingbover 30 points nearly 12 rebounds and 6 assists per game which puts him right up there with the best in the league and is probably his best season overall based on statistics and efficiency.

But in the MVP conversation it’s all about Jokic and Shai right now. It's s not that they don’t deserve it but Giannis is putting up historic numbers and everyone treats him like a distant 3rd place rather than a genuine mvp candidate. We've seen no one in the media push for any Giannis mvp inclusion (not saying he should win it but people acting like the gap is massive just seems unfair to me when giannis is also one of the best defenders in the league.

Another thing is that both guys have struggled due to their teams letting them down at times this season, Liverpool getting knocked out of the champions league early didn't do Salah any favours, sure he played badly but no one else turned up when Salah was being double teamed every time he touched the ball. Similarly, the bucks have struggled overall due to injuries and really no one is performing at a high level other than Giannis and Dame who is out for the season.


Both guys also get clowned for how they play
Salah is direct and clinical but some fans act like that’s boring or not beautiful football because he's not a great dribbler even though his passing has become elite. 

Giannis bulldozes his way to the rim and dominates physically but people criticize him for being a below average shooter and call him a 'run and dunk man' even though his mid range has improved massively.

Even though what they do is insanely effective and hard to stop they don’t get the same love as some of their flashier peers

It’s wild how two of the best athletes in the world can keep performing at this level and still be underrated in conversations about the best in the game. They’re victims of their own consistency. When they shine people say yeah but he always does that. When they have a quiet game suddenly everyone’s talking about decline.

Whether it’s MVP or Ballon dor they’re always in the mix but never really the favorite And honestly they deserve way more credit for carrying their teams and doing it year after year without slowing down.


",42,28,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jv3noc/watching_both_the_nba_and_soccer_this_season_ive/,2025-04-09 07:39:21,"It’s a fun comparison but you’ve lost me pretty early on saying Salah is having an incredible season but not being given credit by the media…there’s a new Opta stat about Salah every single week. 

Before the PSG game he was being talked about endlessly. They’re going to win the league and he’s already won every player of the year award that exists in England.

Giannis is having a much quieter season in large part due to his team being bad. Both have consistently gotten their flowers but when you get knocked out of the CL in the R16 and Barcelona are breaking their own goal scoring records, it’s not hard to see why the attention shifts. Not to mention Salah’s form drops when Trent is out of the team and the last few weeks it’s not been all that easy for him.

Giannis will always be ranked in the top 3-5 players no matter who you ask. But they’re not an exciting team and don’t have a lot going for them this season. If they rally in the playoffs and make a run the noise will change, that’s the nature of the league. || I don’t think Giannis is disrespected somehow this season. The Bucks just suck. They’re old, have a notoriously meme-inspiring coach and they’ve kinda just pranced around all season with no identity on either end of the ball. They’re in the East and about to be 5th or 6th, which is as mediocre as it gets among teams in the playoffs. The IST win was nice for them, but that’s inconsequential to anything in the playoffs. 

I also don’t think there’s any recourse about Giannis being less than the third best player in the league this year, which is fair. He doesn’t get as much attention because he’s not doing better in either department than the two guys having historic seasons ahead of him in the MVP race. || That's very contrived of you. Salah is not far better than the next best players - that is simply statistically wrong. Viktor Gyökeres or Robert Lewandowski don't have numbers that are far removed from that.
As for Giannis, I can't understand why you feel that way. I obviously read other news sites and am on different threads than you. Nobody is underestimating Giannis or not giving him the credit he deserves. These are just individual trolls but that's not the general attitude of NBA fans or journalists. I don't see any commonality at all in the perception or performance of the two athletes. || OMG Liverpool fans are now invading the NBA forums. Salah has been spoken of plenty in the media before Liverpool got knocked out of the CL, he was the favorite to win the Balon Dor up until that point. And Liverpool have already secured the title so there’s nothing to talk about there. Yeah he’s having an amazing amazing season but let’s not act like he hasn’t gotten all his flowers. He’s gonna go down as one of the best PL wingers of all time. As for Giannis, he’s been awesome but unfortunately his team has a very little chance to make it out the East, 2 of the 3 most dominant teams this season are in the East. || As a United fan, I'm staying away from commenting on the football side of this ;)

As for Giannis, he IS a distant third this season. Not because what he's doing isn't astonishing, but because the other two are putting up historically unprecedented numbers all season long. Also, if you look at betting odds and mock ballots, it's now basically sewn up for SGA. In a ""normal"" season about 4-5 years ago, what Giannis has done this year would dominate the MVP conversation, but the other two have elevated their play to absurd heights. I can't be arsed to look up the exact splits right now, but I recall reading this year that the Bucks on/off numbers aren't as dramatically different as the other two as a good indicator. But that was before Lillard's blood clot. || Comparing Giannis to Mo is not correct... Giannis is someone like Kane: in form, never drops stinkers, but their team sucks. || If Salah wanted a ballon d’or maybe he should have tried doing literally anything against PSG || The Bucks have the 13th best record in the NBA, and Giannis's counting stats do not separate him from Shai and Joker at all (fewer points than Shai, fewer rebounds and assists than Joker). Shai is the best player on a team having an historic regular season. He leads the league in scoring, and is playing All-NBA defense. Joker is top three in the NBA in ppg, rpg, and apg while his team is not elite they could still to 50 wins.

Giannis is correctly locked in third place with the season he is having. It some years, his numbers (and if he was on a 50-win team) he would probably win the MVP. This is not one of those years.

Side note, I think if the Nuggets had held onto the #2 seed, that Jokic would have a shot at keeping it close. With his team falling to 4, 5 or 6 (7 and 8 are still possible for them), I highly doubt it is even close. || In all fairness, Salah was getting his flowers from the media and widely talked about as being the in form best player in the world. This hype went up until he ghosted in the 2nd leg against PSG and got knocked out of the champions league. The Champs is the biggest competition in football this year (as no WC this year) so naturally the players who perform in this tournament are going to get more praise from the media.

Raphinha and Dembele are still competing in the champs and one is likely going to win it as the best player on their team. The media is right to focus on these two at the moment. 

Liverpool have basically already won the premier league so there is no real reason to continue to discuss that competition. There is basically no reason for the media to continue to talk about Salah as there is no new narrative or Liverpool to report (other than if Salah signs a new contract or not). || This is honestly an amazing take. Two completely underrated and under the radar greats. My only argument is that raphina is currently playing out of his mind and plays for probably the most entertaining team since the Messi Barcelona years, so I see why people prefer him. 

Giannas and Salah are both so insanely direct all the time that’s a crazy comp.  || This. And Salah was invisible in the games against PSG. The Champions League is the biggest competition this season so it will just be normal that Salah will not win Ballon d’Or || I understand that the Bucks are in the East, but their record is pretty similar to the Nuggets and they might end up the higher seed. While the West has more depth, the East is very strong at the top. 

I have Jokic over Giannis, but idk if “the Bucks just suck” then Denver isn’t too great. Certainly no one holds a candle to OKC || He has comparable goal numbers to Lewandowski and Gyokeres (whos playing in Portugal not a top 5 league) and has the most assists in the top 5 leagues in europe. Both Lewandowski and Gyokeres are purely goalscorers, Salah does both. || I do not follow EPL, and I have see a ton of stuff in passing about the incredible year Salah is having. Me being aware of it makes me feel like the OP's premise is flimsy. || I agree to an extent but I think Salah is more accurate cause their styles of play are very similar in how direct they are. Not to mention I don't think team sucks can apply to kane anymore now that he's at Bayern but with spurs i agree. || This. He dropped the ball, ballon d'or is gone for him. || Oh, I’m not denouncing the Bucks in favor of the Nuggets. Each of them has their own shit to deal with. Each team has suffered extended injuries for key players and that will inevitably impact their record. 

It’s the fact that Jokic is doing crazy shit that takes away from the spotlight on Giannis. Couple that with OKC’s record and Shai’s stats and the reasons for Giannis not being talked as much are pretty evident. || They're not even 4th in their Mickey Mouse conference. || Bringing up that Gyokeres is not in a top 5 league is silly given that he also scored 6 goals in his 8 Champions league appearances. || Bullshit 
Sporting is a top 16 club in Europe. There are reasons why the top players from Portugal usually end up at top clubs. 
Gyökeres has 7 assists as well as goals in the league alone. Pure goalscorer my arse. And as far as Lewandowski's role is concerned, that's total bullshit. No striker on the planet drops back and plays with his back to goal as effectively as Lewy. He creates spaces and ties down opponents to then link up his colleagues like no other. This has been one of his premium skills for many years. But you know better and say he's a pure goalscorer. || Bayern are mediocre at best in Europe... The only reason they are at the top of Bundesliga is that the other teams are dropping points whenever Bayern are losing. || Sporting being one of the best clubs in Europe doesn't change that Portugal league is not top 5. It even strengthens the argument since it makes it easier for Sporting to score goals with such a discrepancy between them and most of the competition. || Ok well regardless of wether or not you agree with the take that they are pure goalscorers or not it doesn't change that Salah has 4 less goals and 11 more assists than gyokeres, and 2 more goals and 15 more assists than lewy in their respective leagues. Salah simply brings more to an attack than either of them even if they aren't pure goalscorers. || Thing is Bayern have all the tools to be the best team in the world, they have elite players in almost every position, world class X factor players like Kane and Musiala, they are run well and were the most profitable club in the world last season (maybe second to madrid I don't remember), they have experience in the likes of Neuer Muller and Kimmich. Honestly I don't even know why they're quite average, this might be a case where the manager is to blame here, I don't know why they chose to hire Kompany. || The league is not great, but we hear this same stuff all the time and then players like Luis Diaz go on and do great at the next level.

Gyokeres does it for Sweden, he does in the in the champions league. This talk about being unproven is just a bit of a coping mechanism. He was elite in the championship the year before, and while Sporting do play against poor competition you don’t need to look THAT hard at why he’s so widely celebrated. || You claimed Salah is far away than anyone else. Shall we talk about Kane's numbers if you don't like the other examples ? Boy you've lost your way here, realise it. || Salah has 27 goals and 17 assists in the prem, Kane has 23 goals and 7 assists in the Bundesliga which is a weaker league defensively.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.099,0.732,0.169,0.9947,0.075,0.765,0.161,0.9997
