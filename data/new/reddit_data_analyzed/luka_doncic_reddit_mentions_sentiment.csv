Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-02-10,nbadiscussion,1ingzag,The Luka Doncic Trade is the Most Fascinating in NBA History,"

**Transaction Notes:**

We can debate the merits of remaining competitive but once we accept that as a goal, there probably wasn’t a better deal on the market. Luka is a free agent in the summer of 2026 so whoever is trading for him has to convince him to re-sign in less than 18 months. Imagine a world where the Rockets empty the clip and trade Sengun + Amen + picks for Luka, why would he re-sign with that team with all of his other options on the table?

Luka is going to have his pick of any team in the league in the summer of 2026. Cap space doesn’t really matter when a player of Luka’s calibre is on the market. Every team will be a suitor. I’ve been following the NBA for a long time and there have been countless examples (anyone remember Butler to Miami being impossible because of cap space) of this.

If Luka wants to play with Wemby, the Spurs will make it happen. If he wants to play with Jokic, the Nuggets will make it happen. If he wants to play with Tatum, the Celtics will make it happen. If he wants to play with Giannis, the Bucks will make it happen. This is what the Lakers are up against and I suspect how they were able to hold back assets in the deal. It has already been reported that they asked to speak to Luka about signing an extension before the trade and were denied permission. 

The Mavs should have extracted more value from the Lakers (I think a trade of AD + Reaves for Luka would have been accurate pricing) but certainly not AD + Reaves + Christie + both picks and all possible swaps like I’ve seen others propose. 

**Luka Notes:**

Luka is out of shape for an NBA player. Yes, he’s still a tremendous player but I think the pendulum has swung too far on this. Citing his minutes load as evidence of his shape is silly, you can play lots of minutes while being out of shape, your fitness affects what you do during those minutes.  It’s a testament to his skill level that he’s still able to play as well as he does despite this but it is a real issue. The all time greats Luka is compared to had kinks to work out but nobody would ever accuse them of not trying to squeeze every ounce of talent out of their bodies. 

I have never read an article about LeBron, Jordan, Kobe, Duncan, KG, Giannis being so flagrantly out of shape. Jokic famously took a leap when he decided he wanted to take his body seriously and stopped drinking three 2L bottles of coke every day. Many hoped that after last year’s bitter defeat in the Finals Luka would come into this year committed to fitness and diet. Instead there were articles about him smoking cigarettes and drinking beer during the Olympics. Mavs fans will never admit it now but just go into their subreddit and type “Luka conditioning” to see their unvarnished thoughts. 

Luka has a lot of what I would call “non-winning” habits. He doesn’t impact the defensive side of the ball, he doesn’t set good screens, he doesn’t box out, he doesn’t move without the ball, he doesn’t change ends quickly, he doesn’t fight over or through screens, he’s never first to the floor etc. 

This is all great news for Luka because there’s so much room for improvement. He’s honestly barely scratched the surface of the player he could be if he became more serious about the game. The bad news is that we’re 7 years into his career and there hasn’t really been another star of his calibre I can think of that took this long to become “serious”. Many people say you either have it or you don’t and the Mavs had a front row seat to him and decided that he wasn’t going to change. Luka is well beyond Embiid as a playoff performer but Embiid is example of the issues that can arise when a superstar player never “grows up” and commits themselves to the small, mundane things that lead to winning. 

**Lakers Notes:**

The Lakers were closer to competing for a title this year prior to the Luka trade than they were generally given credit for. A lot of people wrote them off after their early season slump but since Dec 5th the Lakers have gone 20-9 with the #4 defence and #8 offence in the NBA. In this stretch AD/Luka (treating them as one player) missed 9 games.

The Lakers’ window is not as wide as people believe. Luka on his own without a second star is not going anywhere worthwhile and it’s unlikely the Lakers will sign anyone better than current LeBron. For example, the big star free agent in the summer of 2026 is JJJ — current LeBron is 2-3 tiers above JJJ. LeBron is 40 and his play is very much year to year at this point. The Lakers don’t have as much time as it may seem. 

It should not be lost on anyone that the Lakers did not skip a beat and in fact played better in AD’s absence. Anthony Davis is an incredibly talented player but his impact on the court is overstated because people have a tendency to think basketball is the sum total of offensive and defensive ability as if they are discrete and separate parts of the game. It’s really difficult to have a great defence when your center is a non shooter who mostly plays around the basket because after they’ll very often end the offensive possession near the hoop and therefore behind the play in transition or semi-transition. 

AD’s struggles changing ends was one of the largest under-discussed issues with the Lakers’ defence over the last few years. In today’s NBA it’s really difficult to have a non-shooting big be a large part of your offense because of how important floor balance and early transition defence is. IF Luka is serious about playing defence, I think the Lakers actually match up better against teams with great bigs because their center will be 100% focused on defensive responsibilities. 

All in all this is one of the most fascinating trades in NBA history and one that I think will challenge a lot of what has become “conventional wisdom” about NBA team building.

Is this why Porzingis shoots from above the break, so it's easier for him to get back on defense?

Is there a way to see the impact of how well a player runs the floor? Why is it so under-discussed? Is the impact really that much? || Why do we have to accept there wasn't a better deal on the market? This trade was bungled so badly that Nico Harrison could not even extract all of LA's assets. He didn't even get the best deal under what seemed to be his own self-imposed restriction that he wanted AD and no one else.

A player of Luka's calibre at his age has never been traded. We don't know how teams would react. Teams spend years building up assets to have the ammunition to chase stars if they become available. || I don't agree with your assessment of Luka's situation. In particular when you say he has a lot of ""non-winning habits""... But he still brings wins at an elite rate/level, so perhaps what we should reconsider if they really are ""non-winning habits""?

You cite Kobe, I think that's a good view on how ""winning habits"" can be unexpected. Sure, Kobe has an elite winning mentality and focus, and excellent conditioning. But he also clashed with Phil Jackson and with Shaq, to a certain extent being the catalyst for a team that had won 3 titles and lost one final in 5 years to break up. Despite Jackson coming back a year later, it took the Gasol trade to really bring the team back to where it had been (a trade that even at the time was seen as... favorable to the Lakers). 

Luka seems to be a pretty easy-going team-mate, and despite being a hugely ball-dominant player he's adapted his play each season to play well with whoever is on the roster. Isn't getting the maximum out of your team-mates, in particular in a small-market team a hugely valuable winning habit?

Are there ways Doncic can improve even further and be truly a once-in-a-generation player? Yes. Pretty much every player can and does. LeBron worked to add a mid-range shot after the 2007 finals where the Spurs highlighted this gap in his offensive toolset, for example. Would it be great if Doncic is 100% committed to improving his game to be this once-in-a-generation player, and agrees with the Mavs organization that his conditioning and defensive effort is the gap he needs to work on? Sure!

But the Mavs can't have their cake and eat it too. 

They're not the Lakers or other big-market teams that can attract stars. They've been to 3 finals in 45 years. 1 in 6 years with Doncic, who's not yet in his prime. Doncic was according to all reports happy in Dallas, which is an incredible stroke of luck. LeBron dropped the Cavs, just like AD and KD did to their small-market teams to seek rings/success. Getting a top-5 player for the next 6-7 years is *incredibly* good for a team like the Mavs!

Doncic might not have LeBron or Kobe's grindset mentality. He will probably never be a hyper-conditioned player like Giannis, partly because of this mindset issue, but also because athleticism isn't a major part of his playing style. But like Jokic, he has plenty of other skills / qualities that are much, much more valuable to the organization. You say Jokic improved considerably after shedding weight... Is Jokic at his ideal weight now? He's considerably heavier than AD, Markkanen or Wemby for example. Would he be -*even better*\- by dropping 30 or 50 lbs? Some would say yes - he'd be faster in defense, more agile and able to jump a little higher. Others would say no - he would lose some of the weight advantage that he leverages so well to push defenders back and create space for himself and team-mates. Similarly, would leaner, meaner Doncic be better for the organization, getting pissed off that his efforts aren't being rewarded due to the Mavs' limited ability to surround him with top-level players? Would it be better for the Mavs if he cut his weight for a season then leaves the team to chase a ring like KD or LeBron did? 

However you look at it, the result is that he's taken the Mavs to a final in his 6th season after joining the league at 19. He was committed to the team and reaching a level of success that the organization has had so rarely it's almost anecdotal. How you can square that with having a lot of ""non-winning habits"" as a reason to trade him is frankly surprising to me. || I think the most interesting thing is the Mavs are probably the best team ever to deliberately take a step back mid season with a trade.

Before the trade, they were a consensus second tier contender behind OKC, Boston and  Cleveland, together with Denver and NY. After the trade, the most frequent question was if they can avoid the play-in, and I haven’t seen anyone seriously consider that they can make the conference finals.

Moreover, this is an improved version of last year’s finals team, with more talent, deeper roster, and more versatile options for lineups and even play style. And it’s not like now or never, they had everything under control for 2 more seasons after this, with picks and assets to improve on the margins. || LeBron being 2-3 tiers above JJJ is absolutely insane. He is maximum 1 tier above. LBJ is an All-NBA level player, JJJ All-NBA/high level All-Star. || Every, single, fuckin time anthony davis goes for a layup, he goes flying past the rim on the and falls to the ground, and the other team if they are any good score in transition on a 4v5. || [removed] || It was the type of lopsided trade that would only happen for the Lakers. That is the most irritating part to me. Unlike most teams the Lakers never have to find superstars in the draft. If they don’t draft one, a superstar will just fall onto their lap. || Begs the question if Luka is this good out of shape… how good could he conceivably be if he was in his best shape? || A lot of someone's value is your ability to replace them. Dallas will never again have a player with Luka's insane combination of talent and popularity. That makes him priceless. Yet they gave him away for nothing (compared to other recent deals). Combine that with the unethical secrecy and the lack of shopping him around, it is hard to not be left with a sour taste in your mouth regardless of what team you support. The general feeling is Luka, who was the best thing ever to Dallas fans, was stolen. || Porzingas, Brunson and now Doncic. One season removed from making the nba finals to probably being destined to peak in the 2nd round with this squad. If you trade a guy that is probably 70-80% of the fanbase you better hope you’re replacing him with someone of equal value. The alternate route would be crowning else who’s younger or needs more opportunity your new franchise player (like Brunson) 

Mavs front office didn’t even try and stockpile a bunch of first rounders like Presti did for OKC. They haven’t really developed any young prospects so there wasn’t really a dual timeline.

Klay, Kyrie and AD would’ve been sick…9 years ago when they were all in their prime. One of the craftiest combo guards paired with an elite two way off ball 3pt sniper and a two way athletic beast with playmaking abilities in the front court. Throw in some quality role players around that and you have yourself a title team in today’s NBA. 

Mavs don’t really have an untouchable level player at this point. With AD in the mix they’ve really double down on old injury prone guys. Don’t get me wrong AD is still a top 10-20 player when healthy, but he rarely is. You’d think teams would’ve learned after the aging stars didn’t pan out for the Clippers. || I think long winded analysis is just an attempt to make something fundamentally senseless make sense .

Doncic is not a perfect player but he is a potential top 20 all time with 5-10 exceptional years ahead of him..simply put, with the right supporting cast he is good enough to carry a franchise to multiple championships and his value on the open market reflects that. The trade is controversial and newsworthy for the reason everyone thinks it is- because Dallas threw away a franchise player for far far less than he is worth.

There isn't some underlying logic to it, all that happened in this instance is a perfect storm of an immature and not very smart GM failing to appreciate that superstars often come with baggage or shortcomings and you pretty much accept that, an inexperienced owner who knows nothing about basketball, and  failed to appreciate the enormity of what he was being asked to sign off onand a much more experienced GM who was wily enough to leverage his personal relationship with that other GM to both sucker him into the trade and -amazingly-  talk him into keeping it secret to avoid the absolute feeding frenzy which would have ensured if Doncic was available on the open market.

Or to put it more succinctly. Nico is an idiot and Pelinka saw him coming. || >T his is what the Lakers are up against and I suspect how they were able to hold back assets in the deal. It has already been reported that they asked to speak to Luka about signing an extension before the trade and were denied permission . . . .  The Mavs should have extracted more value from the Lakers (I think a trade of AD + Reaves for Luka would have been accurate pricing) but certainly not AD + Reaves + Christie + both picks and all possible swaps like I’ve seen others propose.

Yeah I think that's what people miss - even a great player, there's only so much that a team is going to pay for what just a season and a half rental of a guy who hadn't played in 2 months. It was similar to why Toronto got such a good deal for Kawhi Leonard. In both cases the guy immediately got healthy after going to his new team, but that wasn't a certainty when the trade was made || Bro is expecting Luka to come out with a six pack… that’s not ever going to even be Luka.. Dallas main problem with Luka is he was skipping out of summer camp, he was always in shape just couldn’t find a rhythm I believe it was because he didn’t attend summer camp/pre game etc.. || I'll also throw out that the Luka trade made so many of Nico's prior moves retroactively worse. Like, if you agree to a pick swap when everyone in your rotation is going to be 30, then oh well. You're expecting to be, at worst, trading a late 1st for a later 1st. We've got pick swaps waiting to go off when just about everyone in the rotation is going to be retired now. || It’s crazy you’re blaming AD’s transition defense like LeBron isn’t the one trying to get him to sit corner and stretch the floor. Also like LeBron and the wings aren’t supposed to be the transition defenders. 

This is why Jordan’s Bulls were so elite. Him and Pippen took away transition opportunities and forced you to play half court basketball. This is why the Spurs were elite in 2013+ Kawhi and Danny Green dominated the transition defense forcing everyone to play half court basketball. This is also why the Celtics just won a championship… Brown and Tatum are taking away all the easy transition baskets, forcing guys to play half court ball… but on the Lakers it’s Davis fault for not getting back meanwhile LeBron (&Luka) are 2 of the slowest defensive players in the league. || This trade have 0 basketball schematics involved in it. 

It's a decision forced by the top dogs who we don't know about for money reasons.

This is a win for the league cause luka on the most sellable franchise in the lakers. Mavs ownership want mavs in las vegas and this is also a win for nba front office. Etc2.

If mavs FO announced that luka wanted out. They could've gotten atleast 7 first round offers from atleast 5 teams. mavs front office don't even need to ask cause great offers will be abundant. Instead they specifically wanted the trade to be with the lakers. || I don't think Lebron is 2 tiers above JJJ lol. JJJ is probably gonna make all nba and Bron might not. They're in the same tier this year.

Anyways you're right Luka playing next to Bron means he's gonna have to grow up. No more bullshit ""Golden Boy"" leeway. It's time to win NOW.

Lukas relationship with Kyrie was a summertime boy-ish friendship built on love of the game and doing cool fun trickshots in practice.

Lukas relationship with Bron is going to be mentorship and learning how to win championships.

How is Luka going to react to Bron losing his shit at him?

How is Luka going to react to JJ Reddick yelling at him and coaching him hard?

This is Lukas opportunity to grow out of his boyhood and learn what it means to win championships.

He made it to the Finals- cool. So did Dwight Howard. Honestly Dwight and Luka have a lot in common when you look at their resumes and personalities.

Bron doesn't give a fuck that you went to the Finals once. That doesn't mean anything to him or the Lakers organizations. 

Mavs fans treated Luka like a God because he took them there once. Well, making the finals is the BARE MINIMUM now. Chips are the expectation and I'm not sure Luka is ready for that pressure. || I strongly disagree with there not being a better deal on the market but you make lots of good points about everything else. 


Good post op || ""The bad news is that we’re 7 years into his career and there hasn’t really been another star of his calibre I can think of that took this long to become “serious”""
Man has more all NBA 1st teams than Steph Curry. He had ONE serious enough team and took them to the finals. My tinfoil hat makes me want to ask whether you're paid by Nico and his goons.
Reality is he's one of one. Only Jokic is better and only Giannis can even talk because he won and he is that caliber of player. But his game WILL age worse than Lukas (and Jokic)
Selling him is like selling your kidney and being like ""but Ive gotten $2000 in return! I really like 2000!"" || It really is. Two teams with looming problems getting together and solving it in the most unconventional of ways. Doncic may have been on the less athletic side, but that wasn't the real reason. It was money. They couldn't give him the supermax and realistically field a championship winning team.They were caught in a situation where most teams would be forced to dole out an albatross contract, hoping everything else just falls in place at the right time. Lakers mortgaged their future, and AD was looking more and more like a player that you couldn't make the cornerstone once Bron (eventually) left. He can stay healthy, but he's still inconsistent. He's every bit as likey to give you a 13 point game as he is to give you a 30 point game. LA didn't want another decade of offering bad contracts as they search for a star big enough to be attracted by the big lights of Lakerland. Two bros doing each other a serious solid. Lol. || You can drive yourself crazy with this trade because it makes no basketball sense to make it but if you look at it through the lenses of the owner’s motivations it makes more sense. 

The Owners are not basketball people, their biggest venture is right now is trying turn the AAC into a casino complex. But with sports gambling illegal in Texas they have to look for a different route. Since the NBA already wants a team in Vegas, the plan would be to have the Mavericks relocated to Vegas. Now it’s hard to justify moving a team that is consistently making the playoffs/finals with Luka because the fan base is behind it and making good money. But if the team is bad and the fans are not engaged with the team or even hate the team outright, discussions would be had to move the team to a market that will financially support it. What’s one way to piss off an entire fan base? Trade away your homegrown generational talent with no warning in the middle of the night so there’s no chance to sway the decision in the court of public opinion. So the owners are financially incentivized for the team to be bad and its value to go in the tank because it serves their interests and makes it easier to move the team. Notice how I didn’t mention anything about basketball involved in the trade. Because it had nothing to do with it. || [removed] || It's not fascinating. The Lakers are the premier team in the NBA. Everyone either loves them or hates them. Personally I can't stand them. This was a money move by the league to draw eyeballs. That's it. One of the most famous players in the world on the most famous team. Adam Silver was 100% involved and he will take that to the grave. || Great post, but saying Bron is 2-3 tiers above Trip in 2025 when one is on his way out and the other is hitting his prime is laughable. 

The only way that is true is if we take in whole careers than obviously it's Bron. || I feel like this trade was done between the owners and they’re using the GM as the fall guy. || I don't think this trade will challenge any ""conventional wisdom"" based on the fact anyone with even a bit of sense thinks it's the dumbest trade in sports history. || This trade was 100% not about basketball and it's stupid to discuss it from that angle. This was some sort of under the table move. || I don't think it's all that fascinating. The Mavs traded a better player for a worse player who is also significantly older and with a bigger injury history.

They did so in the middle of the night at the trade deadline and bartered with just one team. And this is coming off a finals birth not even one calendar year apart.

When the GM making this trade has to laugh off the long term because he knows it's an outrageous trade, there's nothing that's defensible about it.

There is a reason we have never seen a trade like this ever in basically any sport.

I guess the fascinating part is from the side of the Lakers. Somehow they keep hoodwinking these teams into making trades like this. || Giannis for Luka was possible. 

There 100000% was better players and deals to be made. But when the Lakers GM gives you money under the table, you accept it. ",0.0,0.725,0.275,0.5849,0.056,0.796,0.148,0.9986,0.084,0.754,0.162,0.9998

Is there any past precedent?

Now, I don't expect the Mavs to do this due to Mavs ownership and leadership's most recent baffling comments disparaging Luka, and I personally would reverse it in a heartbeat, but I do wonder what the ramifications would be for both teams if the trade were to be reversed at this point.

It's not like AD and the Lakers tricked the Mavs bu hiding his injury history and not disclosing his current health etc, it was an accident and accidents happen. || The time to rescind a trade due to injury was during the physicals. If the Mavs' team doctors cleared AD and he then got injured while playing for them, what possible justification would they have for reversing the trade? || He cleared the physicals and got hurt on court and we all saw it.

It’s not like this is a 30 day money back guarantee. || Lol no. Just think of you can't ask for a refund when you are the one who broke the very brand new thing. Mavs are to be blamed. AD was sidelined and was projected by the Lakers for a return after the All-Star break. Am even surprised Mavs forced him to play earlier than expected. In this case 2 weeks earlier in his projected return timeframe || Its about if the Lakers hid anything, if upon his first medical, they found any issues that were unexpected/they thought they could not work with. This is my NAL-esque take atleast.

With Mark Williams, the situation is very different. The Hornets approached the Lakers and clearly tried to fleece us. Complete history, atleast of the foot/feet damage was not knows, and from what I have heard and understand, the Lakers medical team did tests that are not that typical, but which showed up glaring issues that even the Hornets did not know. On top of that, they played Mark heavy minutes, which may have worsened his issues. 

With Luka, we have been wondering the same thing, if the Mavs know something about his health that we don't. With regards to AD's health, I haven't heard any complaint and so would presume the Lakers provided all the relevant records, and the Mavs went ahead with the trade. I do not know where did you hear that his injury is worse than previously expected, so a source there would be nice. Also, it was up to Mavs to thoroughly conduct the physicals, plus there was a reason we were not playing AD AT ALL. 

We introduced Luka today, but keep in mind, we still only played him 24 minutes, even though he is younger. So your point here is very important, that maybe it was AD playing 30 minutes in his first game there. 

All in all, I am not sure if the trade can be rescinded at this point, given it seems to be, on PAPER, a legal trade. || No. They cleared him during his physical. If he happens to get injured while playing that is very unfortunate, but you can’t rescind the trade for that. There’s no valid justification for it. || Buncha nutball theories here. Davis has a well known history of injuries and being off the road. No secret there. That problem came to roost. Obviously not what they wanted. Luka's history is a bit better but last season he was the walking wounded playing sub par at the end of the season right up through the NBA finals. He was tired and had little nagging injuries. It was that way before. Calf injuries esp. recurring are more serious than commenters here are understanding. 4th time. The Mavs will get out of Davis far cheaper than they would with Luka. The Mavs do have a good team BTW. Still a dumb trade and we'll just have to see if the try to move the Mavs to Las Vegas. Then you have a legit argument. || I don’t think in NBA history has their been a trade that’s been rescind and that’s a unlikely scenario, I’m willing to be proven wrong cuz I’m not the best person regarding this topic but can a NBA team negotiate with the former about reversing the trade which would require mutual agreement and likely some contractual or legal maneuvering. The trade could be potentially voided if there was a misunderstanding or misrepresentation about the players health before the trade was finalized but AD was obviously hurt but AD brushed it off, saying it wasn’t serious before the trade took place  but it’s harder since the player played one game for their new team. The Mark Williams trade situation you mentioned might be different, as it likely involved specific contract clauses or medical considerations that allowed it to be rescinded. In this case with AD, I don't think it's realistic for the Mavs to reverse the trade without both teams agreeing to it, and it could have substantial ramifications in terms of relationships, future negotiations, and possibly the league's handling of the situation.

The ramifications would likely be financial (with salary cap implications), competitive (teams would have to adjust their rosters accordingly), and reputational, especially if one team is seen as backing out of a trade due to an injury. In the Mavs’ case, their leadership might face more criticism if such a reversal happened, and the Lakers could also face questions regarding their handling of the AD situation. || ""Accident.""

Because there’s no way he actually cleared a physical while already carrying an abdominal strain. || Regarding thinking his injury is worse than previously expected, I think it was a misunderstanding on my part - apologies!

At some point you have to point to incompetence and unprofessionalism from the Mavs || AD saying it ""was nothing serious"" is just him paying lip service because he doesn't want to be seen as weak from all the media pundits calling him Street Clothes. If the Mavs were a serious organization, they'd hold him out until he's fully recovered then slowly give him 20-25 MPG at 70% max speed when he returns || They traded for an injured player knowing he had just gotten injured. 
It was not an accident. Mavs knew they derailed the franchise to benefit NBA get a new face of league & keep LA relevant. Nothing about the trade was ""accidental"". || AD was already injured. Mavs knew they got damaged goods. NBA made the trade happen because they needed a new face and more help for LBJ, who has had more help than anyone || Unfortunately, I think they gave up ""serious organization"" rights when they gave up Luka. || An abdominal strain is certainly not as alarming or severe as a leg injury like a calf strain or knee injury that can potentially turn into an ACL/Achilles. Calling AD ""damaged goods"" while Luka was nursing a calf injury is hilarious. Maybe don't rush a player back from injury like the Lakers were planning to do?


>NBA made the trade happen because they needed a new face and more help for LBJ, who has had more help than anyone


I don't care about Lebron's legacy or his ""help"" roster. But the fact that you added that tidbit says a lot about your personal vendetta against him. Derangement syndrome on full display || The LeBron help angle shows you're just a hater and not looking at things objectively || Objectively? Fact is that AD was hurt before they got him.

Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-02-19,nbadiscussion,1iu0as7,Has Father Time finally caught LeBron James?,"LeBron James. Age 40. Season 22. No one in the game has had this kind of longevity. The only player who came close to this is Kareem. (Sidebar: I'll always find it curious how few people called Kareem the GOAT based on longevity when MJ was around, but now call LeBron the GOAT based on longevity... But I digress..).

Even at age 40, Bron is continuing to stuff the stat sheet. Let's look at the basic, raw box stats:

24.3 PPG (51.5/39.4/76.1)
7.7 RPG
9.0 APG

Age 40 and he's doing this? Looks incredible!

Now let's start looking beneath the surface. At efficiency and impact on the game.

Per DunksAndThrees:
OffEPM 2.5 (33rd in the NBA)
DefEPM -0.5 (300th in the NBA)
EPM 2.1 (54th in the NBA, basically tied with Austin Reaves)

Offense is chugging along, but the defense is gone. He's 40 and playing one side of the court to conserve energy. Makes sense, I guess.

Now for on court impact (per Cleaning the Glass):

Efficiency differential -8.1 (team points scored per 100 possessions minus team points allowed per 100 possessions). -8.1 puts LeBron in the 15th percentile in the NBA in efficiency differential and is the lowest of his entire career by far. In fact, he's NEVER been negative in this. Even as a rookie he was +1.9. And just last season LeBron was +8.3 and in the 88th percentile in the league.

Expected wins -19 (How many games would a team win in an 82 game season with this efficiency differential?). Once again, he's negative for the first time in his career. Just last season his expected wins was +20.

Points per 100 possessions: -3.5. Again, the first time he's been negative for points per 100 possessions in his entire career. -3.5 points/poss is the 28th percentile in the league.

Across the board, it looks like his efficiency and impact have fallen off a cliff, despite the solid raw box counting stats. Which brings us to last night...

Hornets vs Lakers: A Closer Look.

People are criticizing Luka. Especially a lot of Bron fans. And I get it. Luka's raw box score numbers looked terrible! And Bron's raw box score numbers looked pretty good. But let's dig a little deeper again and check impact.

Luka on: +17.1 Net. Luka off: -41.2 Net.
Bron on: -5 Net. Bron off: +10.6 Net.

Holy shit. The Lakers were +10.6 Net with Bron off the floor? And they were -41.2 Net with Luka off the floor, but +17.1 Net with Luka on it? Shocking.

In short, raw box scores can be very deceiving. You can score all the points you want, but if you do so inefficiently and/or play no defense, it won't matter much in terms of actually impacting winning games. It's been said that ""every team has a leading scorer, even the bad ones."" 

It's hard not to come away with the conclusion that Father Time has indeed caught up with LeBron, but it's not reflected in raw box scores (posted from Real and elsewhere). It's reflected in efficiency and impact. LeBron is getting his numbers, but at what cost to the team? 

The Lakers have a great record so far, but that was Anthony Davis around, who is one of the best defenders in the NBA. The perfect counterpart for a 40 year old LeBron who coasts on defense to save energy. Now LeBron is paired up with Luka, who, if anything, is a lot like him. A ball dominant, one way player. They have time to figure things out, but losses to the Jazz and Hornets could be a sign of things to come. The Lakers have had one of the easiest schedules in the league up until this point. They now have the 6th toughest remaining schedule strength. This could get ugly, quickly (we're already seeing people throwing Luka under the bus).",0,21,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iu0as7/has_father_time_finally_caught_lebron_james/,2025-02-20 09:54:38,"Father Time has slowed him down to a degree and we see that with LeBron not being able to do the hard carry through all the injuries and now trying to allow Luka to get back into playing shape while being comfortable with a new team. Things will come together as they get more reps and find that comfort level between LeBron, Luka, and the Lakers kind of find their way. Without AD the Lakers just went on a great run and are at worst an above average team still || For the first time in a long, long time LeBron has no pressure to win. I'm a Lakers fan, we're rocking a center rotation of Hayes and Len. We absolutely will not win anything with those 2 playing real minutes. Trading AD for Luka made us worse in the short-term but much, much better long-term.

I've seen a tonne of LeBron basketball. He's been in decline for a bit. He's 40 that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. I do think right now, the way he plays regular season basketball is hurting his team. I also don't think it really matters, for the reasons mentioned above. The real test will be his impact in meaningful games, based on what I saw at the Olympics I definitely think LeBron can be the #2 option on a very good basketball team. The Lakers have their eye on the future, so unfortunately we might have seen all the meaningful basketball were gonna get from LeBron. 10 finals appearances, a gazillion playoff games, he's given us more than we can ask. Time to just enjoy the end of the ride. || Use your eyes. Lebron is paired with the worse parts of the Lakers rotations. Charlotte hunted Luka to win the game. || > Offense is chugging along, but the defense is gone. He's 40 and playing one side of the court to conserve energy. Makes sense, I guess.

Old Kareem was that way too.  Seems like anyone at that age has either their offense or defense vanish, even if the other end stays at a high level.

For examples the other way, Tim Duncan and Karl Malone both were still great defenders in their final seasons, but their scoring ability had declined quite a bit. || Stats are very deceiving in the modern NBA. I think he should retire but he won't do that until after next season because Bronny is retiring that same year || LeBron can still play at the highest level possible and look like the best player in the world he just can’t do it all game anymore. The coasting on defense is most definitely helping mitigate his stamina and allowing him play defense and offense in the 4th when it really matters. I don’t really see him having an actual huge drop off but he will probably continue to slowly decline. I may get hate for this but I think with AD he would’ve been done in a year to two because bron was still having to run everything and AD doesn’t really control the offense. With Luka once he gets settled I can see lebron playing a lot more off ball and being a spot up shooter which should allow him to have more stamina for key moments. I also would think that this would extend how long he can and may want to play not having to put the entire team on his back every night. It’s also contingent on LA building a competent team around him and Luka where he can coast on defense and offense when needed. So yes I think Father Time has slowly started to catch up with him but it only really has changed how much of a game he can 100%. I still see him being a mid 20s and 7+ plus assist and rebound a night guy years down the line if he doesn’t have to carry the team like he has to do most do his career. || Anything to deflect the blame off the guy charlottes was hunting last night. || On the defensive end yes. On the offensive end not very much. He’s even a better 3pt shooter now than he ever was || While it’s obvious that this is the worst season LeBron has played in his career and his defense is probably the worst it’s ever been, I think these advanced stats actually do a worse job of telling the story than traditional box scores do. The Lakers currently have an inefficient, out of shape co-star that is still building chemistry and a below average bench. LeBron currently leads the lakers in minutes per game and according to nbarotations.info, usually takes the floor again without Reaves and Rui, who provide quality defense and open up the floor for different offensive scenarios. Comparing efficiency and +/- is useful when looking at an individual team and determining rotations, but you lose a lot of context when you compare between teams. To me, looking at these numbers knowing LeBron plays significant minutes with lesser talent on the floor shows that the team feels LeBron offers enough upside to give the other players a rest. If LeBron only played with the best lineups, his numbers would be better. You can say LeBron no longer “elevates” his teammates or makes up for a bad roster like he used to, but at the end of the day looking at a guy comparing these numbers for a guy who takes the court with Christian Koloko and Shake Milton is going to have worse numbers by default than say, a guy who is on a team like the Knicks who keep their rotations much tighter. || And he just had another 40 point game after this last night lmao. If anything he’s somehow better than his age 39 season? || I'm late to this discussion but there is another layer to this.   On pbpstats Lebron's 3 point shooting luck when on and off the court is quite unlucky.  When Lebron is on the court, his teammates even on open possessions have forgotten how to shoot.  On the court, they go nuclear from 3.  Swings like this happen all time.  SGA's season is getting juiced even more than it should be by 3 point shooting luck when he is on and off the court in the reverse direction.  Lebron has benefitted from these swings at various times in his career, but this isn't the first time it has happened, but it is the most dramatic example.  In 2018 he almost had a negative on/off.  EPM and DRtg capture this and make his defense look a lot worse than it actually is in this particular season.  It has started to normalize though. || All this advanced stats go out of the window if you watch games but why do that right, no seriours person will watch the last Lakers game and say that Luka was better than LBJ.

In short advanced stats can be deceiving as well if you are using them to further our own agenda and throw context out of the window.

Lakers started they best run when they went small and AD was out.

But not much is expected of a dude who is a Warriors fan and spends his time on reddit hating on LeBron (in order to prop Curry ) and using kindergarten talking points.

And the most hilarious is trying to mask it as thoughful discussion in this sub.

One other thing that is funny is that since Lebron took a week off he has been balling and pushing his team into the standings. || It's a great analysis by OP. LeBron is slowing down. A lot of turnovers. Passing like crap. Little to no defense. Father Time is undefeated. What happens next is nagging small injuries pile up or a devastating Achilles or knee injury occurs or both.

Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-02-19,nbadiscussion,1itgw75,Looking back at last season --how did injured one legged Luka and the Mavs run through 3 very solid western conference teams to get to the finals?,"I remember Luka visibly limping and grimacing in almost every game of round 1.  Yet they went on to beat --

1. Round 1 --the clippers with 3 future hall of famers and  amore talented team on both ends on paper
2. Round 2 --The young and very talented and healthier OKC thunder.

WCF --- beat the Wolves who looked extremely good beating Jokic and the former champs in the round right before. In fact they made beating the wolves look relatively easily.

Of course it wasnt just Luka he had a good side kick in Kyrie and some solid defensive role players, but still those teams they beat were more talented and much healthier AND favored in all 3 rounds.

What in the heck happened there? I just remembered it always looked like Luka was trying way harder than the stars on the other teams especially the clippers. ON A BAD LEG. and of course just hitting a ton of shots that sometimes were  contested and sometimes not contested nearly enough

Did it look that way to anyone else?

Also Luka and Kyrie are known for being below average defenders, especially an injured Luka. It semed like the guards on the other teams didnt put in the effort to exploit this nearly enough. An injured Luka seemed more agressive than healthy guards on the other teams.

What really happened?",665,218,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1itgw75/looking_back_at_last_season_how_did_injured_one/,2025-02-19 16:17:54,"The Mavs also were a matchup nightmare for us. A big part of what made us special was the ability to just put endless amounts of athletic and great perimeter defenders on guys and funnel them into Rudy. Luka was able to bully McDaniels and the Mavs offense got whatever they wanted because we could not guard him.

Also the Wolves made some bad offensive plans with McDaniels not getting involved into actions and thus letting Luka chill in the corner on defense instead of actually working. KAT was also tragic and could not make a shot to save his life. || In the Thunder’s case, he got healthier as the series went on + PJ Washington’s excellent series made up for Luka’s poor production early in that series. || The Mavericks played great team defense since the trade deadline last year, with PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford added to Dereck Lively and Derrick Jones Jr., etc. They were one of the league's top defenses after that.

Regardless of what people think, it is possible to build an elite defense around Luka and Kyrie, as we saw. It was effective in the playoffs. Even against the Celtics somewhat, as the Celtics did not have a high offensive rating in that series. 

The Celtics were a matchup nightmare, though, on both ends. The Mavs team defense was based on perimeter guys funneling ballhandlers into help in the paint. The Celtics are/were a uniquely effective 5-out spacing team. OKC plays that style too, but Dallas was able to help off Chet Holmgren and recover because he's not as dangerous a shooter as Porzingis. Dallas was able to help off some other OKC guys and not pay too bad a price for it. 

Dallas couldn't find a good balance between sticking to shooters and helping Luka on the back line, but even then, they held Boston to a decent rating. The problem was, on the other end, Boston's defense threw a wrench in the Mavs offense to an even greater degree.

The Mavs favored a pick and roll heavy offense, using plays like double drag screens to free up their big men to roll hard to the basket.

The Celtics put Jayson Tatum on Dereck Lively and were switching everything, so putting Lively in a screen action just resulted in Tatum on Luka. Luka did score on Tatum sometimes, but they were not really able to exploit the switches. Dereck Lively was not able to punish smaller players for defending him. 

I think the Celtics weakness would have been a center with a deep scoring bag, but Lively for all his strengths is not that.

I'm not sure what the Mavericks could have done to adjust their offense, but either way, they didn't do a lot to improve it. 

Meanwhile, Kyrie just didn't do anything. For whatever reason he was not making shots that he had been making in the previous rounds. 

So in short, I think the Mavericks got to the finals because they had an elite defense and two elite shot creators, and they lost in the finals because the Celtics were a bad matchup, Luka was banged up, Kyrie for whatever reason didn't do anything, and they had no answers. || Regarding the wolves, they looked gassed after beating the nuggets. Ant even said he needed to improve his conditioning for future deep playoff runs. || We finally had the perfect team built around Luka. People forget he took an Island of Misfit Toys to the WCF in 2022 without a Kyrie. Frankly Luka is just that dude. He's the 2nd highest playoff scorer in NBA history, behind only Jordan. 

DJJ, Lively and Washington are all great defenders, and we specifically played our defense so the far corner defender sat at the edge of the paint to play help defense, which allowed Lively to float out of the paint if he needed to. (Plus Luka and Kyrie aren't near as bad defenders as people like to claim, they are far from good, but they aren't major liabilities) || [removed] || Pretty sure the Mavs won 3/4 games against  Minnesota were extremely close so I wouldn’t say they made it look easy. || It took everything the Wolves had to beat the Nuggets, they were mentally and physically exhausted when they faced the Mavs after a 7 game rock fight. If the Wolves had met the Mavs in round 1 or 2 Minny wins in 6. || Good defense. Even with Luka being lazy, they had great rim protection and Kyrie put his whole energy on defense. And clutch plays from Luka and Kyrie.
They had lot of close wins.
Celtics were different cause they could play 5 out offense and every one of those players could shoot and drive.
And even in the finals they had 2 close losses that could've gone either way. A healthier Luka could've been the difference on those finals. || The Mavericks mid-season addition provided significant interior defense and size. It turned their season around and was a big factor come the playoffs because it shored up defensive deficinies from the perimeter players.

You will notice a trend- all the western teams the Mavs beat were not elite 3 point shooting teams. 

Against the Clippers-

Kawhi did not play. The games he did play he was at 30%. Couldn't move, couldn't jump.

Paul George was really bad. He IS really bad. He was always that way for most of his Clippers tenure. A low-impact player who couldn't take over a game but demanded a max. He couldn't beat his man 1v1 anymore, couldn't finish, tried to make stupid dunks over the Dallas bigs. Low IQ all around, zero impact. 

James Harden is what you get. A good point guard but he's lost a step. So with basically only Harden able to create anything and PG being ass, they didn't have the firepower to stretch the Dallas defense out or the ability to finish over their bigs.


Against the Thunder - Same deal. Shai was great, but outside of that, the Thunder were not good enough shooters. While they shot at a very high efficiency, they did not shoot a high volume of 3s. The Dallas defense couldn't be spread out enough by spacing. This is why this season the Thunder started the season shooting many many more 3s and started off hot. They knew that to get through the Mavericks rim protection they needed to shoot more 3s.

Against the Wolves - Again not a great 3 point shooting team. While Kat and Ant were capable shooters, Rudy Gobert still crowded the paint. With Kat missing shots they couldn't score well enough. 

And then you face the Celtics - shoot a lot of 3s, pass well, make a lot of 3s. Every player capable of attacking, penetrating, and passing. The Celtics offense made the Dallas double large lineup essentially a nonfactor. If they tried to protect the rim, they could pass to shooter. If they tried to go small, they'd just beat Luka off the dribble and get what they want at the rim. The only way the Mavericks would have a chance to win is if Luka were healthy, engaged on defense, and didn't cry to refs.

As for these teams' defense- Luka is just too good at basketball. Not that complicated. Doesn't matter what kind of scheme or what quality of perimeter or interior defense, Luka will break it down, even when he's not healthy. He'll get what he want in isolation or he'll get what he wants off the PnR. The issue arises when his lack of defense bleeds offense that ends up more efficient than his. And that's what the Celtics did. Luka could score on Boston, and maybe he's a little bit less efficient per possession when Celtics were adamant about playing him 1 on 1, but in the end their offense was too much for the Dallas defense. 

So the outcomes of these playoffs was about matchups. Luka is too good of an offensive player, it was whether the Mavericks defense could keep the team competitive. Double big lineups were very effective against teams that lacked supreme 3 point shooting, but failed against the team that did have it. Most likely if the Thunder or maybe even Wolves were in the Finals, the Finals could have been more competitive because they were more well-rounded defensive teams. || The clippers didn’t have kawhi. He did technically play but that wasn’t kawhi. PG had declined. Harden isn’t the mvp guy from 2018. 

The thunder had everybody but Shai go ice cold. Giddey was an offensive liability. Chet could not rebound to save his life. Mavs role players stepped up and outperformed the thunder role players big time. Another thing is that the thunder team was young and had very little playoff experience. All teams need some guys that know what they are doing once they get deeper into the playoffs. 

The wolves were a special case. A lot of the games could have easily swung towards them. Lots of lucky officiating, tough shots, and cold streaks knocked them out. The Mavs were coached better and they just had a better plan to handle their defense. || Kawhi was injured on the Clips and OKC was an inexperienced team that doesn’t have playoff lumps. Young teams always do poorly in the playoffs.
Wolves were kind of a mess. Finch is not a great playoffs coach. || From a physical profile, Luka is very unorthodox for the NBA.  He's a real big dude, both in height and mass, while also being very skilled handling the ball.  This creates many potential mismatches on the court for many defending teams.  If you have an extremely athletic defender that's a bit undersized (or even average sized), Luka knows how to use his size to bully them and force help to come.  If you have an extremely large and strong, but slow-footed defender, Luka is skilled enough to get past them and force help.  And if you have two or more of these types of guys on the court at the same time against Doncic, the Mavs would be able to do enough screening actions to force one of the mismatches onto Doncic, and from there they could go to town.

What an opposing team needed to defend Doncic (at least as well as can be done), is a number of players capable of defending power forward sized players at the perimeter.  That's what happened when they ran into the Celtics and they made Luka work hard for his points.  They had Tatum and Brown as primary defenders, and Holiday, Horford, and even for brief stretches Hauser could not be embarrassed on ball.

Minnesota didn't really have any of the big wing defenders or extremely strong guards that are necessary to be a good match-up on ball for Luka, so Luka was able to eat in the series. || The Mavs had a great team and defense around him. He led the offense but they were even great with kyrie out there without him. 

Kyrie was amazing in round one and did great at non scoring things in round two. DJJ and Washington took turns having good offensive games and were elite on D. Their centers were amazing in their roles. 

The clippers didn’t have Kawhi and the mavs had more talent by the playoffs. 

Okc was a close series and the Mavs were able to rotate and slow their offense down. I don’t think OKC was a way more talented team either

Luka wasn’t even as good as he usually is in those two series and he didn’t really carry them. He did look like himself vs the Wolves and was unstoppable. I thought the wolves would be a bad matchup and the Mavs had the answers cause of Luka || Kawhi was injured lol, DAL doesn't get out the 1st round again.

That young OKC team is never coming back again.

And Gobert's 1st seed Jazz had choked in previous years to a Kawhi-less Clippers & PG lol. 

They were the 5th seed & Luka got hunted in the Finals which is now what every team is doing. || The role players on the mavs had maybe one of the best combined performances I’ve ever seen || Are you serious about the clippers? Kawhi only played 2 games harden and PG are both really old || Because people always tend to overstate Lukas injury. No player on 1 leg can dominate multiple series. Nope. Sorry. Not buying it. || I can only confidently speak for the OKC series, where a banged up Luka wasn't the best player in the series. 

But doubling Luka allowed Mavs spot up shooters to hit wide open shots (often from the corners). PJ Washingtons 3pt% went up from 32% on 5.6 attempts per game in the regular season to 47% on 8 attempts against OKC. 

Lively and Gafford also caused problems for our small ball line up, from regular pick n roll situations from both Luka and Kyrie. 

To put into context that series as an OKC fan - OKC didn't go out in hunt for a Luka stopper in the off season. They went out and got a big man to offer more physicality on defense. While Chet was a net positive in that series, with him off the floor, the Mavs front court feasted. || Luka was the best player on the court every series and did a hard carry job. His role players and teammates stepped up. Some guys like J Will and Ant disappointed who were in his way. Whole team punched above their weight and Luka was fantastic. || Clippers hall of famers were/are in the twilight of their careers. 

Wolves were gassed after a supe physical series against the nuggets. 

Thunder were incredibly young and very inexperienced, being their first trip. No one expected them to go all the way.

That mavs team was well constructed. Their dual rim running bigs were a massive part of their game plan and helped to maintain a physical presence on the court at all times. PJ Washington was incredible in multiple ways. I think people severely under rate him. Defensively they had great players at nearly every position outside of Luka and Kyrie. || Luka magic + offensive scheme.

I’m more interested in others takes though, as mine are simplistic. The Clippers could’ve won that one with Kawhi as usual.

By the OKC series it looked trivial, just a reopening knee wound. || Mostly I remember no answer for Luka and a ton of lob dunks from Luka to lively || Luka was too out of shape for teams to guard.

Pretty simple, really. He was too fat for The Clippers to guard.

There's a channel on YouTube that used to visit a bunch of different team equipment managers. Shoe-wise, I think it depends on relationships between players and shoe companies (ie who sponsors a player). For sponsored players, they may know the kinds of shoes they like and make sure they send those, plus others to test out. Additionally, I think the companies send a bunch of shoes to teams for non sponsored players to pick from. And non sponsored players might be able to make requests, too (I don't know for sure though). At the end of the year, players have a bunch of shoes left over that they have shipped to their homes.


As with everything, it's all pretty logistically organized and streamlined so players don't need to think too much, except for what they have at home to support their job (ie the decision to have a personal chef, in-home gym, etc). Once they make decisions, there are many resources available from the team, the league, and good agents, to help them get things done.


Players and staff also have group chats which fills several purposes, but specifically when it comes to logistics, helps them organize get togethers (ie on Old Man and the Three, they had Jaren Jackson and Desmond Bane on, and they were asked a question about Steven Adams, and one of the stories was of a get together at assistant coach's house Darko (now HC at Toronto) where his gf cooked up a meal for Adams before the get together where he had several more chicken breasts. That's the sort of stuff that group chats would facilitate.


What was most interesting to me when I was first interested in team logistics, was all the stuff players travel with on the road. It isn't just what the social media shows with one carryon and a backpack. They carry PS4s; personal massage kits and cryo kits for their legs or arms or whatever, even torsos; podcasting gear; all sorts of stuff to make their lives easier and more comfortable on the road.


Equipment staff usually takes care of a ton of things and have to do so at the visiting arena a certain fixed time before the team arrives, so often they go straight to the arena upon landing, and there is a logistics side there to how many copies of different jerseys and equipment to bring depending on how long the trip is, I think including sewing (or maybe the home team lets them use their sewing as a reciprocated courtesy), in case of a new player that arrives midway during a road trip. They have to be prepared for every. Thing. And that brings up reciprocated services and hospitality by all home teams, where they let visiting teams, and players away from their teams, use their weight rooms, and I know the team I root for lets other players come by just whenever (within reason), especially if someone is rehabbing but coming through town for whatever reason, and wants to use the training facilities, the team tries to accommodate them. Probably not medical staff, but just like the ice tubs after a weight room or shooting round. And I suspect that is not uncommon. Just need to communicate with the team ahead of time. || Recommended videos/channels to learn more about the logistics would be Royal Key/Coiski Media they have a lot of vlogs on touring the facilities with operation and equipment managers of professional sports and college teams. They also have vlogs on nutrition/wellness executives on how they prepare food for teams especially for college teams. Some NBA team vlogs have specific videos on Game Day prep with the equipment operations teams from ingress and egress of games and this shows how spoiled NBA teams are where these dudes behind the scenes barely sleep especially on those back-to-backs and late flights. There are also vlogs on team security staff of the Milwaukee Bucks making sure that things don't escalate on-court and coordinating with the logistics/operations teams on team security when moving in and out of cities.

Most of the equipment operation guys started out as ball-boys and eventually move up or were Assistants and the job is taxing one, given how big egos are in a pro sports team. They would need to know literally hundreds of items from socks, shirts, compression (pants, sleeves, tops, shirts, hybrids where one sleeve is longer), braces, shorts, multiple-colored jerseys, headbands, practice shirts, shorts, pants, tank tops, and A LOT of SHOES). 

When the NBA changed their rules of allowing teams/players to wear shoes that are not limited to primarily being their team's colorways, this also added another dynamic layer of logistics for them since they would need to consider the number of pairs each player has. Adding to the issue would be teams with multiple signature athletes, coordinating with their brands for specific colorways/releases ex. Christmas Day, MLK day, All-Star, Playoffs and etc. Normally a lot of players who aren't necessarily signed to a brand ex. Nike can easily request through the equipment team for specific customizations if they have bigger sizes beyond 16 or 17 or they would most likely have brand reps who would offer teams discounts on shoes/colorways that were mostly evident prior to the NBA attire/fashion rule change where shoes like Hyperdunks would be in team colors. 

They would also need to have multiple back-ups, of each item, and they must prepare and collect dirty gear and get them clean while the team is travelling, and this requires a lot of coordination with the other team's opponent if they are in the road and they assist each other with laundry and getting their gear in place in the arena or even practice facilities.

For team operations outside of the equipment, they definitely have internal team roles who handle the back-office/internal activities that a team does. It could range from sales/marketing, analytics, operations (including equipment managers), HR, administrative, finance and accounting, PR, communications which you would normally see in a typical corporate office and these roles are mostly non-basketball related. 

Hope this helps since I'm also a big fan of the NBA beyond the basketball aspects! || I was a security guard a few years ago for MLSE and Masai Ujiri would often leave his office door open so I would have to go in and close it but he had business cards with a common email on it, pictures of his family on his desk and a parking space with his name. Downstairs of his office is the leafs office, and around draft time they had a war room with players they wanted just written on a white board and after the draft they used the war room to discuss free agents they wanted to sign and what they expected them to get and what they were willing to pay for the free agents. It's pretty common that it runs just like a regular office. Fridges, lunch rooms, merch. But the raptors don't really have their own parking lot, they have Biometrics to get into locker rooms and practice court on the top floor of the Scotiabank arena. If the player doesn't have their ID card, then they have to go through a different entrance. I remember being at a door on an off day and 3 raptors walked in and very very politely asked if they can go to the gym upstairs and work out. I didn't recognise them because they weren't starters or anything n were in street clothes and I was like ""naw that's just for players"", and they told me their names and the guard I was with said ""y'all play for the raptors?"" And they laughed and politely said yeah we play for the raptors. Looked at their ID and called it in and they got an escort upstairs. Their locker rooms are pretty small to be fair, leafs one is cool but basic for it being a billion dollar franchise. Media room is just an open space with a drinks fridge and food set out.

And also, this has nothing to do with anything but when I worked there it was 2 or 3 years after the championship and there was NOT A SINGLE picture of kawhi Leonard in the entire arena. Pictures of the parade, no Kawhi, draft picks, no Kawhi, random players, no Kawhi. And they meet every year and discuss the pictures in the arena so it's a conscious decision to not put Kawhi in the building. || I was curious about logistics around a player being traded and found this interesting article ok group chats in the NBA

Not really you’re question but still may intrigue you. || yeah I've always wondered how they specifically get paid. Are dudes just getting like 1 million direct deposited every two weeks? I mean I guess so but it just feels so crazy that's how it would be done. || If you’re interests exceed just the game of basketball and include pretty much pro sports as a whole, David Samson is a former GM and president of OPs for the Malrins. Sure it’s MLB but he has a podcast and he often goes on other pods like Lebatard Show to discuss the ins and outs of running a sports team. From how people learn they are traded and report to their new team, to how a team gets an arena approved and funded. It’s called Nothing Personal. || I love this question because I'm fascinated by it as well. In fact, during my (failed) degree in International Business Studies I worked out a case-study with a local football (soccer) club. This was the early 2000s in the Netherlands, but it is so much more complex than you'd imagine.

For example in football, the team manager is not the 'coach' (the man they call manager in football), it's a dedicated role and they are often supported by an assistant. Their role is to plan all logistics. Getting a football team with 30 people from one city to the other in the Netherlands is relatively easy, you hop on a bus and drive. But you also need all the kit, all the documentation, the hotel sorting, the fitness suite sorting, physio rooms etc. etc. They had check-lists for everything and these were constantly changed to meet emerging requirements, like a player needing sports tape or changing dietary requirements.

Between clubs, things are arranged with 'riders' like music acts and actors do as well, the hosting club describes what facilities will be available to the visiting team. But it's on a 'like for like' basis. If the team you are visiting is only providing you with bare necessities... well, then you only provide them with that when they return, right? There's a lot of unspoken rules and gentleman's agreements involved. 

Hotels tend to be booked as soon as the schedule is known and each club has good contacts with particular hotels/chains. Back then the team I studied had an agreement with Van der Valk hotels, a big chain in the Netherlands. They had just got quite far into the cup and were playing a team at the other side of the country, but all hotels were fully booked due to another major event in the area. So Van der Valk arranged a bunch of caravans on a nearby camping for the team to stay in. Apparently it wasn't very comfortable because they lost that game 3-1.

Training/exercise is run by the coaches/actual manager. But again, not in the way you'd necessarily expect. Every month they decide on the 'agenda' in a big meeting with the captain of the team, the physios/sports scientists. But I learned that it is different for each manager. Some prefer lots of team focussed training and a lot of team-wide stamina/cardio training, others draw up seperate schedules for sections of the team (defenders, attackers, midfielders etc.) and adapted for each player's individual needs. It is super intricate and I can only imagine that in the last 20 years that has only become more complicated. Add in that in the NBA the players have a huge say, many have their own personal trainers/chefs etc. So I think it's probably quite different in the NBA in that sense. 

Oh, before I forget, discipline was a huge eye-opener for me as well. The team agree fines at the start of the season, being late, swearing, smoking and drinking (a player told me a brilliant anecdote of being out in the city after a big win with a couple of others, they were drinking and pretty drunk on the main square, partying with fans, when the manager and assistant coach spotted them. Big no no! Cost them €1300 each, which was a week's wages at the time! Funniest thing: The manager was completely blottoed himself) but it's actually the team-captain that is in charge of that. He collects the money and depending on how much there is at the end of the season either organises a massive party, donates to a charity of his choice or a combination of the two. || That's a very interesting topic for me. Like, does LeBron have a company phone? Does he need to go through mandatory courses so he doesn't click on a phishing email and get hacked? || So LeBron exchanges emails, text messages, phone calls, Teams messages, in-person meetings, virtual meetings, and hand written post it notes with JJ. || I’d love to see the spreadsheets equipment managers have to track the extra gear each player wears. Arm bands. Wrist bands. Headbands. Shooting sleeves. Leggings. One-leg leggings. Knee pads. Mouth guards. The list goes on and on. || This is super helpful. I’ll check out those videos. Thanks. || That was interesting. It’s funny to read an article from 2019 that talks about group chats like they are some great advancement in technology. My favorite was the mention of players forming group chats to discuss teaming up in free agency with the implication it’s scandalous. || They only get paid during the season so it’s their annual salary divided by the number of payments in a season. But yes, otherwise it’s just a normal payroll. || It would make sense to me have a couple “player relationship” managers that just say “hey plane leaves at 6p lmk if you need a car or you’ll be driving, trip is 8 days” 

But at lebrons level, his assistant probably deals with everything || Yes. And the staff, the trainers, the medical team.

When I get tickets to go watch games, my wife's cousin texts the fan relations person directly.

Well, LeBron may not... But my wife's cousin makes $20M+, and he does. || I love the idea of LeBron losing access to his Cavalier’s email account when he left the team. || In the NBA they typically place ticket holds for every game. Players usually buy from that at a discounted rate

The cool thing is that they also have an internal bidding system for tickets for anyone associated and working with the league. So say you want to catch the Bulls vs Hornets in Chicago. Instead of buying a ticket, you can place a bid for a ticket and say I only want to pay $30 for it. They’ll go down the list of bids and give out whatever is left from their allotment to the highest bidders

Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-02-22,nbadiscussion,1iviucw,A statistical breakdown of the Jimmy Butler Warriors,"We are 5 games into the Jimmy Butler Warriors Era. Let's take a look at these early returns from this small sample of games.

The Warriors are 4-1. They are blessed with a relatively weak remaining schedule strength (22nd toughest remaining). 

120.2 OffRtg (≈2nd currently in NBA) 
107.8 DefRtg (≈2nd currently in NBA) 
12.4 NetRtg (≈2nd currently in NBA)

DunksAndThrees (EPM): 7th Net, 6th@Full-Strength (aka when Kuminga comes back).

How's Steph doing now that he has a Butler? 28.8ppg/5.4ast/4.2 reb on 47/40/84 splits.

Over this 5 game span he's at 6th OffRtg & 8th NetRtg in the NBA. Wow.

Per DunksAndThrees Steph is currently 4th in OffEPM and 12th in EPM on the season.

Seems like the game is opening up for Steph with Jimmy around. Here's some proof. Check out Steph's shot diet from 3.

Before: Open 3s: 33.4% frequency. Wide Open 3s: 15.9% freq. 49% Open or Wide Open 3s.

w/ Jimmy: Open 3s: 39.8% freq. Wide Open 3s: 18.1% freq. 58% 3s Open or Wide Open 3s.

~10% better! The Chef is cooking and The Butler is serving.

Given the Warriors relatively weak remaining schedule strength (22nd) and the fact that the Lakers, Nuggets, Grizzlies, Clippers, Suns, and Kings are all in the Top 10 in remaining schedule strength, the 6th seed, while tough to get to, is a real possibility. They will just have to keep up this momentum and take advantage of their weak remaining schedule strength.

Here's a fun fact from my deep dive on Post All-Star Break teams. Well, fun if you're not a Lakers fan. Per DunksAndThrees, The Lakers only have 10 games with ≥ 55% win probability for the rest of the season. They really could fall into the Play-In if they don't figure things out quickly enough.

Going 2-2 against the Jazz (2x), Hornets, and Blazers could be a sign of future danger for them. They seem to be built to win NEXT season when they can properly retool around Luka, as opposed to this season when they're relying on Jaxson Hayes to replace Anthony Davis defensively.

Concluding thoughts: it's only 5 games, but so far Jimmy has transformed the Warriors. The analytics are off the charts. Several other Western Conference teams now have some of the toughest remaining schedule strengths in the NBA. The 6th seed is a real possibility. And keep in mind that even before Jimmy showed up... The Warriors actually have a pretty good record against the best teams in the West. Does OKC or MEM or HOU or MIN want to deal with the Jimmy Butler Dubs in a Playoffs series? Could be dangerous.

Here's the Warriors record against Western Conference teams before Jimmy:
2-1 vs OKC; 2-1 vs MEM; 3-1 vs HOU; 3-1 vs MIN; 0-1 vs DEN; 0-3 vs LAL (but no AD now, different team); 0-3 vs LAC (Achilles heel?).

Any rational person would be hard-pressed to believe the Warriors are somehow going to be worse against these same teams with Jimmy Butler around. 

The Warriors really could make noise if they get the right matchup. Something special could be happening in the Bay. A ring is a long-shot, obviously, but if things break the right way, Bradley Beal deserves a statue outside of Chase Center. Also, shout out Pat Riley.",449,147,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iviucw/a_statistical_breakdown_of_the_jimmy_butler/,2025-02-22 08:34:27,"This video from a few days ago is a nice look at how he fits with the Warriors.  They walk through some plays: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh4w7o8yOPo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh4w7o8yOPo)

The TLDR is that Jimmy's basketball IQ is off the charts.  He's easily one of the best in the game at using cuts and screens and a variety of actions off of those to create for himself and his teammates.  As I watched the video I was struck by the fact that Jimmy's offensive game is the polar opposite of Luka's.  Jimmy is a floor-runner in transition while Luka creates the break with long outlets.  Luka does his best work creating on the ball while Jimmy does his best work creating off the ball.  Jimmy is elite at screening and cutting while Luka is better off ball spacing the floor.  Isn't it interesting that we can have two so incredibly impactful players on offense and they both play in almost opposite ways-- what a game!  It got me thinking that I should show some Jimmy and Luka clips to my team to emphasize that there are many ways to be successful on offense. || A checked in, engaged Jimmy could benefit almost any team. With his playoff energy, they will be tough to beat. He is fully healthy after skating most of the year, plus time off for the suspensions.
Good pickup for the GSW || The Warriors just keep on finding ways to look terrifying. I mean, I think we all thought after Klay, they were just going to do a victory lap of mediocrity as Steph and Dray rode off into the sunset of their careers. And then this happens. I don't know if they have the firepower to play with the big boys because this team is SMALL, but that poises them well to make it deep in a Western Conference that is incredibly talented, but lacks consistent size across the conference. If they run into Denver, they are probably cooked, but if they can find a way to path through Houston, OKC, and find a way to run Edey off the floor in Memphis, there is a way for them to kinda ignore that deficiency. || Obligatory Lakers fan comment to clear up some misinformation.

You're using a 5 game sample size to draw conclusions about the Warriors. Then you use a 4 game sample that includes two games bookending the all star break to suggest the Lakers are in trouble. 

Why don't you use a 10 game sample, (starting the game after AD got injured and then later traded without playing again) where the Lakers are 7-3? That 10 game sample would show that the Lakers are 4th in defensive rating and 6th in net rating during that span. 

And that's without adding a fully healthy and conditioned Luka to the team. He's only played in 3 of those games and is clearly not himself after sitting out two months with a lower limb injury. This is Luka Doncic, the top 5 NBA player I'm referencing. 

I think the Lakers will be just fine. || The whole paragraph in the middle about the lakers was kinda weird. Good on the warriors though and especially on Jimmy. || Yeah let’s extrapolate from a 4 game sample with the all star brake in between and pretend the previous 4 months of ball didn’t happen. Warriors fans always out themselves as box score watchers. || It's pretty wild to me that people actually thought he wouldn't be an impactful addition. Sure he had injuries last year and he played pretty checked out so far this season but that was the deal. He was checked out.

He's 35 but he's in excellent shape and we've seen for years now what a motivated Jimmy giving his all can do. || With Kuminga due back from injury any day now and Moody + Podz clicking in their new roles since the trade, the Warriors really do look different.
Throw in Quinton Post as an out-of-nowhere serviceable stretch 5, and things get very interesting.

Didn't realise the strength of their schedule (or lack thereof) to close out the season was so positive for them and so bad for their top-6 spot competitors.  Let's see if this Butler transform keeps up, or if it falters due to injuries, lack of regular season fight or internal bickering (all things that can be historically attributable to Jimmy Butler and/or the Warriors in general). || In those 5 games the warriors played the Bucks without Giannis, the Rockets without Van Vleet and with Jaylen green returning form injury in limited minutes, Mavs without AD, a cratering Sacramento teams that just traded their biggest star and Chicago.

Not really a good sample is it? I’m sure if Lakers only played absolute garbage teams every week the first seed. || Jimmy can elevate to a top 5 or 3 guys in the playoffs, as can Steph.

While Steph will torch you from 3 swinging a game in a few mins Jimmy will methodically get 30 efficiently through free throws and high % plays.  

Both Steph and Jimmy are floor raisers while Draymond is one of the top glue guys.

It’s a good team with Jimmy. It’s funny watching Warriors do a 180 on Jimmy. || [removed] || [removed] || So you're saying the Lakers just locked in the 3 seed with a game to go and can rest their whole team until the playoffs now? || [removed] || [removed] || Heat fan here. The fit is completely unsurprising to me, I get the larger worry was will Jimmy actually play seriously in the regular season, and also between the bs this year, injuries last year, and his tendency to be a bit less involved in the regular season, it’s been a while since we’ve seen him playing at his highest level so it was unclear how much gas he has left in the tank. But Jimmy when he’s working hard on offense is already a complete game changer who really just needs spacing to become a huge threat. Put that with the ultimate spacer with both guys being playoff risers with experience making deep runs and it’s hard to not believe they have a chance. I do think size can become an issue for them in the playoffs, but that duo alone is pretty ridiculous and can definitely win games against just about any team in the league when things are going right || Very insightful comment. Thanks! || You think this is the only era this happened in? You can see limitless examples from games 30 years ago || >find a way to run Edey off the floor in Memphis


Literally just play 5out like warriors like to do. Edey is useless when he's not inna paint || bro said edey. || Klay was really bad in his last 2 seasons, they probably attributed 2023 as failed vibe season cuz Draymond punched Poole, but 2024 became clear they were never gonna win another chip without some changes || [removed] || Yup. Agreed.

The only team that scares me in the West is Denver because of Jokic. Houston? Nope. OKC? Will be tough but not scared. Memphis? Hell no. Not scared. Minnesota? Maybe dangerous because of size but we're 3-1 against them this season and that's before Jimmy even showed up. I think we take that series too.

All of which is to say, with the 22nd toughest remaining schedule strength and a lot of momentum with Jimmy, I think the 6th seed is possible. And I also think if they somehow avoid Denver, they can make a real Playoff run too. At least through the West. || Dallas's size poses them a problem as well || It is not use man, this guy is a Warriors fan and LeBron hater, who tries to hide it by making ""thoughtful posts on this sub"".

Even if all that was not  true using a 5 game sample size when you have played bad and injured teams is not serious.

His use of stats is comical as well, lacks any context just copy and paste some stats and act like they are the bible. || [removed] || Yes, a 5 game sample. Because that's how many games Jimmy has played with the Warriors. It's not misinformation. You just don't like the information. 

How many games have the Lakers had Luka actually playing? 4 games. Why would I go backwards to analyze before that point? Makes no sense. You have a different team now and so do the Warriors.

DunksAndThrees predictive model does not like the Lakers right now. That's not misinformation. That's a fact. If you have access you can check it yourself. Only 10 games with a win probability 55% or more. You are 2-2 in the Luka Era. Could things improve? Of course! Will they? That remains to be seen. || It's not just about the quality of the wins and losses. It is that, regardless of the reason, they lost typically winnable games and they are running out of time, with a really rough schedule ahead of them. Time is limited. It isn't just about whether the Lakers, when they fully figure it out, are good, the question is if they are good enough to make up for this stage when they are ramping up, with such a difficult schedule ahead of them. || [removed] || He/She is an obvious Lakers/ Bron hater if you check his post history.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.045,0.862,0.093,0.98,0.109,0.753,0.138,0.9952
Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-02-25,nbadiscussion,1iycxsg,Interesting Fact: Luka was 25 years old (soon to be 26) when the Mavs traded him to the Lakers. Donovan Mitchell was also 25 year old (soon to be 26) when the Jazz traded him to the Cavs.,"Seeing all the crap the Mavs front office is rightfully getting for trading a pre-prime Doncic got me thinking - did the Jazz give up on Mitchell too soon? Obviously it's a very different situation and he is no Luka, but Mitchell has been pretty damn good since being traded.

- All-Star every year so far on the Cavs
- 2nd team all nba in 2023
- Likely 1st team all nba this year.
- Best guy on a team currently on pace to win 68 games this year

There's a pretty good chance that the Jazz don't get a player better than Mitchell from tanking or the trade return they got back for him.

The current Cavs clearly have a better supporting roster than the Jazz did, but the 2022 Jazz on paper seemed to have had the ability to build a good team around Mitchell (I'm not a Jazz fan so lmk if I'm wrong here, but I always did think it was weird of Ainge to blow up the team so soon) and were only 1 season removed from being the 1 seed in the west.

They could have kept their DPOY level Gobert to continue anchoring their defense - or use the massive return they got from the Gobert trade to retool around Mitchell. The Jazz also had a young Nickeil Alexander-Walker at the time (didn't know that until today, thought it was a cool fact) and most of their own FRP to trade to improve the roster.

Looking at Mitchell's success in Cleveland so far, what do you think of the Jazz's decision to trade him before this prime?",945,145,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iycxsg/interesting_fact_luka_was_25_years_old_soon_to_be/,2025-02-25 21:27:17,"The Jazz locker room was kinda collapsing, and they weren’t a real contender with no real way to improve enough to become one. There was also massive expectation Donovan would not re-sign/would ask out soon, so they moved him before that happened to get value. He’s also just straight not as good like you say. 

None of the above was true for the Mavs, so it’s a very different situation.  || The Jazz didn't really ""give up"" on Mitchell, the Rudy Spida core imploded and they didn't think they could keep him so they started over. || donovan would've left anyways. luka would've stayed. luka is way better than donovan (no disrespect, he just is) and jazz got more for donovan than mavs did for luka || The decision was pretty fair. Those jazz teams were pretty capped out in the sense there was little to nothing they could do to get better. By 2022 most of their players were old, Joe Ingles was gone, and many of the draft picks and young players they had developing on the sidelines didn't pan out in the slightest. The team was dead in the water. There was no reason to believe they could do more with no changes to the roster and just donovan getting better. It was best that they sold on the team when they did cause nothing was going to change. || I think it was clear he was going to push for a trade or leave in FA. That team had run its course. Luka was going to resign. It’s mind boggling the Mavs traded him. || There was rumors Mitchell wanted out but yes, they did give up on him too soon, especially since they got rid of Rudy who was the main guy Mitchell had a problem with. I was a big Utah fan at the time and haven’t watched a Jazz game since so yeah they fd up. And now Mitchell is first team all nba || The jazz actually got something back for Mitchell unlike nico Harrison who only got a pat on the back and 10 mil under the table from silver for making his boys contenders again || The Jazz gave up on him to rebuild and got an enormous package of picks and young players back.
The Mavs traded Luka because ""defense wins championships"", to win now. ||  mitchell hated rudy by the end im pretty sure, once they traded rudy though that team was done being a playoff team. it would be more like the mavs trading luka after striking out in the playoffs for a couple of years. || Yes the Jazz did give up on Mitchell to soon 

He is leading a historic offense and a number one seed 

While the Jazz are bottom feeding hoping that in the next 5 years they can get a guy as talented as Mitchell || One Luka >>>>>> Mitchell. Second Mitchell hated Rudy and wanted him gone or to be somewhere else. If the Jazz were going trade Rudy makes more sense to go for a rebuild then build around Mitchell who as of now is more of a tier two star and not a top five player. || That Jazz team was going nowhere, I know they were even a 1 seed at one point but no ever looked at them as a legit contender. 

Clarkson was a chucker and no disrespect to Bojan Bogdonavic but you’re not winning anything with him as your second scoring option.

They knew they wanted to tear it down when they brought Ainge in || Jazz got an All Star in Lauri, a solid 3rd guard in Sexton, plus 5 FRPs for Mitchell. That’s about as good of a return as you could expect. 

Nearly as good as the Paul George haul. The problem is they didn’t tank hard enough and didn’t trade Lauri last year when his value is highest. Now they’re in the wilderness.  || Jazz fans should trust ainge…he’s by far the best GM in the league but it takes some time. || Young superstars are being traded now and again and that is no biggie. The fact that Luka, an established generational player was traded for pennies under the table midseason after having an MVP-worthy regular season and carrying the team to the finals while having 15482 injuries and despite he declared he wanted to be a Mav forever is what is mind boggling. || Mitchell's problem in Utah was that he's too many shades removed from white. We all know they'd shit themselves in SLC if Cooper Flagg winds up there. || 1. Jazz were falling apart with a first round exit to a Mavs team missing Luka for half the series

2. Mavs made the finals the year before

3. Jazz got a better, young haul

4. Luka showed no sign of wanting out, Mitchell did

5. Luka was a quite a lot better than Mitchell at the time of the trades. Mitchell was “just” a solid all star with the jazz, not an all nba/mvp candidate caliber player || Only similarity is the age of the players imo.

Luka is unquestionably better at 25 than Mitchell was at 25.

Utah was imploding, Mitchell was going to ask out, and Utah decided to blow it up after failing to make any noise in the playoffs after many attempts.

The Mavs just made the finals and arguably got better in the ensuing off season. There was every indication that the Mavs were set up to be a contender until Kyrie got too old or retired. 

Reporting indicates Mitchell wanted to be traded. Luka likely wanted to retire a Mav.

Utah blew it up. Dallas made what can charitably be called a lateral “win now” move. 

The situations are not at all comparable, but yes Utah arguably gave up on the team too early. Considering the haul they got for Gobert, they could have attempted to retool around Mitchell, but I don’t think it would have been successful. Blowing it up was probably the right move. || Yes. Ainge only knows how to tear a roster down and pray for luck. Hopefully there’s a new Brad Stevens out there that can clean up his fucking mess when he leaves after the 4th tank reboot. || As others have said the team collapsed and he probably wasn't going to stay through a rebuild but Cleveland also got massive haul for moving him

3 firsts which haven't conveyed yet plus 2 swaps (plus agbaji who was just a lottery pick)

Lauri who has been an all star ( though they've probably hung on to him too long)

Sexton who's a quality starter

The Mavs got AD who is a HOF player in his prime but that's undercut by the fact that he was traded for someone younger, better and who you're planting stories of being a ticking injury risk as if that hasn't been AD's greatest weakness || Did the Jazz have a choice? There were so many rumors for so long with that. Imagine if Luka had had rumors for like 2 plus years he was gonna leave and sign with the Knicks or Heat. That would be more comparable and you have to also consider Mitchell played with poor effort the last year plus and things felt like they just needed a change. || To me Mitchell will never be the #1 option on a title team unless a lot of luck happens. I just don’t think he’s good enough || I'm not sure why people don't seem to grasp that it's not just that Luka was 25 when he was traded. It's not just that Luka is already established as a generational talent and got traded. It's because Luka was traded without wanting to be traded and traded for pennies on the dollar and not at all shopped.

25 year old stars getting traded isn't new or insanely alarming (though still headline worthy). The way the Mavs traded Luka will forever defy logic || Luka Doncic trade allegedly doesn't have anything to do with Basketball. It was either protest or sabotage by the ownership. || No one thinks Mitchell is a top 10 player or a generational talent.  This is a ridiculous comparison.  The Jazz never even made the conference finals with that team and he had a terrible relationship with ship and chemistry with the other star on the team.

The mavericks had great team chemistry, went to the finals last year and the WCF 2 years before that.  Neither team had any business getting past the 2nd round and no other player in the league, save jokic and maybe lebron, could have taken them as far as they did go. || The Cavs aren’t winning a championship with Mitchell as their best player. He’s never going to be a #1 I don’t think they gave up on him too soon the team went as far as they could go without a true #1. || yeah the rift between Gobert and Mitchell is also different from the chemistry the Mavs have.

They're just two professionals who see each other as colleagues and their interaction as purely business so we don't see the drama. || Keep in mind as well, the locker room was collapsing because of Lukas playoff dominance over them lol

It's crazy that Luka's dominance over Western teams in the playoffs have led to multiple team re-tools (jazz, Suns, wolves) || Yeah, hindsight, the Mitchell trade was overdue for all the reasons that were mentioned. Plus, they peaked. The Jazz weren’t getting any better and the West was beginning to get more and more competitive. They never stood a chance and they knew that.

The Luka trade has to be the worst trade in recent majors sport history. Idk (and, quite frankly, don’t care) what was going on between Luka and the Mavs (specifically Nico), but they literally sold their future for nothing. Luka is a generational talent. He has given that organization the most success they’ve ever seen outside of ironically another non-athletic ultra-talented European. He just took them to the finals last year, been a consistent MVP caliber player for the last several years… and they threw him away for what?

All they have to show for it is an injury-prone mentally fragile aging superstar (respectfully AD) and a player I can’t even remember the name of, and *1* future pick. They didn’t even get multiple, they only got *1*. Mavs need to be investigated, because that trade made no sense; the only rational explanation is sabotage. 

If you tried inputting that trade in MyLeague, 2K would actually crash cause the trade is so illogical. 

I’m not a Mavs fan, but I truly feel for them. The entire city of Dallas has every right to feel the way they do right now. || The nba also didn’t just get spanked in the ratings by the nfl necessitating they prop up their marquee franchise with a bogus trade.",0.0,0.932,0.068,0.4019,0.07,0.744,0.186,0.9913,0.088,0.805,0.107,0.9927
Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-02-27,nbadiscussion,1j0hguj,The Luka Lakers Are Figuring It Out... Thanks to LeBron's evolution from his heliocentric role into a 0.5 battering ram.,"The morning I filled in for Adam Mares on the All-NBA podcast with Tim Legler, I watched Los Angeles lose to Charlotte. As I took notes and pulled clips, I could only feel disbelief at how clunky the Los Angeles offense looked with two players trying to play the same role: heliocentric alpha.

LeBron James and Luka Doncic have thrived in this role throughout their NBA careers. They’re the basketball version of grandmasters chess players. They’ve seen every coverage under the sun, can make every shot/read in the book, and they both know how to move the pieces around the basketball chessboard with precision and ease.

Thanks for reading Low Man Help! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.

But like [Highlander, there can be only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcLjcSloXs), and as to the question of who would be that *one* for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

Players often say they want to win, but they really mean, “I want to win, but I want to do it playing my way.”

The Charlotte game felt like a line of demarcation for this team. Two heliocentric grandmaster chess players wouldn’t give them the best chance to win, so an evolution had to happen.

**Two BIG things have stood out to me since that Charlotte game:**

1. LeBron’s shift into a 0.5 Player
2. The Roberson Rule

**LeBron’s Final Act:**

LeBron James has shifted from the only role he’s ever known in the NBA into a 0.5 player[1](#footnote-1). This is a massive step for someone of his caliber; he’s undoubtedly one of the top players to play this game.

Since the clunky Charlotte game, Los Angeles has won four games in a row, three of which have featured both James and Doncic. In those three victories, James recorded his two lowest games of the season in average touch length and average dribbles per touch.

During the Los Angeles win over Denver, James set a season low for average touch length (2.892 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.83).

The Denver game was the only time during the 24/25 that he had been under three seconds per touch or two dribbles. Until the Los Angeles win over Minnesota, James again set a season low for average touch length (2.581 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.44).

The data indicates precisely what the eye test says: LeBron has shifted into the 0.5 player this team needed to reach its ceiling, and he and the Los Angeles Lakers are thriving!

**LeBron James Closeouts:**

* Before Luka: 1.033 Points Per Chance (52nd Percentile)
* After Luka: 1.351 Points Per Chance (87th Percentile)

One of the most significant benefits of James relinquishing the highlander role to Doncic has been seeing his first three steps transition from then defensive end to offense. James no longer waits for every outlet pass to control the chess board; he knows Doncic sees the same picture he does, so he gets on his horse and goes!

James has long been one of the league's best, if not its best athlete. However, creating offense in the NBA takes energy, and that burden fell on James more times than not. But with Doncic in Los Angeles, the on-ball burden is gone, and LeBron’s athleticism has been unleashed every play they’re on the court together.

**The Roberson Rule:**

JJ Reddick is using the NBA regular season as a defensive lab experiment. One theory he’s been beta testing is [Seth Partnow’s “Roberson Rule.”](https://x.com/SethPartnow)

The past week, Aaron Gordon, Russell Westbrook, Dante Exum, Naji Marshall, Jaden McDaniels, Jaylen Clark, and Tarrence Shannon Jr. have received Reddick's version of Partnow's Roberson Rule.

One of the things I always tell agents, scouts, or front office members when discussing shooting is that volume matters. Yes, it’s great to be a 40% shooter from the three-point line, but if the player turns down open → semi-open shots to pass or drive into traffic, the percentage doesn’t matter because they can be put into a box defensively.

The Roberson Rule is that box.

Since January 15th, Los Angeles has been first in defensive rating, opponents’ points in the paint, and opponents’ FG%. The results are straightforward; the lab experiment is working.

Reddick is unwilling to concede gravity to players he doesn’t believe will shoot enough volume to beat them. Instead, he chooses to shrink the defensive shell and shift more gravity to players who *can* beat Los Angeles, like Jokic, Kyrie, and Anthony Edwards.

# Ben Taylor showed what that extra gravity looks like when shifted towards a player (Jokic).

Even a few makes from Gordon and Westbrook didn’t shake his resolve in the Roberson Rule strategy; it takes volume. Your shooting gravity is not defined by your percentage but by a combination of three factors: Percentage, Volume, and Mechanics.

He knows that players who have never shot 15 threes in an NBA game don’t know how to deal with the emotional swings of missing nine threes and it still being a good thing for the team, and he’s betting on players not being able to step that far outside the Overton Window of volume.The Luka Lakers Are Figuring It Out...",1462,107,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j0hguj/the_luka_lakers_are_figuring_it_out_thanks_to/,2025-02-28 15:29:35,"Great article!

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || Side note but remember the “lebron can’t play off ball narrative”

Like idk where the even came from. Ig cause he’s always been the guy with the ball in his hands so they just assume he can’t. Especially with how much his shooting has improved, he’s lethal off ball. Saves energy and now he can use it to get boards, play defense, etc. his vision allows him to be a menace when cutting to the basket too. || Could someone please explain what a “0.5 player” is? I may be missing something, but I read the article on substack and tried a google search and I have not found an explanation that matches the context here. || Just want to point out - We are talking about how a 40 yr old finally unleashed his athleticism. || This was a fun read. Great analysis. Makes a lot of sense with their new personnel being fast enough for a close out on those guys instead of a proper gravity cover. I’ll be on the lookout for this next game. || Great article - one of LeBron’s main strengths has always been how remarkably well rounded he is in his game, combined with his brain. Even with that, I’ve been suprised how fast he has essentially worked out off ball play with Luka - is there any historical parallels of anyone doing this before? || [removed] || [removed] || [removed] || LeBron is trusting Luka - it also gives LeBron more rest and energy to do more dirty work and make plays when it matters, at this age this helps him chill a bit more and dial it up when it matters. || This was a great read, esp as a Laker/Bron fan rooting for him get that last championship run. || [removed] || Hey correct me if I’m wrong please but it feels like Taylor Jenkins also loves the “Roberson rule” and as an all 82 grizzlies watcher it frustrates me more than anything. It worked great vs Jrue Holiday but since then it feels like we’ve been burnt more than helped. || Bro I fucking hate Dallas for this. I’m finally ready to protest something lol || Lebron is getting more catch and shoot 3 opportunities, quality looks made possible by Luka having so much gravity and being an elite passer.

Then of course Lebron can rim run and is one of the best in transition which is easy money for a full court passing threat like Luka

People are mentioning Luka’s shooting slump, which is normal after an injury, but when you realize how often he’s double teamed and blitzed that’s what creates shot quality for other guys || LeBron’s never actually been heliocentric. We’ve gotten too liberal with the word. He’s always given other guys the opportunity to create, he’s always been a good cutter, he’s always utilized some post ups if the guard doesn’t have many options, etc 

Ball dominant? Yes

Heliocentric? No || > But like Highlander, there can be only one, and as to the question of who would be that one for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

I kind of disagree with this framing, as if LeBron playing off ball is the result of Luka being the better player, which he hasn't been in LA so far. LeBron even ceded ball handling duties to Westbrook to become a screen and short roll player when they were in the lineup together. To me this arrangement is the result of LeBron covering up Luka's weakness as an off ball player in the same way he covered up Anthony Davis' weakness as an on ball player. 

Even at this age, LeBron has less weaknesses than Luka and can do everything well and is an elite play initiator and finisher. Depending on what he has on his team, he can do either. So he's adapting his game to utilize the strengths of his teammate because he can in a way less flexible players cannot. || This isn’t accurate.

Since Luka arrived, LeBron’s touches per game have actually increased from 85.6 to 91.2, along with his scoring, which has jumped from 24.5 to 28.2 points per game.

For context, LeBron’s 91.2 touches per game surpass Luka’s 78.2.

Luka has merely come in to play point guard and distribute the ball to LeBron, but he hasn’t yet been the “alpha” or “Highlander” on the Lakers. LeBron has found a way to maintain that role—despite the devastating impact of 0.74 fewer dribbles per touch (shocking!). || I think Denver can put lineups out there (sans Westbrook) where you won’t feel as comfortable as you did last game. 

I think as teams see this more, they'll try to adjust as best they can. 

Boston can handle this coverage (obviously). Doing this on Golden State is scary because even though Green can't shoot, he's always a threat to get into quick two-man game actions with Curry or Buddy, who you must be up at the level to prevent open shots. || Hard to play this defense against the Bucks. I've seen teams all year focus on taking Dame away but then there is Giannis. As for role players AJ Green will gladly jack up 10+ 3s. To a lesser extent so will GTJ and Lopez.

Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-02-27,nbadiscussion,1izk0tj,Maybe We Should Rethink Unfair and Lazy NBA Narratives,"I do not post often on Reddit but I just had to get this off my chest. Please share your thoughts even if it's about a single sentence that I have written. Apologies if this post is an incoherent mess and a long rambly mess. I'm just trying to get my ideas out there. To start off, I do not claim to be objective and I have my own preconceived notions, biases, and prejudices. I could be mistaken in various of my points here and I am open to having a discussion about any of them. Also, I note lots of examples in this post so forgive me if these examples are not 100% exhaustive.

Peruse r/nba or r/nbadiscussion and you will see a variety of narratives, especially about superstar or HOF-bound players or even solid role players:

""LeBron James cannot win without a superstar teammate""

""Kevin Durant cannot win without Steph Curry""

""Russel Westbrook will never win a championship""

""It is impossible for Joel Embiid to get out of the second round""

""X player never won anything""

""Scottie Pippen can't lead a team""

""Allen Iverson single-handedly dragged the 76ers in 2001 to the finals""

""Dirk Nowitzki carried the 2011 Mavericks""

""James Harden cannot win as the #1 option"".

""X player jumps ship and moves teams when it gets tough""

""Chris Paul can't win a ring""

""Jimmy Butler has never won anything""

""The 50s and 60s players played against plumbers and milkmen""

""Jordan went 1-9 in playoff series without Scottie Pippen""

""Kevin Garnett could only win once he teamed up with other all-stars""

""X player is inefficient/is a ball hog/is a stat padder""

""Rudy Gobert is a bagless big and is overrated""

""X player got swept/convincingly beat in a playoff series, therefore Y""

""X player is greater than Y player because he stayed loyal to Z franchise""

""X player missed the playoffs in his prime, therefore Y""

""X player saved Y player's legacy""

""X player is no better than a scrub role player""

and many, many others...

Admittedly, I too, found some of these narratives convincing. You likely have reservations about one or more of these narratives. It is irrelevant whether or not these narratives are true. Players are devalued and valued based on things they largely have no control over. Regardless of whether you believe these narratives or not, they are ubiquitous in NBA discussions. All of these narratives are dependent on these outcomes decided by near inches or close games: Ron Artest's 2010 Game 7 Finals 3pt shot, Kyrie Irving's Game 7 Finals 2016 3pt shot, Kevin Durant's game-tying shot in Game 7 2021 ECSF, JR Smith's blunder in Game 1 of the 2018 Finals, Kawhi's Game 7 buzzer-beater in the 2019 ECSF, Jason Kidd's infamous momentum killing timeout in last year's 2024 Finals in Game 3, Game 6 Klay in the 2016 WCF, John Paxson's clutch shot in the 1993 Finals, Steve Kerr's clutch shot in the 1997 NBA Finals, 2002 WCF Game 6 Kings vs Lakers, Ray Allen's clutch shot in Game 7 2013, Game 5 1994 Bulls vs Knicks ECSF (Hue Hollins) call away. These are all moments that could have gone either way and should not define a player's legacy (the most overused word in NBA dialect nowadays) or their impact on winning basketball games.

All of these narratives are also dependent on injuries: Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving injuries in 2015, Draymond Green's suspension in 2016, Kevin Durant missing the 2015 playoffs and the entire 2020 season, Westbrook missing the 2013 playoffs after his meniscus tear, Steph Curry missing most of the 2020 season, Chris Paul getting hurt in the 2018 WCF, Kawhi's injury in the 2017 WCF, Klay Thompson tearing his ACL and Achilles, LeBron tearing in groin in 2019 and missing the playoffs, Kevin Garnett getting hurt in 2009, and I could keep going but I won't for brevity.

Some of these narratives depend on the situations of players drafted to not-ideal situations or bad front offices: LeBron was drafted to a mediocre Cleveland team in 2003, Kevin Garnett's time with Minnesota was plagued with misfortunes (like the Joe Smith situation, among others), OKC let go of James Harden and Demarcus Cousins was drafted to the Kings.

I find something wrong with denigrating or valuing players based on injuries they cannot control or outcomes that could have gone either way. Instead, players should be valued based on their individual performances and their impact on winning in a large enough sample size. I don't know what the sample size is so you can decide that. Maybe we need 40 playoff games to determine how well a player performs in the postseason. If so, then we should need around that same amount of regular season games to see how good a player is in general. I find it logical to value postseason performance more than regular season performance and most of us already do this.

You can have players who are individually excellent and impact winning tremendously (Jokic), players who are individually excellent but don't impact winning (Kevin Love in Minnesota), and players who are not individually excellent but impact winning (Draymond Green). Yet, some people value Draymond Green over Kevin Love or vice versa. That is an interesting conversation to have. It's not interesting to simply say ""Draymond has more rings than Kevin Love, therefore he is a better player"" because their circumstances are so different. I once thought like this as well, but I think it is a lazy attempt for our brains to make conclusions on highly variable situations and circumstances between players with completely different teammates, coaches, front office, the era they played in, etc.

As most of us know, individual players' stats do not tell the whole story and are not consistent indicators. Looking at box score numbers to determine a player's impact does not reveal that player's true impact. You could look at Box Plus-Minus, Win Shares, DBPM, Net Rating, PER, DARKO, or whatever other metrics to find the most impactful basketball players. A player's impact should be the only thing that matters when evaluating a player's greatness. We know Jayson Tatum impacts winning, but that does not stop someone from saying ""Oh, but he didn't win Finals MVP"". I think we need to stop this infantile level of discussion. I am guilty of engaging in this type of discussion myself. Whether we should value individual performances over impact on winning depends on the situation and that is a conversation we can have.

When I use ""we"", I am referring to some NBA fans, not all. Intangibles like leadership, mental toughness, and poise under tight situations, play a role in player evaluation, but it is unfair when the NBA community says ""X player is not a leader"" or ""X player is not clutch"" or ""X is soft"" when we are not in the locker room with that player and we cannot possibly have an inkling of knowledge on these intangibles. We use a few clips or quotes to make these conclusions about players without knowing the full story and circumstances behind a player. We use the stats of said player in the clutch as a way to be objective, we say, yet each clutch situation is highly different with varying circumstances. Instead of how players perform in the clutch under relatively similar conditions (we say it's too much work to do this), we just throw out the clutch stats of one player against another to make our conclusion. I must admit I have done this myself when debating with others on this particular topic. These types of conclusions are frankly lazy and we should do better as the NBA community.

We devalue LeBron James for his series against the Mavericks in 2011 and attribute none of that loss to the Mavericks' game planning, we blame Steph Curry for ""choking"" in 2016 and narratives persisted for years that he was not clutch even though that 2016 Warriors team was minutes away from winning the title, we say Jordan was 1-9 in the playoffs without Scottie Pippen as ""proof"" that Jordan is not as great as we say he is, we say that Kobe's legacy was ""saved"" thanks to Ron Artest's shot in Game 7 2010 Finals, we say that Westbrook is a selfish stat padder who will never win a title, among other narratives that try to make simple conclusions for outcomes. As a specific example, we forget that Iverson's 2001 76ers could have faced Vince Carter's Raptors in the ECF instead of the Bucks if Vice Carter hadn't missed that game-winning shot in Game 7 against the Bucks in the semi-finals. We don't know the outcome of a 2001 76ers vs Raptors ECF, but people would not be idolizing Iverson for ""dragging"" that 76ers team to the finals. We see Vince Carter as one of those very good players, HOF worthy, but not ""one of the greats"", when it's very possible he could have led his team to the finals in 2001 which would have given him extra ""legacy"" points. This is just one example out of many of how we elevate and denigrate players based on non-deterministic outcomes determined by mere inches.

The biggest problem is that NBA discussion is based wholly on simplistic narratives instead of actual basketball, which I am aware has already been talked about ad nauseum.  Whether a team wins a championship depends on so many factors including team chemistry, front office decisions, games decided in the last few seconds/minutes, playcalling, competent coaching, etc.

I could be wrong here, but I do not find it convincing that superstar players are the main reason for their team's success. They are the most consistent contributors to a team, but an individual player is almost never responsible for more than 50% of the team's offensive production. We say that Nikola Jokic is carrying the Nuggets this year. As of today's date 02/27/25, Nikola Jokic is averaging 29.2 ppg, 12.6 rpg, 10.4 apg (source: https://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/\_/name/den/denver-nuggets). He's contributing to 29.2 + (10.4 \* 2 < x < 10.4 \* 3) points, somewhere along the lines of 50 ppg for the Nuggets. Yet, the Nuggets score 121.3 ppg. The overall team collectively is contributing more than Nikola Jokic individually even though it may not seem that way when watching the games. The Nuggets have struggled this year, but it's not because of Jokic. This is an oversimplification of this point just for clarity. We expect a superstar's team to win when they have a 30-point triple-double or when they drop 50 points. We expect superstars to ""carry"" their teams to titles when basketball is a team sport. The idea of a ""#1 option"" or ""#2 option"" is another way for us to categorize players in a simple way. Fans, including myself, are obsessed with individual heroics. We blame superstar players when their teams lose. We call these players ""chokers"" when they perform poorly in playoff games. We say these players are not clutch or they are not ""killers"" like Kobe or MJ. If given a large enough sample size of poor performances in playoff games, then it is fair to conclude a player cannot perform consistently well in playoff games where teams are game planning against them (James Harden comes to mind, perceived as a choker, whether or not this is true is irrelevant). Yet, how many times have we seen a player have historic performances, yet still lose? Examples include:

Jordan's Bulls vs Celtics 1986 averaging 43.7/6.3/5.7 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1986-nba-eastern-conference-first-round-bulls-vs-celtics.html),

LeBron's Cavs vs Warriors 2018 averaging 34/8.5/10 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2018-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html),

Curry's Warriors vs Raptors 2019 averaging 30.5/5.2/6 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-finals-warriors-vs-raptors.html),

Durant's Thunder vs Heat Finals averaging 30.6/6/2.2 (source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2012-nba-finals-heat-vs-thunder.html)

We fail to realize that individual heroics do not always transcend the team's collective performance and they often do not. We shouldn't penalize players for that.

This is why player rankings, GOAT debates, and the aforementioned narratives lead to unfair discussions of certain players. If you've been watching the NBA long enough, you'll find these conversations stale and dull, for good reason. Looking at the most impactful players, basketball strategy, game planning, players and their individual performances is a much more fruitful conversation than only comparing the most accomplished. It's easy to compare the individual accolades between players. It's harder to compare their impact only.

We elevate players for winning MVPs, DPOYs, championships, All-NBA teams, and All-Defense teams when these are highly dependent on the talent in the rest of the league. It is unfair to elevate one player who has an MVP over another player who does not solely based on that accolade. When I compare two players, I ask myself this question: If I swap the individual accolades of the players I am comparing, does that change my perspective of them? Of course, the exception is players who would never win certain accolades in any era (Tony Allen likely never wins an MVP in any era and Isaiah Thomas never wins a defensive accolade in any era for being 5'9). If I swap the accolades of LeBron James and Michael Jordan, does that change your perspective of each player? If I change the circumstances (where they were drafted, front office decisions, teammates they have, etc.) of one player with another, does that have any effect on the careers of said players? The answer to both questions must be yes and it likely is for many readers. That is fundamentally a problem with how we evaluate players. We cannot make conclusions about an individual player's greatness based on their accolades or championships because these are situational and circumstantial. Many players who have won MVP would never have won MVP while playing in the 1990s while Michael Jordan was playing. That's not to undermine their incredible accomplishments, but context is needed especially when comparing and evaluating players.

I think that the only fair way to determine the value of a player is the impact they have on winning basketball games and their individual performances. Winning crucial playoff games and titles is dependent on much more than a superstar player's performance. I do not need to see Luka win a title to know he can be the biggest contributor to a championship team. He's transcendent enough to where I do not need to see him to do that to believe it. I don't need to see Jayson Tatum win an MVP to know he's an incredible basketball player. James Harden's Rockets were 27 missed threes away from advancing to the finals in 2018 yet according to NBA Twitter, he could never win as ""#1 option"" on a team. Yet, individual talent transcends being in varying situations. This is why superstar players who are healthy and in their primes consistently produce and don't average 30 ppg one year and 16 ppg the next despite being surrounded by different teammates, opponents, and coaches. Even being able to perform consistently among those wildly different conditions is praiseworthy (can we stop saying glazing whenever we praise someone?) to me. As such, the only fair criterion for players is their individual performances and how those performances elevate (or don't elevate) their teams. We've seen players be great individually but not consistently elevate their teams.

Because the playoffs have fewer games than the regular season, it is incredibly unfair to judge players solely based on that. Every single player has had bad games in the regular season, yet they cannot have bad performances in the postseason? The outcome of a basketball game is much more complex and has more variables than a superstar player's individual performance.

All that to say we should definitely value players who lead teams titles, especially more so when a player dominates the competition. All of these accomplishments contribute to the GREATNESS of a player, but not whether they are a better player than another player by themselves. Intangibles also matter a ton, but it is tough to evaluate them specifically. I find that when people talk about a player's intangibles, it's all about gut feeling. Please let me know if there is a way to evaluate a player's intangibles fairly. I personally must refrain from talking about intangibles because evaluating a player's intangibles is subject to our preconceived notions, biases, and prejudices, all of which I have. We're not in the locker room with a player, we're not aware of what they say or do in the huddle during a timeout, we don't know what the player says to motivate their teammates before a big playoff game, and we as NBA fans often do not have the knowledge to make conclusions on a player's intangibles. Of course, intangibles matter, but most NBA fans, including myself, do not have the information to evaluate them (even though we think we do). There is a reason many people question the validity of Bill Russel's 11 championships. It's because competition is a factor. There were only 8 teams and 9 Hall of Famers were on that 1960s Celtics team. Despite that, Bill Russel is (and should be) an all-time great but we often say Jordan was better for a multitude of reasons. The only thing that should matter is whether a player performs well and whether their performance elevates their team.

I just wish we were in a world where NBA fans could discuss basketball in its purest form instead of endless, unfounded narratives and dull debates about ""Who's the GOAT?"", ""Can X player be the #1 option on a championship team?"", ""Does X player have that dog or killer instinct in him?"", ""I need X player to drop a 40-point triple-double to win this game"", ""X player cannot carry a team"", ""X player will never win a ring because Y"", ""X player flat-out choked"", etc. Why can't we talk about a team's game plan against a superstar player to slow them down, why can't we talk about or argue how a player's individual greatness either elevates or denigrates their team's overall performance? Why can't we talk about role players without demolishing them for not being the biggest contributors on their teams? Why can't the NBA talk about actual basketball strategy? Talking heads like Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith who know very little about actual basketball strategy behind it have perpetuated these narratives for decades and it has seeped into NBA fan discourse.

TL;DR: I believe that when comparing and evaluating NBA players, we should only look at their individual performances, impact on winning, intangibles, and pure basketball strategy (game planning, defensive schemes, offensive schemes). Not winning titles or accolades only. A particular individual winning an individual accolade (MVP, Finals MVP, All-NBA, All-Defensive, All-Star) does not by itself make one player better than another. This is because these awards are based completely on the competition and the era you play in. A player winning a championship does not by itself make one player better than another. Most of us who have followed the NBA for a while already know this. This is because there are incredibly varying circumstances, injuries, and outcomes that affect winning titles or accolades.

If I could summarize my argument in one sentence, it would be this: Narratives that do not relate to individual performances, impact on winning (there is a difference between the impact on winning and winning), intangibles (I only trust evaluations of this from players, coaches, front office members, or other insiders of an NBA org), or basketball strategy are lazy and unfair attempts to evaluate players.

Again, I could be mistaken on all of this so please let me know what you think. I am open to being corrected about anything here.

  
EDIT: Thanks to DrizzyDayZD. I made a mistake when talking about the series between the Bucks and the Raptors. The Raptors faced off against 76ers in the ECSF in 2001, not the Bucks.

But all of these things are inherently tied to the team and environment that player plays in which can highligh certain strengths of weaknesses. 

>intangibles (I only trust evaluations of this from players, coaches, front office members, or other insiders of an NBA org

This part is specifically tough. For example, the Mavericks or Wolves just trade a guy like KAT and Luka, which by intent means they do not believe that those players can help them win, but is that a fair assesment? Its hard to predict the future regarding picks and trades. || This is not a very good post for a variety of reasons, but I'll point out just a few:

> Looking at box score numbers to determine a player's impact does not reveal that player's true impact. You could look at Box Plus-Minus, Win Shares, DBPM, Net Rating, PER, DARKO, or whatever other metrics to find the most impactful basketball players.

As the name suggests, BPM is based entirely on box-score numbers.

> I do not find it convincing that superstar players are the main reason for their team's success. They are the most consistent contributors to a team, but an individual player is almost never responsible for more than 50% of the team's offensive production. We say that Nikola Jokic is carrying the Nuggets this year. As of today's date 02/27/25, Nikola Jokic is averaging 29.2 ppg, 12.6 rpg, 10.4 apg (source: https://www.espn.com/nba/team/stats/\_/name/den/denver-nuggets). He's contributing to 29.2 + (10.4 * 2 < x < 10.4 * 3) points, somewhere along the lines of 50 ppg for the Nuggets. Yet, the Nuggets score 121.3 ppg. The overall team collectively is contributing more than Nikola Jokic individually even though it may not seem that way when watching the games. 

This is straightforwardly wrong according to the same advanced stats that you advocate for above. [Nikola Jokic has contributed 7.6 of Denver's 10.9 VORP this year](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DEN/2025.html). A team with Jokic and 11 veteran-minimum players would almost certainly be better than the Nuggets minus Jokic.

In my opinion, THE best source for actual analysis of the game of basketball beyond awards, narratives, etc. His website, YouTube channel and book are all valuable resources for understanding the inner workings of the game, how talented and contributive to winning players actually are, how context of the modern game informs our understanding of past trends, and much more beyond just what Shaq, Stephen A. and whoever else decide is the most lucrative topic for them to bring up that day. || You can’t just ignore circumstances and situational aspects though. That is all we have to base performance  off. Where someone’s drafted is a huge factor. Basketball strategy, game planning, and individual performances are all situational. Everything is situational who your teammates are, how healthy they are, do you have a good coach, front office have you set up for success or tanking. Does Tatum have the same impact on winning if he got drafted to the wizards instead of the Celtics. Does Jokic put up the same performances if Luka is on his team. If LeBron stayed in Cleveland he may not have any championships but who knows the individual performances he could have put up vs playing with Wade and Bosh. || Without looking at each example in detail I would say that broadly speaking, you are correct.

For those who prefer a quick summary, I used AI to condense it:

NBA player evaluations often rely on oversimplified narratives, championships, and awards, overlooking basketball's team-oriented nature. Players should be assessed based on their individual performance, impact on winning, and strategic contributions, rather than just titles, clutch moments, or vague intangibles like ""killer instinct."" Factors like injuries, luck, and team dynamics are often beyond a player's control, so discussions should focus on deeper basketball analysis instead of reductive debates.

This is part of the world we live in where entertainment companies of all sorts are constantly competing for our attention. People naturally have a short attention span when surrounded by novelties. And some of the headlines which have come out of sports in the past five or ten years are downright sensational. 



Along with that, there has always been a tendency among sports fans to have endless conversations about hypothetical matchups or career comparisons or talent levels. Combine that with our overexposure to bombastic media and we get these exaggerated takes on sports reddits. 



The same thing is happening in everyday speech. We all know how often people say “literally” these days. I don’t know if it’s because people are subconsciously becoming desensitized to descriptive language, but hyperbole seems to be on the rise. “X must be protected at all costs” “I’m literally dead” “James Harden is literally hitler”



Obviously these are meme phrases, but this kind of language exists all over the place, not just in sports. You are definitely picking up on this phenomenon where powerful language is more popular than rational discussion. Is this new to our digital age? Have people always had over-the-top arguments with each other? It’s probably a little of both. Whatever it is it’s everywhere and it certainly hasn’t spared the NBA. || Its simple...

But to your point, the trade is not ""pure basketball,"" yet it had (and still has) an enormous impact on the accolades that people like to use to evaluate players. 

The Celtics got to fast forward through rebuilding. Tatum and Brown joined a winning franchise, and got meaningful playoff experience from year 1. I'm a Celtics fan and I think Tatum is incredible, but when people bring up how high his playoff points are for his age, it's impossible to ignore that he was a #3 pick (and would have gone #1) who joined a team that won 53 games and made the ECF the year before he was drafted! That's not a knock against him, it's just a reminder that players exist in a broader context that has nothing to do with their basketball skills.

He was really just that good. Like, you can't be an outlier and shoot 10 3s a game. 

This isn't Larry Bird shooting 1.4 3s a game or something. 

I'd wager he'd be so much better if he didn't spam step backs that are contested so heavily most of the time too. 

But yes, he's clearly off his game on 3s, while being still fine on 2s lol, it's like the 2s never went away really, he just loves taking contested shots for some reason.

I think he is who he is at this point, with it fluctuating a percentage point or 2 every season, which is pretty good for the volume he takes. || Might be a shooting slump due to injuries and confidence.

This is true for most players, but for some on ball players like Luka, the step back and pullup and shots like those are more comfortable for them because they use their dribble to get into a consistent rhythm. They're not as used to a simpler catch and shoot. Some players prefer to dribble and even for the shots to be contested. Harden is similar, as was Kobe back in the day. || Yes he is, and I care about that even more. Not sure people understand the repercussions of this- this is the 2nd best offensive player alive who is now a good defender too lol || he also doesn’t really move off the ball like that to get those looks either. his most ‘open’ looks seem to be those middy pull-ups or when he slow-mo’s a layup || > He also took a lot of half court heaves last year which brings it down a bit

He took [5](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_shooting.htmlt) lol.  Without heaves he'd go from 38.2% to......38.3%. || A lot of good 3pt shooters had numbers like that going from the 80s into the 90s. It's mostly just a matter of really low volume. Shooting less means taking more hits to the % on misses from ""bad"" shots. 

When players are shooting ~1 three or less - then every miss from a full/half court heave or contested bail out at the end of a shot clock/game takes off a bigger chunk of your 3pt% (when compared to a higher volume of shots). 

This means about 5 misses like that at about one 3pt attempt per game will knock about 6-7% off your shooting percentage. 

In reality, that player is probably closer to a 36-37% shooter, which is respectable, rather than the ~30% shooter their actual stats would suggest. 

Guys like Craig Ehlo, Craig Hodges, Kenny Smith, John Paxson all shot worse when they were taking 3s at low volume (with some of them even shooting under 30%). 

As soon as their volume started going up they all shot consistently better. || That’s a good point! || Effort and instincts go a long way even in the NBA. I wanted Jokic to be dog shit on defense but he isn’t because of effort and instincts. Luka is also huge and strong. Even in an NBA body I wouldn’t want Luka running through my screen || Well, no lol. Look up their highest attempts in a game and that see if they shot 30% or what lol, check their most attempts in a month too, see how much lower it is than what their season averages are. I can do it for you if you want.
Nevermind,  I just noticed I read ur comment wrong, sorry boss || I'm talking more season to season. 

The players I listed (and there's probably more I'm forgetting) shot poorly at ~1 shot a game and then shot better as seasons went on and their volume went up. 

Bird is probably one of the most extreme examples along with Craig Hodges. 

Hodges went from shooting 28% on 1.2 attempts per game in his first three seasons - to shooting 43% on 2.7 in his next three seasons. 

Bird is even more erratic. He shot 40%+ almost every time he took more than 1.5 attempts per game. But he shot about 25% any time he took less than that. || Yeah, but it's somewhat clear he got better with time, just like LeBron has lol || In Bird's case it was almost always a matter of volume. He was pretty much a knock down shooter from everywhere the moment he came into the NBA. 

Bird shot 40% in his rookie season when he took 1.7 attempts from three per game. 

Then, the next 4 seasons, he shoots 0.9 per game and was at 25-26%. 

The season immediately after those four seasons, he shoots 42% on 1.6 attempts. He shoots 42% on 2.4 attempts the season after that. 

Supposedly his coach during those lower volume seasons didn't want Bird shooting threes IIRC. So, it would explain his lower volume in spite of shooting so well on more attempts in his rookie year. 

His worse two seasons at more than 1.5 attempts was near the end of his career. 89-90 he shot 33% on 2.6 attempts. 

But that's really an outlier for him and it comes with a pretty obvious asterisk - it was following his injury issues from the 88-89 season, where Bird only played 6 games. 

In 90-91 he was back at almost 39% on 2.8 attempts, though. And then he was at 40% in 91-92 on 3.3 attempts. 

But, yeah, outside of the one season after injury, Bird's season to season 3pt shooting percentage was almost always volume-related. || Surprisingly still a very good player at that age and injury though lol, I used to think he was cheeks, but nah, he was still the real deal. 

People need to just... look more into shit like this honestly. They just don't bother. Kinda sucks. || Yeah. Bird was so skilled and had otherworldly touch on his shot. At 6'9""-6'10"" that makes him nearly unstoppable. 

I also think people underrated his general quickness and fluidity when he was younger (and pre-injury). He didn't have much explosive speed or jumping but he was so damn quick with all his handling, fakes and jukes. 

Had he not had such serious back issues and whatnot (that weren't really even basketball related) he probably would have been near his prime for a few more years and made a bit more of an impact in the early 90s. Losing Bird's post prime years and then Len Bias really screwed the Celtics out of any serious contention during those later 80s/early 90s seasons.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.897,0.078,0.6994,0.077,0.773,0.15,0.9994
Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-02-28,nbadiscussion,1j0hguj,The Luka Lakers Are Figuring It Out... Thanks to LeBron's evolution from his heliocentric role into a 0.5 battering ram.,"The morning I filled in for Adam Mares on the All-NBA podcast with Tim Legler, I watched Los Angeles lose to Charlotte. As I took notes and pulled clips, I could only feel disbelief at how clunky the Los Angeles offense looked with two players trying to play the same role: heliocentric alpha.

LeBron James and Luka Doncic have thrived in this role throughout their NBA careers. They’re the basketball version of grandmasters chess players. They’ve seen every coverage under the sun, can make every shot/read in the book, and they both know how to move the pieces around the basketball chessboard with precision and ease.

Thanks for reading Low Man Help! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.

But like [Highlander, there can be only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcLjcSloXs), and as to the question of who would be that *one* for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

Players often say they want to win, but they really mean, “I want to win, but I want to do it playing my way.”

The Charlotte game felt like a line of demarcation for this team. Two heliocentric grandmaster chess players wouldn’t give them the best chance to win, so an evolution had to happen.

**Two BIG things have stood out to me since that Charlotte game:**

1. LeBron’s shift into a 0.5 Player
2. The Roberson Rule

**LeBron’s Final Act:**

LeBron James has shifted from the only role he’s ever known in the NBA into a 0.5 player[1](#footnote-1). This is a massive step for someone of his caliber; he’s undoubtedly one of the top players to play this game.

Since the clunky Charlotte game, Los Angeles has won four games in a row, three of which have featured both James and Doncic. In those three victories, James recorded his two lowest games of the season in average touch length and average dribbles per touch.

During the Los Angeles win over Denver, James set a season low for average touch length (2.892 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.83).

The Denver game was the only time during the 24/25 that he had been under three seconds per touch or two dribbles. Until the Los Angeles win over Minnesota, James again set a season low for average touch length (2.581 seconds) and average dribbles taken per touch (1.44).

The data indicates precisely what the eye test says: LeBron has shifted into the 0.5 player this team needed to reach its ceiling, and he and the Los Angeles Lakers are thriving!

**LeBron James Closeouts:**

* Before Luka: 1.033 Points Per Chance (52nd Percentile)
* After Luka: 1.351 Points Per Chance (87th Percentile)

One of the most significant benefits of James relinquishing the highlander role to Doncic has been seeing his first three steps transition from then defensive end to offense. James no longer waits for every outlet pass to control the chess board; he knows Doncic sees the same picture he does, so he gets on his horse and goes!

James has long been one of the league's best, if not its best athlete. However, creating offense in the NBA takes energy, and that burden fell on James more times than not. But with Doncic in Los Angeles, the on-ball burden is gone, and LeBron’s athleticism has been unleashed every play they’re on the court together.

**The Roberson Rule:**

JJ Reddick is using the NBA regular season as a defensive lab experiment. One theory he’s been beta testing is [Seth Partnow’s “Roberson Rule.”](https://x.com/SethPartnow)

The past week, Aaron Gordon, Russell Westbrook, Dante Exum, Naji Marshall, Jaden McDaniels, Jaylen Clark, and Tarrence Shannon Jr. have received Reddick's version of Partnow's Roberson Rule.

One of the things I always tell agents, scouts, or front office members when discussing shooting is that volume matters. Yes, it’s great to be a 40% shooter from the three-point line, but if the player turns down open → semi-open shots to pass or drive into traffic, the percentage doesn’t matter because they can be put into a box defensively.

The Roberson Rule is that box.

Since January 15th, Los Angeles has been first in defensive rating, opponents’ points in the paint, and opponents’ FG%. The results are straightforward; the lab experiment is working.

Reddick is unwilling to concede gravity to players he doesn’t believe will shoot enough volume to beat them. Instead, he chooses to shrink the defensive shell and shift more gravity to players who *can* beat Los Angeles, like Jokic, Kyrie, and Anthony Edwards.

# Ben Taylor showed what that extra gravity looks like when shifted towards a player (Jokic).

Even a few makes from Gordon and Westbrook didn’t shake his resolve in the Roberson Rule strategy; it takes volume. Your shooting gravity is not defined by your percentage but by a combination of three factors: Percentage, Volume, and Mechanics.

He knows that players who have never shot 15 threes in an NBA game don’t know how to deal with the emotional swings of missing nine threes and it still being a good thing for the team, and he’s betting on players not being able to step that far outside the Overton Window of volume.The Luka Lakers Are Figuring It Out...",1462,107,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j0hguj/the_luka_lakers_are_figuring_it_out_thanks_to/,2025-02-28 15:29:35,"Great article! As a Lakers fan the Roberson rule has been very noticeable on defense, taking away their best player (see the coverages on Jokic and Ant) in exchange for giving low volume shooters an open 3.

What teams do you think would do best against this kind of defense? Are there any with a solid playmaker surrounded by 3 point shooting? I'd think Denver but they struggled. || There are a lot of film edits/clips that add context to the words written above.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || Side note but remember the “lebron can’t play off ball narrative”

Like idk where the even came from. Ig cause he’s always been the guy with the ball in his hands so they just assume he can’t. Especially with how much his shooting has improved, he’s lethal off ball. Saves energy and now he can use it to get boards, play defense, etc. his vision allows him to be a menace when cutting to the basket too. || Could someone please explain what a “0.5 player” is? I may be missing something, but I read the article on substack and tried a google search and I have not found an explanation that matches the context here. || Just want to point out - We are talking about how a 40 yr old finally unleashed his athleticism. || This was a fun read. Great analysis. Makes a lot of sense with their new personnel being fast enough for a close out on those guys instead of a proper gravity cover. I’ll be on the lookout for this next game. || Great article - one of LeBron’s main strengths has always been how remarkably well rounded he is in his game, combined with his brain. Even with that, I’ve been suprised how fast he has essentially worked out off ball play with Luka - is there any historical parallels of anyone doing this before? || [removed] || [removed] || [removed] || LeBron is trusting Luka - it also gives LeBron more rest and energy to do more dirty work and make plays when it matters, at this age this helps him chill a bit more and dial it up when it matters. || This was a great read, esp as a Laker/Bron fan rooting for him get that last championship run. || [removed] || Hey correct me if I’m wrong please but it feels like Taylor Jenkins also loves the “Roberson rule” and as an all 82 grizzlies watcher it frustrates me more than anything. It worked great vs Jrue Holiday but since then it feels like we’ve been burnt more than helped. || Bro I fucking hate Dallas for this. I’m finally ready to protest something lol || Lebron is getting more catch and shoot 3 opportunities, quality looks made possible by Luka having so much gravity and being an elite passer.

Then of course Lebron can rim run and is one of the best in transition which is easy money for a full court passing threat like Luka

People are mentioning Luka’s shooting slump, which is normal after an injury, but when you realize how often he’s double teamed and blitzed that’s what creates shot quality for other guys || LeBron’s never actually been heliocentric. We’ve gotten too liberal with the word. He’s always given other guys the opportunity to create, he’s always been a good cutter, he’s always utilized some post ups if the guard doesn’t have many options, etc 

Ball dominant? Yes

Heliocentric? No || > But like Highlander, there can be only one, and as to the question of who would be that one for this Los Angeles team, well… The 25-year-old generational talent with a long runway in front of him would always be the answer.

I kind of disagree with this framing, as if LeBron playing off ball is the result of Luka being the better player, which he hasn't been in LA so far. LeBron even ceded ball handling duties to Westbrook to become a screen and short roll player when they were in the lineup together. To me this arrangement is the result of LeBron covering up Luka's weakness as an off ball player in the same way he covered up Anthony Davis' weakness as an on ball player. 

Even at this age, LeBron has less weaknesses than Luka and can do everything well and is an elite play initiator and finisher. Depending on what he has on his team, he can do either. So he's adapting his game to utilize the strengths of his teammate because he can in a way less flexible players cannot. || This isn’t accurate.

Since Luka arrived, LeBron’s touches per game have actually increased from 85.6 to 91.2, along with his scoring, which has jumped from 24.5 to 28.2 points per game.

For context, LeBron’s 91.2 touches per game surpass Luka’s 78.2.

Luka has merely come in to play point guard and distribute the ball to LeBron, but he hasn’t yet been the “alpha” or “Highlander” on the Lakers. LeBron has found a way to maintain that role—despite the devastating impact of 0.74 fewer dribbles per touch (shocking!). || I think Denver can put lineups out there (sans Westbrook) where you won’t feel as comfortable as you did last game. 

I think as teams see this more, they'll try to adjust as best they can. 

Boston can handle this coverage (obviously). Doing this on Golden State is scary because even though Green can't shoot, he's always a threat to get into quick two-man game actions with Curry or Buddy, who you must be up at the level to prevent open shots. || Hard to play this defense against the Bucks. I've seen teams all year focus on taking Dame away but then there is Giannis. As for role players AJ Green will gladly jack up 10+ 3s. To a lesser extent so will GTJ and Lopez. Portis & Prince will throw up 10 3s if given open looks as well. || [removed] || Boston, Cleveland || They playing the avgs. || Fully healthy wolves can run a lineup of DDV, Ant, Jaden, Naz, Rudy.   That lineup will launch 3s if left open, that type of defense would have a strong possibility of being a catastrophic decision. || Nice article! My only suggestion would be to explain what a 0.5 man is. I had no idea and had to find that in the comments. The Roberson Rule at least gets explained in the tweet that you have linked in the article (but not here). || nice piece, def enjoyed!  || I was hoping your substack would define this, what is a 0.5 player exactly? || Great work man, posts like yours keep me coming back here. Well done!! || Agreed.

Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-03-02,nbadiscussion,1j2uqf8,Real reason why the Mavs traded Luka,"I got 3 ""conspiracy"" theories that would make the trade make sense. I promise it will make sense if you read through it.

Theory 1: Luka already had a behind the scenes agreement to push for a trade to Lakers after getting his extension.

Mavs found out and were pissed because there was no way out. If they don't extend the best young player, a possible face of the NBA it would look ridiculous. They would also have to oblige to his trade request if he made a big fuss. When they found out, they wanted off as soon as possible. This still doesn't explain why they wouldn't shop Luka around and get the best deal though.

Theory 2: Mavs want to move the franchise to Las Vegas and needed support behind the scenes

Vegas is simply too much money to say no to. Mavs, like many others, want Vegas. But they had resistance stopping their move. The Luka deal was part of a bigger agreement that the Lakers would throw in all their support to let Mavs move to Vegas if they gave them Luka.

Theory 3: ALL OF THE ABOVE! Luka and Lakers had a secret deal. Mavs found out and wanted out. Mavs also needed support to approve their move to Vegas. All of that combined led to the Luka trade, with the understanding that Lakers would support Mavs making a move to Vegas.

Watch the Dallas Mavericks become the Las Vegas Mavericks within 2 years. I guarantee it.",0,39,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j2uqf8/real_reason_why_the_mavs_traded_luka/,2025-03-03 17:00:20,"Theory 4: Nico is a dumbass

Even if it was to buy the Laker’s vote, they still could have gotten way more. || **""Theory 1: Luka already had a behind the scenes agreement to push for a trade to Lakers after getting his extension.""**

No chance in hell. Luka was DEVASTATED after the trade. He still is. He'd have to be an Oscar-caliber actor to pull faking how upset he was at being traded from Dallas off. || Literally what indication has there been at any point in Lukas career that he wanted to go to the Lakers? To the point where he passes up a super max deal || Extremely original thoughts. Wowee. 

What will you do if you’re wrong? Can I propose wearing a dunce cap for a month straight? || Miriam Adelson didn't get her legalized gambling and is not willing to pay luxury tax. The team is simply an investment vehicle. She doesn't care for the team. 

All the stuff Nico said about Luka on the way out is a smokescreen for the Mavs being cheap || I’ll give you credit for thinking outside the box on this topic. 

The biggest flaw in #1 is that it would require Luka to be quite the thespian. Absolutely nothing in Luka’s history suggests that he’s a good actor. At all. 

I’ve heard a variation of the Vegas theory before, but I’m skeptical. Las Vegas is a much smaller market than Dallas. And Las Vegas is full of Lakers fans. Yes, the NBA wants a team in Vegas, but it doesn’t make much sense to abandon the Dallas market in the process. There are several other teams that would be more logical candidates to move to Las Vegas. || Theory 0: The Adelsons did not want to pay 35% of the team roster cap to a one player. They were not going to give Doncic the supermax next summer, because they would have ended in a serious 2nd apron situation and on major luxury tax. 

Basketball franchise is primarily an investment for them. They are not going to pump money into the team. They expect a certain level of return on their investment. The purchase was likely highly leveraged. All of their moves point to ROI maximization.

This negotiation with Doncic would have created a shit storm during the next off-season. Luka would have left without signing a deal, and the Mavs would have got nothing for him. That would be terrible business. Harrison actually said all of this in the first press conference after the trade. He said they (the franchise = owners) wanted to get ahead ""the incoming tumultous negotiations"".

All the culture talk and fat shaming is just window dressing. The owners did not really realize what sort of shit storm they would get from everybody, especially from Mavs fans.

I don't think the Adelsons would have offered the supermax to anyone in the NBA. I also think with the way the supermax is constructed – especially with the new tight apron rules – there are going to be other similar major moves in the next 2-3 years. Think about the Celtics and OKC for instance. Neither team can afford the wage surge that's about to hit them. || I think the trade was just the logical conclusion/apex of analytics guys running teams with a cold calculated “championship or bust” video game GM mentality. And Nico’s (terrible) calculation was that Luka is overvalued, and a bidding war for him would have backfired because Luka would dictate where he wants to go so they’d lose leverage. || or….checks notes and sees superstars not named Shaq don’t win titles with conditioning issues and even he had Wade or Kobe to close games for him.

The Mavs may not have wanted to risk hamstringing their franchise on a player they did not believe in . || Grand conspiracy theories sound nice, but in reality they probably just didn't want to pay him the supermax. I wouldn't rule out this being a move to get to Vegas it wouldn't be the first time an owner in the nba purposefully dismantled a team for profit, but a lot of the times owners just don't want to pay players that much money. They know the sports team will make money by default, so if your goal isn't a championship, why pay a guy that much money. Also you might want to post this to r/nbatalk instead. || There is absolutely no proof that Luka knew anything about this trade so that theory doesn’t even need to be discussed. 

Relocation requires league approval. Dallas is the 4th largest media market in the US. 18 of the top 20 largest media markets have NBA teams (including Dallas). DFW is also one of the fastest growing metro areas in the US. When you consider that the league operates with a revenue sharing structure, there is no chance that the other 29 owners will be on board with losing the revenue from the DFW media market. The Mavericks will never be relocated. 

In my opinion the reality of the situation is that Nico believes everything he’s been saying, and if he does than it makes sense to trade Luka. I don’t agree, but if you really think that Luka’s issues with conditioning and health are serious and will plague him for his whole career, it makes sense to trade him. 

They should have gotten a package on par with what OKC got for PG. That’s where they made their biggest mistake. Even if you do believe that these issues are serious, you ask for AD, Christie, Reaves, Knecht, and every pick that the Lakers have. And that’s just what it takes not to hang up immediately. To actually make the trade they need to find a third team and get 2 or 3 of their first round picks. That’s the haul that you should get when you trade Luka || I think he and the NBA wanted the trade and Nico is covering it up to allow Luka to keep his good guy image. || I think it's more a NBA/Nike thing wanting ratings and prime time player in their money maker the Lakers.  Mavs go along for benefits and possible move to Vegas. The trade just doesn't make sense otherwise. || The ownership group decided that they would not be willing to pay Doncic $345m guaranteed so at that point trading him was the only option. They got the best attainable player that was still able to keep the move quiet. 

Not sexy..but closer to the truth than any of this 🤷‍♀️ || I don't know shit but Erving's outspokeness about Jews might have upset Luka.  WWII is still very much alive in easters europe. || Theory one is stupid af 🤡 Luka obviously did not want to leave Dallas this was Owner and Nico Harrison’s call 🤡 || He is just dumb. He’s the only one deluded enough to think Anthony Davis is a top ten player and could lead a team to the finals. 

I wonder what he’s thinking now. Traded for AD cause of defense and the Lakers have been wayyy better without him on that end. Some dpoy huh.  || I’m going with this one || Agreed. The Peculiarity never saw the trade coming. || Every player at least considers it, some fantasize about it even they don’t admit it. It’s a basketball Mecca and it’s the biggest party city with Hollywood right there. 

Hell even Giannis considered it briefly a couple of years ago. That’s like Data considering joining the Borg for half a second. Didn’t think it could happen, but it did. || But…what I’m gonna do about the one I already wear??? || Hah great point Luka wears his emotions on his sleeve especially when playing. Can’t imagine him playing the secret agent. || And so they risked it on a player with an extensive list of injuries who has trouble staying healthy and got injured half a game in?? || Americans maybe. I doubt Luka gives two fucks about LA. || So you have absolutely no proof of reporting, and are just making up what goes on inside Lukas head? || Unless you are a personal friend of Luka Doncic, this comment is meaningless || a quick look at both players game played recently reveals Davis is the healthier player , he played 76 games last season which is more than Luka has ever done , 

in fact Luka has only played more than 70 games in a season 1 time and that was as a rookie. 7 years ago

Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-03-02,nbadiscussion,1j2c53x,Is it possible for LeBron James to score 50k regular season points?,"I can't believe I'm going to make an argument for this, but with Luka on the team now, LeBron might actually barely reach 50k points.
 
This season, LeBron James is averaging 25 ppg and has only missed 5 games out of a possible 59. However, his scoring has shown a clear upwards trajectory over the past month, so assuming he will average 27 points, playing 20 out of the Lakers' possible 23 games, LeBron James will end this season with 42377 points. 

We know LeBron will play in 2025-26. Let's assume he stays at 26 ppg for that year, playing around 73 games. This is around the same as last yr, and with a primary playmaker, we can assume a similar volume. At the end of the 2025-26 season, LeBron will have 44275 points. 

Now we enter speculation zone. However, I think it's probable that LeBron would sign at least 1 more two year contract, especially if the Lakers are contending, which is seeming likely. 

In 2026-27, LeBron would become 42, which means we should expect some dropoff.... but should we? I personally believe LeBron will lose some step by this time, but not so much that he would be scoring less than 24 ppg. Assuming he misses around 9 games again, this brings LeBron James to 46027 points. 

At this point, we see the vision. If LeBron James decides to chase the 50k mark, he can play 3 more seasons playing only 60 games a season, and average 23 for that to get there.

If he's still averaging 25 for 70 games in 2028, he'd be at 47777 at the end of his contract, which means he'd only need to average 16 a game for two more seasons playing 70 games. If he only plays 60 games, for those last years, he'd only need to average 19. 

It is possible, given his current trajectory, that LeBron James will retire with 50k career points to his name. The fuckery will, in fact, continue.",986,234,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j2c53x/is_it_possible_for_lebron_james_to_score_50k/,2025-03-03 01:07:54,"He’d have to play another 7 years or so. It’s probably **possible** but it’s not going to happen unless he changes his mind. Even he said he doesn’t want to play for 5-7 years more || It is possible. I just don’t think he will play that long. I’m a huge Bron fan. I hope that he plays forever and puts every longevity stat completely out of reach, but I just don’t see him playing beyond 2028 and even that might be a stretch. || Yeah I think if he wants to keep playing, 50k is within reach. It's absurd how good he's been this season, barely any regression in his game from the past few seasons. || I think father time will stop this from happening. Lebron himself said that he won't be here when the 2028 Olympics comes around. He's already owns the points record so there's really no incentive to hit 50k points. || No. What LeBron is doing is incredible, but he can't do this for 6 more years. Father time catches all. || I fear time will stop him. I see it going similar to Nowitzki were rather suddenly he will  move like a man his age ;) || There is no way he does this, as much as I would want him to. Maybe he gets to 45k. || Don’t get me wrong, we have all been burned before by assuming LeBron will stop eventually. 

But he won’t go on forever. I think another 4 years is the absolute limit of what we’ll see from him. Including his player option, he’s contracted until the summer of 26. I could see him sign another year with a player option, maybe 2 with a player option beyond that if the Lakers are contending and he’s still contributing at an all-star level. 

But as soon as he stops being seen as one of the best in the league, I think he’s done. Yes, he could in theory get to 50k points, but there’s a lot of things in basketball he COULD do, that there comes a point where continuing to set goals is near impossible. Because what’s next? 55k? 60k? Hell, if he’s still an elite player at age 46, does he want to be the first NBA player to be 50 years old and still in the league? Once the scoring record is out of anyone else’s reach in a year or two, does he start looking at Stockton’s assist record?? No matter how long he plays, there will ALWAYS be a goal he could’ve reached but left on the table. || If Lebron gets to 50k regular season points, I'll go ahead, buy whatever Lebron shoe is coming out that year and eat it in front of a camera and post it on reddit. || He can if he wants to. But does the FO want to pay him near max or max money given that they have Luka on the team? The money to be paid would go to an up and coming guy or some bench pieces that would make the team well rounded instead of the current pieces they have. || At this point, he doesn’t want to keep playing in the league to just hit a 50k mark. It is physically and emotionally taxing to have to doing the offseason workouts, the ramping up, the early morning shoot around and the traveling. He probably wants to retire and have his family life and other career (movie, shoes, endorsements) take off. For me as a basketball fan, I would like to see LeBron keep pushing the limits of his age and defy aging and keep up his insane consistency. But I totally understand his perspective. || If Luka takes over I wonder if there’s a world where LeBron does go after it and maybe transitions to a bench guy in a few years. Play 15 mpg during the regular season. Guide and develop the bench unit, able to play close games at the end when he’s needed, do more in the playoffs? 

With his basketball brain and considering how well his body has held up, he may not have stamina, but could a fresh, 45 year old LeBron still give you 15-20 really
Impactful minutes? That seems quite possible. || I don’t think there will be a major drop off but there will be a slow decline which has already started. It’ll get to a point where he dips below 17ppg and the argument for 50,000 will die. It’s just too much || I would love if LeBron does that. But realistically no. I do think with Luka and especially if lakers can get a title this year, LeBron extends his playing time by one more year. I say Bron plays 2 more years after this season. || As a Lakers fan, I was against signing Bronny. It seemed like a waste of a pick.

But now I'm wondering if LeBron's incredible season isn't in part due to his great enthusiasm for playing with Bronny. Could have helped give him the mental boost to keep going full bore at the age of 40. || Announce random drug testing and he will retire this year. Or at least within the year. 

And yes, everyone does it now. Obviously. But im being forced by the media to think the new juiced up guys are better than Larry bird because the extra juice allowed their bodies to break down later. Sorry, can't do that. || He is already #1. I could see him going for 45k pretty easily and considering that a career well done. He doesn't have anything more to prove or accomplish in a rankings sense, at least nothing he can control. || At first when I read this, I thought it was crazy. After reading the comments though, it's giving me flashbacks to a thread from maybe 10 years ago that was basically saying that Lebron could realistically break Kareems record. All of these comments are saying the same exact things they were saying back then lol. || Legit question - if he slowed down (say from father time or injury) a tick or two, wouldn't his strength, frame, and skill set still make a great center for 20 minutes a game? || Lebron scored 6,007 points in his first 3 seasons, through his age 21 season. Kareem was in college then. I think lebron will want to eclipse kareem by at least that number of points to ward off any argument that his record has an asterisk, because he got the benefit of three extra years in the league while kareem was dominating college. So i think he’ll want at least 45k || I’m guessing he goes for 45,000 then calls it a day.  No ones  catching that number. || yeah that’s super easy. So we just count his playoff points. bada bung bada boom. || I think it’s possible.

He’s already 40. Would his body really decline that much more by the time he’s 43-44? Probably not (barring any significant injuries). I think it comes down to motivation, and the Lakers will be contenders for at least the next 2 seasons. That’ll get him to 45k. From there, it’s all about how much he wants it.

One thing we should all know about LeBron is that he’s very petty - he would want nobody else to break his ATS record ever, and if he hits 50k it would surely cement that. || It's definitely possible. Currently he puts up at least 1500 pts a year during the regular season. As long as he shows no signs of slowing down, and maintains scoring 1500 pts a season, he can absolutely get it done in 6 years || technically possible but it won't happen. He's stated repeatedly his plan to retire in the near future (my guess is after 2028) and as he ages into his mid 40s the injuries will become more common || Is there a max age limit? Could bron be 60 and still play as long as there’s someone signing him? || It’s possible but he’s just not gonna wanna do it.  I’m pretty confident in saying that he’d still be a decent player at 45, I just don’t know why he’d wanna do that || I think it’s gonna be after the ‘28 season and the Olympics but it’s gonna come down to that Las Vegas expansion team really. Luka and his sons give him incentive to keep playing but I see 2-3 seasons after this, whenever they give him that team. || His longevity is truly unprecedented, so nobody can really say it's impossible because there's no reference to make predictions based on. That said, I think it's highly unlikely. || Possible, yes. Likely, no. 

He’s said on numerous occasions that he’s done everything he set out to. He has absolutely no reason to want to chase 50k reg season points. I’ll go out on a limb and say we’ll all be dead and gone before another generational athlete comes along and surpasses what he’s done.

Yes, LeBron is 40 years old, but he's not just coasting – he's putting up a season worthy of MVP consideration, and here's why:

**LeBron is defying Father Time (again!):** Over his last 30 games, he's averaging 26.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 8.2 assists per game. Those are elite numbers for any player, let alone someone with two decades of mileage. He's also shooting efficiently, at 54.7% from the field and 43% from three. And get this: since Luka Dončić joined the Lakers, he's been even better, averaging 28 points and 10.1 rebounds per game!

**Elevating a Flawed Roster:** Let's be real, the Lakers supporting cast was considered weak before Luka arrived. Even now, many consider the team poorly constructed. Despite this, LeBron has kept them competitive in the loaded West. He's the leader of this team, guiding them through inconsistencies and making his teammates better.

**The Three-Way Race (Last 30 Games):**

Here's how LeBron stacks up against the other frontrunners over their last 30 games:

* **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander:** SGA is having an incredible season, leading the league in scoring. Over his last 30, he's averaging 34.7 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 6.5 assists. While his scoring is higher than LeBron's, LeBron edges him out in rebounds and assists while playing with a weaker supporting cast.
* **Nikola Jokic:** The Joker is a triple-double machine. In his last 30 games, he's averaging 26.4 points, 12.1 rebounds, and 11.5 assists. While Jokic leads in rebounds and assists, LeBron is scoring at a similar clip while demonstrating greater leadership and impact on a less balanced team.

**LeBron is making history.** No one in NBA history has ever performed at this level at 40 years old. Karl Malone won MVP at 35, and LeBron is exceeding those numbers. This is unprecedented territory. He already made history last year by becoming the oldest player to win any kind of MVP award when he won the inaugural In-Season Tournament MVP. A regular season MVP would be another legendary milestone.

**Conclusion**

LeBron James is proving that age is just a number. He's not just playing well for a 40-year-old; he's playing at an MVP level, carrying a flawed Lakers team and putting up historic numbers. While SGA and Jokic are having fantastic seasons, LeBron's performance, leadership, and the sheer defiance of his age make him a truly deserving candidate for the 2024-25 MVP award. His stats and greater win-share over the last 30 games prove it:

LeBrons been amazing but let’s be real || If LeBron played the way he currently is all season I'd agree.

No argument for him over SGA or Jokic with only a month and a half of him playing at this level || Being 40 doesn’t make him the mvp. He is simply not as good as Jokic or SGA. Giannis or Tatum too. He’s 5th at best || This is a terrible take. By your logic, if LeBron played until 50, and averaged 10, 5, and 5, should he win MVP then too, because ""holy shit no one has ever played like this at ***50***""? || If he played like this all season then yeah, but he only playing like this because Luka is on the team now || Feels like a Lebron glazing post lmao. Many thing you mention really had nothing to do with MVP and you credit him everything while ignoring AD starting his year as MVP candidate.

Lebron defying father time, perfoming like that at 40...blah blah has nothing to do with MVP voting, and he is not even the clear best player in that team before the trade, AD were providing DPOY calibre defense while sharing the offensive load, iirc he was among the top MVP leader until they lose to Denvers. 

Also 27/8/8 is not better than what Shai and Jokic is providing lol, not close. I will happily take 34.6 ppg on great efficiency and great defense and triple double monster on all time great efficiency over whatever Lebron is doing right now every days of the week || I love bron, but he’s just not deserving this year, I do think he deserves first team though. || Just Insane, I guess just throw out the numbers & team records. 

Who cares how old LeBron is. MVP comes down to who had the best overall stats plus your team's record.

Jokic is averaging a Triple Double as a Center, Mind Blowing because he's not even trying to get them, it just happens in the flow of the game.

SGA is the leading scorer on the Best team in the Western Conference which is also the Best Defensive team in the league. 

MVP's aren't Lifetime achievement awards. This isn't the Oscars || It's not the ""most valuable player when corrected for age"" award.

I am firmly in the camp of thinking that LeBron should have more mvps than he does and I still think you're making a terrible argument. 

If it were actually an individual award based solely on this season Jokic would win easily. Since it's a media based narrative driven award that for some reason gives you a bonus for playing with better teammates (resulting in more team wins) and Jokic already has multiple mvps and voters are ""fatigued"" it's close and SGA might win.

The way the Lakers are playing LeBron still has a shot at finals mvp, but there's no reasonable argument for him to win mvp this year. || Lmfaoooo lakers are only winning now cause of Luka. LeBron off ball and less strain on him. He has no chance of winning over SGA or joker || Lebron is playing like a top 5 player right now. Not just for the last X weeks, but for the season. Which is astonishing, honestly. He is 4th in the league in VORP and PER as well as 7th in BPM. But he has no statistical argument for MVP with how insane Shai and Jokic have been. They are both a tier above the competition. 


I hope Bron gets 1st team honors, but it would be pretty insulting to give him MVP unless things change dramatically down the stretch.  || AD led the Lakers in Estimated Wins until 2 games ago lol.  Also take a drink every time OP says ""last 30 games"". 

*Warning: do not play the LeMVP Drinking Game while operating heavy machinery.* || I do not think that his age should have an impact on him getting an MVP, it is impressive what he is doing at that age but it shouldn't be a factor. || SGA is playing absolutely bananas right now, it's his to lose. His numbers are bananas, his team is #1, Chet has barely played, and JDub is not as good as he was last season. || Say, how exactly does Lebron have  better leadership and impact compared to Jokic? What did you use to measure it? || I agree. Also, LeBron doing this at 40 shouldn’t be a factor for MVP discussions, his age makes his performance more impressive for sure, but not more valuable

Edit: Just to clarify, I said *shouldn’t*, I understand that the MVP is a narrative award but it *shouldn’t* be || tatum is a convo, but i’d still pick tatum i think. doesn’t really sniff the others even though he is playing out of his mind || Tatum should not even be in the conversation. Zero consistency plus team under performing || lol he’s better than sga, if you’re saying you’d rather have sga for a playoff series than bron you’re out of your mind || I think the idea is more so ""If you average MVP-caliber box score stats and you do something groundbreaking, you automatically enter the MVP conversation,"" probably meaning Top 5-ish. || He started playing like this since AD’s been gone/out. But I agree, lebrons early season really killed his chances. || First Team at 40 years old would be one of the wildest things ever || Narrative is a big deal. But his numbers and even record isn’t good enough either way || In a perfect world, yeah. But narrative does play a part. If it didn't, there's no way Rose wins that 2011 MVP, unless the voters really just don't understand that the Bulls hung their hat on defense and Rose played the Iverson role, keeping a team of elite defenders afloat offensively. Same with Westbrook averaging a triple-double.

LeBron's longevity narrative isn't enough to get him the MVP this year, but the voting process isn't completely free of human emotion and bias. || Eh, they have made exceptions for accomplishing out of the ordinary things, Westbrook’s first triple double season was awarded specifically because that stat line hadn’t been seen as a recent example.

It is hardly ever given to the actual most valuable player.

That being said, I didn’t see how it should be given to anyone other than Jokic this year, he is top 3 in points, assists, rebounds, and steals, shooting at an insane fg% including 44% from 3, with an astronomical PER.

Shari is the only other person with a case. 

But again, I think mvp is more about narratives now so it wouldn’t be out of the question that Lebron doing what he is at 40 could win it. || Nobody besides the top 3 are “in the conversation” but he’s a solid 4th || That's like not the criteria for MVP at all dude || MVP isn’t “who would you want in a hypothetical playoff series that hasn’t happened” it’s about who played the best in the 2024-2025 season || Nah I take Shai over him. The recent seasons has shown Lebron is not the ""if I have to take one player for a playoffs series"" Lebron anymore. He missed the playoffs, cant do anything stop Denvers even when AD playing like the best player in the world and got gentle swept back to back. He is nowhere the Final appearance monster he used to be whereas Shai is entering his prime, providing better scoring and way better defense. || That's still a stupid argument.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.03,0.82,0.151,0.9963,0.102,0.685,0.213,0.9996
Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-03-04,nbadiscussion,1j4e9tx,21-22 Warriors vs. 21-22 Suns? & 22 Suns vs. 22 Celtics Finals?,"Hi all hope you're doing well!

As we may remember, this is the season the Suns were on an absolute tear. They went 64-18 and appeared to be built to counter the Warriors.

Unfortunately, this is also the year they totally crumbled against the Mavericks in the playoffs, with a near 40 point loss in game 7. 

The Mavericks would go on to be gentlemen swept by the Warriors - they just didn't have the experience it seemed, compared to the Warriors playoff experience. That and / or, they were gassed from the 7 game series vs. the Suns.

Now the question here is - what if the Suns faced those Warriors in the WCF? Would the Suns win? Whatif Sports actually gave the Suns a strong sweep.

**In other words, did the Suns run into the worst team against them, a heliocentric Luka they simply couldn't stop, or was it exposing their poor coaching and real inability to succeed at high-level playoff basketball?**

**And what if the Suns beat those Warriors and made the Finals - how would they fare against the Celtics?**",26,32,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j4e9tx/2122_warriors_vs_2122_suns_22_suns_vs_22_celtics/,2025-03-05 16:18:16,"Which Suns team are you asking about?  The one that played the first 65ish games of the season, or the one that was in the playoffs?  If you want to talk about the first option, then no, the Suns would have been the favorites through the whole playoffs.

The team that actually made it into the playoffs though?  They had no shot against the Warriors or Celtics.  I mean no disrespect to the Mavericks, but they didn't beat the Suns, the Suns beat themselves.  That last month or so before the playoffs, something happened, and the team lost all of it's hunger and chemistry.  You may forget, the round 1 series against the 8th seed Pelicans was VERY close.

The game 7 against Dallas was just the prime example of what people watching the team saw.  The Suns were done, and didn't would have been swept by Celtics or Warriors. || One of the things that makes the playoffs different from the regular season is the increased importance of gameplanning and the chess match of adjustments teams make. And in the Conference Semis [Jason Kidd coached circles around Monty and his inability to make adjustments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekU6-AMcU6M&t=449s) and I'd bet all my internet points that Kerr would have too because we've seen him make those exact same adjustments and he had a better toolbox than Kidd.  

Dallas used versatile big Maxi on the perimter, Kerr has the goat versatile big defender in Draymond as well as OPJ, [Looney](https://x.com/anthonyVslate r/status/1528463091624730624), and Bjelica ([don't laugh](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/va0grp/highlight_compilation_of_34_year_old_nemanja/)). 

Dallas pressured Booker's playmaking and handle, Kerr and GS famously did the same thing to Tatum and Brown in the Finals. 

Phoenix feasted by attacking Luka in G1-2, with Kidd using hedges to help hide Luka the rest of the series and the Suns never figured out a counter. But [GS had been dealing with this for years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqwTkgj5ORY&t=112s), **the Dubs weren't going to get blown out twice in the series before they figured out how to hide Steph**.

Dallas used a combination of full court pressure, zones, traps and excellent help defense to beat the Suns. That again is already a [strength of the Warriors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MdwxO17uh0&t=308s).  

Now let's just look at the rosters and look at **guys with similar roles and [MPG](https://www.statmuse.com/ask?query=dal%20and%20gsw%20players%20in%20the%202022%20playoffs%20with%20at%20least%2010%20mpg%20by%20highest%20MPG&preferred_domain=nba&direct=true&l&t=1741430422556)**: 

Steph > Luka (any impact stat, eyetest, experience)  

Draymond > DFS (DPOY defense outweighs DFS's better 3P%)  

Klay >= Brunson (similar TS, Klay a better defender, Brunson a better creator)  

Wiggins > Bullock 

Poole > Dinwiddie (JP +9% TS, both dogshit on defense)  

OPJ/Bjelica ~ Kleber/Bertans  

Looney >> Powell 

Kuminga/Moody/DLee >> Ntilikina/JGreen/Chriss/Burke

I believe Iguodala and GP2 were out this series but they might have been available late if GS was facing elimination. 

Overall just a stronger roster top to bottom and GS was deeper and fresher. Their offense is harder to guard and their defense could do anything to Phoenix that Dallas could and more.  

I like Kidd as a coach but still put him behind Kerr overall and Atkinson and Brown were on another level from the Mavs assistants.

**Warriors over the Suns in ~5 games seems extremely likely.** Yes they split in the regular season but that rarely means much for a 7 game series. Like cmon, Juan Toscano Anderson averaged 20 minutes against the Suns in the regular season. || There’s no way that a team capable of losing a home game 7 by 40 was going beat those Warriors in a series. They were not mentally up to it. || I think, biased-ly, the series would’ve played out like the Christmas game, dubs in 6. That said If we played the Suns I think we woulda been gassed and beat by Boston || I really wanted that Suns/Warriors playoff matchup in 2022 man, all their regular season games that year were must watch. I remember Otto Porter Jr killing them on Christmas that year. || My perspective:

I feel the Warriors would have been a great battle for the Suns, and it was what they seemed to be prepped for year long - a team that plays team basketball.

It would have been great to see CP3 get his revenge against Steph. I think the Suns would win in 6 or so because they were just too talented top to bottom. Ayton would feast as well, as the Warriors just had Looney - who did play well but didn't do much against Jokic the round prior nor would against Ayton.

  
It's very interesting because Kerr has said on record that he didn't think that year was their year to win. He even told the team such, and I feel that year was almost 'gifted' to them because they didn't have to face the Suns -- no disrespect though, they fully earned it against the Celtics, although the Celtics crumbled as well.

There's always asterisks and sometimes the path to the ring can be easier because other teams weaken a really good team - there's always a year like that - sometimes they just don't have to face the best team.

I am aware I have a little bias as I would have loved to see another team win that year, but being aware of it, I can put it aside as well. I would have loved to see if those Warriors would stand up against a great team or a team that played great though. Nuggets were without Murray, Celtics crumbled, etc. 

I'm not certain they'd lose, I'd just love to see them have worked harder for it I suppose. See them pushed to their limits || If you look up ""paper tiger"" in the dictionary you'll see a picture of the 2022 Phoenix Suns. If they didn't lose to the Mavs they woulda lost to someone else. || Thank you for this as I didn't know this. Can you explain more? Looking at the game log, I see they had a 9 game winning streak at the end of March, then lost to the grizzlies the 1st of April, then the starters didn't play the remaining games.

I believe you, and some things are beyond the box scores, so I'd love to hear more || Well the question being mainly if those Mavs were their kryptonite, for whatever reason || Curry doesn’t get gassed || Yeah I was just thinking of that too - would have been a really fun series and, that was the Suns last real window! || The Celts certainly tried. Steph went nuclear game 4 and took the advantage. So much plays into it but that part feels very tangible. || You can point out all of those supposed caveats, and the Warriors imo still had the hardest path to the championship of any of the teams that have won so far in the 20's. 

Denver beat 0 50+ wins teams. Weak finals opponent. 
Bucks beat 2 who would have been 50+ wins (shortened season). Good finals opponent.
Celtics beat 1 50+ win team. So-so finals opponent. 
Lakers beat what might have been everything from 0-3 50 win teams. Weak finals opponent. 
The Warriors beat 3, and had imo by far the hardest opponent in the finals. The Celtics dominated everyone since christmas that season, and were likely the best team that didn't win it all this side of the 20's. 

About injuries, you can point out such things in every year. So, i won't go down that particular rabbit hole. || If you haven’t yet, I definitely recommend checking out a supercut of the Suns/Pels series from that year. It’s really fun basketball. 

IMO you can feel the surprise wash over the Suns gradually and it’s the last time we see Chris Paul put on the cape and win a game through sheer greatness - I can’t remember the game but later on in the series he went like 10/10 (Edit:14/14) from midrange. 

** EDIT: I’ve since been reminded that Booker was hurt for most of this set which explains it going as long as it did, despite no Zion **


It’s funny looking back because 2022 gets a bad rap for being “weak” as a playoffs but it has some really fun and/or compelling matchups to ME 


Suns/Pels


Grizz/Minn for young Ja vs. younger Ant


Mem/GSW


Dal/Phx game 7 to watch the car crash 


Jazz/Mavs for the Jazz horror and the Brunson of it all


Raptors/76ers to see the 20/20 hindsight of Nick Nurse weirdness, The Raptors funky defensive game, and Embiid being brought down like (no disrespect) a cave troll over a handful of games


Bucks/Celts - nobody could decide who was better, least of all these two teams


Heat/Celts - the legend of playoff Jimmy grew three sizes that day (game 7). It was so engaging that I was actively fighting my first and only mushroom trip in order to watch the end of it.


GSW/Boston- it da finals what do u want from me. Also on a scheme level the way the series progresses is fascinating || Poole and klay were really important for that's series they do || Curry in the playoffs that year was on another level. That was particularly true against the Celtics.

I think that was the best basketball Curry ever played. Just utterly unstoppable against an incredible defensive team. || Digressing on a very minor point, but…

CP3 went 14/14 IIRC - the “perfect game”. 

I watched it live and it was pretty cool. He would go to his sweet spot basically every time and swoosh it from there

Edit: It was like an old videogame, where you put the player on the right spot and it’s guaranteed || Booker missed half the Pelicans series. That's why it was so close. That series probably ends in 5 with him healthy, but CP3 needing to carry against the 8th seed Pels with no Zion really highlighted the direction the team was going. It was the closeout game 6 where he probably had his last superstar type performance. 



The Suns really hinged on CP3's ability to create and lead the team's offense. While Booker may have been the ""best player"" and ceiling raiser, the team ultimately came and went with CP3, and he just vanished after going up 2-0 against the Mavs. It's hard to say if it was choking, game planning by the Mavs to tire him out on defense, or somehow falling off a cliff with age after one series. Criticisms of Ayton being soft started to surface when he couldn't dominate the Mavs weak front court. 



The 2022 playoffs also gets a bad rap for ""being weak"" because Khris Middleton (Celtics killer) was out for the Bucks/Celtics series which the Bucks pushed to 7 and probably still should've won without Middleton. I think it also had to do with the narrative that Tatum can't be ""the guy"" after getting locked down by Andrew Wiggins || Poole and klay weren't that important for the finals... Kevon looney was more important than those guys || Yeah, he was great against the Celtics.

Thing is, i dont think neither he nor the rest of the team really hit their stride until the finals.

Lost in the talk about injuries to other teams is the fact that the Warriors had their issues too.

By the time the playoffs started Klay, Dray and Curry had played together as a trio for like 11 minutes total or something in the last three years. And Curry had been injured for a stretch. By the time the finals came around they were finding their groove. || 14/14 my god. I suppressed the number in my head because I was like “that can’t be right “ || Wow I completely forgot about Book being out for most of the 1/8 series || I know Phoenix had the best record that year, but what's forgotten is that the Warriors started the season 18-2. They were rolling, and then they got bit by the injury bug. Draymond missed a lot of time. Steph missed some time. Klay came back in February I think, and it took them time to adjust. The Warriors were the best team when all together and healthy.

Steph didn't actually have a great season by his standards. He shot a career low from three. He was on a prolonged mid-season slump right around the time that he broke the three point record. He didn't look to be fully back to form until the Finals... And then he was the best he's ever been. || Even IN the finals Dray and to a lesser extent Klay had issues darn near boil over. It’s a special mix of factors and close calls that makes any non-dominant contender a championship team IMO and that Warriors team is the perfect example of things going right ENOUGH internally and externally to get the job done || That injury probably also set them back going into the Mavs series where he couldn't erupt for 40 points when they needed it in those last two games. But at the same time, if we look at Booker's playoffs performances, he seems to fall in line more with a Lamarcus Aldridge type. He can go off and carry the team to 1-2 wins in a series, but not enough to will the team to a series win. That's my hot take on Booker, but I'm also not entirely unbiased || Klay came back 1/9/2022 [vid of his starting lineup announcement](https://youtu.be/VybXKjo3380?si=QnprNasAwUQ9ZQ2R)🥹


What’s silly is that was the first game Draymond functionally missed with a calf issue, which turned out to be a back/nerve issue, which he would manage though the playoffs || Great point - did not remember them starting 18 - 2. Steph career low is a good point too

I think they were gelling pretty well throughout the playoffs - the grizzlies series had some really good buckets

Maybe even better in the finals - but I thought it was really poor defensive scheming against curry || Check out these vids by Thinking Basketball’s Ben Taylor on why and how the Dubs coalesced and turned it up in the Finals:

Barring injury it would be almost unprecedented for teams as good as the Cavs and Thunder have been to not make the finals.

Cavs kept switching on to Hauser in that comeback. It'll be Holiday in the playoffs in that rotation. I think it's going to be a hell of a series. If both teams are healthy I'm still confident in Boston. || The East is a little boring to talk about because the conference championship will most likely be Cleveland vs Boston unless we get a massive upset, and both of them match well against anyone that would come out of the west. The West is more open so there’s more conversation to be had about them rn || The cavs have so many ways to win a game. They give everyone a chance to score then stick with who is hot. The #8 or 9 guy off the bench could come in and hit 4 threes cus everyone gets a chance to carry the team on a nightly basis.

For the cavs to waiver in the playoffs, it's not that their stars have an off-night shooting, it's if they have an off-night and keep trying to force it. DG and Mitchell are great, but they sometimes fall into that trap, that's when they look shaky. I feel like it's easier to defer to the next guys on the rotation in the regular season, playoffs might be harder to keep that sacrificial team ball going. But if they do, they'll be alright and can hang with absolutely anyone.

Kenny Atkinson has had success with basically every adjustment he's made so far, that's an X-factor that can't be counted out either || In my opinion cavs have the best all around team when it comes to each position complimenting each other, that addition of deandre hunter is what i think gets them over the hump. Gonna be a fun post season to watch || their bench is very consistent imo. Starters have shown up getting blown out (celtics game) and the bench is able to pull them back into it. The bench points differential was insane that game || As a Cavs fan, I firmly believe they are the real deal. 

The truth is the nuggets got alot of doubt two years ago, the Celtics got a ton of doubt last year.

The NBA discourse is so weird sometimes. If a team hasn't won then they can't win. Meanwhile winning back to back rings almost never happens, yet all champions become defacto favorites. I can't wait for the playoffs, I foresee a lot more talk about this team when they destroy their first two opponents compared to the way they played in the first round the last 2 years. || Craziest thing about the cavs is either that 1) they’re 45-0 when leading after 3 quarters (I may be off by 1 here - I know it was 44 in the last few days but not sure if there’s been 1 or 2 since then. Or 2) I believe they’re 40-1 when leading after the first quarter. Again I could be slightly off on the number but last I saw it was 36-1 about a week ago. 

This team is crazy good. || Their overall points differential says yes - like OKC, basically every single team around them has won the title 

You could argue the strength of their bench is less advantageous in the playoffs but they almost look “locked” for the ECF minimum and Mitchell plays well against Boston (he now has a higher points average than Jordan against them, it might be the highest all-time) || The Cavs are the real deal. I truly hope the injury bug doesn't come into play during the playoffs. I would so love to watch these teams duke it out at full strength. || People call the Cavs young but their starters average 5 seasons of playoff experience.  The Warriors went to the playoffs two seasons before their 14-15 title and didn't make it to the conference finals either year before dominating the league and winning in 14-15.  The idea that you have to get to the conf finals or finals and fail before winning is nnsense.

They may still lose because lots can happen in the playoff but people writing them off due to lack of 'proving themselves don't really have an argument. || There is no argument for them not being the real deal, but the series against the Celtics in the ECF is where they’re going to have to earn everyone’s respect. It’s hard to get that respect when you haven’t done it in the playoffs || The problem is that no matter how good your team is, you can very easily lose in the playoffs simply because one team is younger, has more playoff experience, is built better for playoff matchups, etc. no amount of regular season warrioring will ever convince me a team can evolve when shit hits the fan in a 7 game series. I'll believe it when I see it. || It’s the 2015 Atlanta Hawks effect.

They’re great in the regular season, and they were last season as well. But still end up coming short 2 years in a row, expecting a 3rd one this year too. || I think it all depends on Garland. His big leap forward this year is the main reason they've climbed to these heights, but I still have a bit of doubt over his performance in big games. 


In the 21-22 play-in, he had 34 PTS, 5 AST, and 6 TO on 63.8 TS% vs BKN but followed that up with 21 PTS, 9 AST, and 5 TO on 37.7 TS%


In their loss to NY, he averaged 20 PPG, 5 APG, and 3.6 TO on an OK 56.6 TS%.


Against ORL, he was pretty lackluster in G7. Then, he shot poorly against BOS (49.4 TS), although his passing was quite good.


That pattern held up against BOS this year. Overall, since Mitchell joined CLE, Garland hasn't shot well against the Celtics (49.7 TS in 15 games, counting playoffs).


CLE goes as far as their PG takes them. If he plays up to his All-NBA form this season, they can win the championship. || I don’t think people will take cavs serious until they make noise in the playoffs; maybe not even till they beat Boston in the playoffs. They’ve been doing historic things for the past 60 games, so whoever doesn’t believe they’re at least a “threat” to Boston in the east, they’re minds won’t change until they see it || Wow those are so impressive wins. Beating the magic by 40! What is that some kind of record? || Im skeptical just cause Mitchell has been in this situation before. Gotta wait for the playoffs to see what happens || The continuity they’ve had the past few years is paying off. It’s a good core with the right pieces || I think they're just below the Celtics. I imagine it'll be Celtics-Cavs in the ECF, and if the Celtics are missing Porzingus and White/Holiday, the Cavs probably win. || We’ll see how the young Cavs pan out. Great team regular season so far. See how it pans out. Being the #1 seed getting home court in the east is a plus. They might be like the Thunder last year. Love to see a Finals without the Celtics. It would be poetic if Lakers made it all the way just for Lebronze to lose to his hometown team. || I don’t know about being able to win the whole thing but they are definitely the best team in a series against the Celtics. Mobley and Allen have a field day with them when they play. || The talk has been about the Luka and Butler trades because those are the two biggest fanbases and really the only two teams that ESPN talks about at all.  But neither of those teams has any real chance to make it out of the second round.

The Cavs on the other hand (and the Thunder) are on pace to have one of the greatest regular seasons in the history of the game.  There have been only 13 teams to win 67 games in a season, and only 6 to win 68, and the Cavs and Thunder both have real chances to hit these marks.  The Cavs aren't really being talked about because they're in a small market, don't have a mega-star, and people believe that they won't be able to beat the Celtics.  That's a foolish notion imo.  The Cavs (and Thunder) are absolutely title contenders and we should be taking them both super seriously and discussing them at length.  The Warriors and Lakers are curiosities and not worth the amount of breath spent on them. || I think when things tighten up in the playoffs, Cavs  can struggle vs physical players. After watching the bucks game, they were mauling the bucks players with no fouls being called and getting a soft whistle on the other end. Once the physicality is raised even more. A backcourt of Mitchell and Garland might get exposed by the Jays or other teams with multiple big bodies (pause). Good thing for the Cavs is they matchup well vs most everyone in the east and their bench is best in the league. All the teams like the lakers, thunder, and Timberwolves that could give them fits are in the west. || I still feel they’re a piece away from championship contending.

Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-03-10,nbadiscussion,1j8tpx7,Dissecting the Lakers' defense,"If you have watched any NFL whatsoever over the last two decades, you have undoubtedly heard someone comment that former Patriots coach Bill Belichick always tried to “take away what an opponent does best.” I know I shouldn’t bring up a Boston team when discussing the Los Angeles Lakers, but coach JJ Redick has instilled something similar in his team this season. Sound tactics, buy-in from players, and a healthy dash of luck have cooked up something tasty in Hollywood.

They utilize all the buzzword-laden modern defensive principles: peel and scram switching, targeted help, free-safety play, tactical ball pressure, one-man zone principles, and multiple defensive looks to keep opponents guessing where and when the help will come from. The Belichickian end goal: the Lakers want to make opponents’ worst players beat them. It’s worked. Since January 15th, the [Lakers have had the best defense in the league](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=01/15/2025&end=10/15/2025).

\[As always when I do these breakdowns, I've included plenty of illustrative video clips. You can find them[ in-context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked) or linked in the post.\]

To paint a picture with video instead of words, check recent victories over the Clippers. First, watch how the team treats James Harden with the ball: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

Then, watch how they insult poor Kris Dunn when he has the rock: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

That’s cruel!

A higher-profile example came in LA’s much-ballyhooed victory over Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets, when the Lakers limited the big man to a paltry seven field goal attempts while enticing Russell Westbrook into leading the charge with 17.

The Nuggets game was instructive. Most teams in the league are comfortable helping off of non-threats, but rarely to LA’s degree. Watch this play: \[[video here\]](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)

When the ball inevitably finds Aaron Gordon wide-open beyond the arc, no Laker so much as stunts at the forward. Sure, Gordon drains it, but the Lakers have had far more success than failure with this strategy — teams have made [just 33% of their flings from deep](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/shots?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=01/15/2025&end=10/15/2025#tab-defense_shooting_accuracy) against LA since January 15^(th), second-lowest in the league.

Plenty of good fortune is involved in that number. The Lakers don’t have a magic voodoo doll they prick every time someone enters their shooting motion (probably). They steer the best looks toward weaker shooters, hoping to siphon the ball away from a team’s more efficient scorers, but that effect is likely overstated.

The stars have to play along, too. The Lakers held Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to just 33 combined points in LA’s victory over Boston in January; the Jays were *determined* not to let that happen in Round 2, as they were the only Celtics with double-digit shots in Boston’s victory this past weekend.

But the approach has generally worked. Karl-Anthony Towns: 3-of-13 shooting, 12 points. James Harden: 18-for-67 over four games. Steph Curry: 37 points, but on 35 tries (including 20 triples!). Anfernee Simons: 3-of-13 shooting, eight points. Anthony Edwards: 6-for-12, etc. etc.

A byproduct of this help-heavy scheme is that the Lakers give up a lot of threes — they’ve allowed opponents to shoot a greater-than-median share of three-pointers [22 times in their 26 games since January 15th.](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/14/gamelogs#tab-shooting_defense_freq) Defenses can only control so much once the ball takes flight, but the Lakers have enforced their will to the best of their ability.

Walling off stars’ driving lanes to allow more threes isn’t the only pitch; Redick has done a nice job tailoring his solutions to the opponent to take away strengths. In both games against Boston, for example, Redick has instructed the team’s defense to stick tighter to the Celtics’ bevy of shooters — Boston actually shot a *smaller* share of threes against the Lakers than their league-leading average in both recent games.

A more minor (but still important) note: Los Angeles has also dramatically improved its transition defense during this stretch. They were [dead last in transition defense](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/context?season=2024&seasontype=regseason&start=10/15/2024&end=01/14/2025#tab-defense_transition) on January 14th; since then, they’ve been 11th-best, the difference of roughly a layup per game.

Like all defenses, there are still areas of concern. Speedy guards have given LA problems, as Jalen Brunson, Tyrese Maxey, and Kyrie Irving have had success probing through the Lakers’ big, but relatively slow, defenders — when Jarred Vanderbilt isn’t on the court, waterbugs can flit around without much resistance.

Truthfully, though, that would be a bigger problem in the East than in the West. Los Angeles’ uniquely giant lineups are better equipped to handle their conference’s brightest lights. Even without a dominant center, the team can field a forest: LeBron James, Hayes, Dorian Finney-Smith, Vanderbilt, and Hachimura all have at least a little experience playing center. Add Doncic, and you have a truly Brobdingnagian core.

Size isn’t particularly advantageous unless the team puts in the effort. Redick pointed this out recently when he acknowledged that “there’s actually only one cheat code in the NBA, and that's playing hard.”

He’s right. Remember, we’re not far from the Lakers looking like *this*: \[[video hereo](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

Now, even Luka Doncic and The Ancient One are flying around like their pants have been sipping Red Bull.

Notably, Doncic’s [three best games by Defensive EPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/player/1629029/historical) have come as a Laker. Doncic is usually stationed on a non-threat, so Redick has encouraged him to play highwayman (as long as he doesn’t compromise the defensive shell too much): \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

James’ defense has similarly upgraded. Redick claims that LeBron is performing at an All-Defense level. I can’t go that far, as he’s still a little prone to ball-watching and picking his spots… but he sure is picking a lot *more* spots than he used to. Players are legitimately frightened of James, for good reason — he’s only faced 26 isos *all season,* giving up just 11 points!

But I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the defensive turnaround started around when the team traded for DFS and intensified with Vanderbilt’s return from injury in late January.

The DFS fit has been flawless. The Lakers have allowed [\-8.4 points per 100 possessions fewer](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/1134/onoff#tab-team_efficiency) when he’s on the floor, in the 96th percentile, and he has guarded nearly everyone for LA. [His top matchups](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627827/head-to-head) include every notable offensive name from Jokic to Tatum to Curry. He’s a try-hard who sets the tone for the Lakers. I’m particularly fond of his pell-mell close-outs: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

If Finney-Smith is a try-hard, Vanderbilt is the try-hardest. Every game, the man leaves skin on the floor laying out for loose balls: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

Vanderbilt’s brand of defensive freneticism — all waving hands, skittery feet, and heedless dives — has always freaked out opposing ballhandlers. Offensive limitations curtail his playing time, but that may be a blessing in disguise, as it allows Vanderbilt to consistently red-line his motor without blowing it out.

The rest of the crew has done their part, too. Thrust into a larger role by necessity, Hayes has been playing better than at any point in his career. Gabe Vincent and Jordan Goodwin are *dawged* on-ball defenders, and Redick has not been afraid to let them try their hands at switching onto centers despite their pint-guard size (see what I did there?). While rookie Dalton Knecht has struggled at times this season, he’s figured out how to mitigate his weakness within the scheme — and when he forgets, Redick has had no problem letting him learn from the pine.

With Doncic playing at least passably, and sometimes better than that, the team’s main defensive weak link has been Austin Reaves. While Reaves tries, he’s often caught too upright in his stance, losing the leverage to hold his ground. Bigger foes run through him like he’s break tape, and even similarly-sized opponents smash him with quick seals in the post: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

Smart help can mitigate this a bit. Look at this perfectly executed scram switch, in which Vanderbilt sprints over to replace Reaves as soon as the pass is in the air: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/dissecting-the-lakers-top-ranked)\]

Although Reaves isn’t good on defense, the Lakers are in pretty solid shape if he’s their fifth-worst defender at any given time. Frankly, it might be a positive for the Lakers to provide an alternative target to Doncic. Attacking the superstar can tire Doncic out or get him in foul trouble (something he’s struggled with at times).

Overall, this isn’t a top-one defense over a full season. The defensive shooting luck is real, and they’ve had a relatively easy schedule during this stretch. But nobody plays only cupcakes during a 26-game run. The Lakers have shown that they can sustain a high level of play with smart tactics and high effort.

However, without elite rim protection, the team’s margin for error is small. It shrank further with LeBron James’ recent injury.

Anthony Davis erased many of the team’s mistakes. Since the trade for Doncic, the team has responded by limiting gaffes, but everyone must be on a string. James might’ve been the most imposing paint presence the Lakers had left, although I don’t mean that to sound like high praise — the competition isn’t stiff. He certainly was the team’s best defensive communicator, barking orders from the backline. His absence for the next handful of games will stress LA’s defense. A poor showing against the G-League-tastic Nets last night wasn't a great start, and upcoming games against Milwaukee (twice), Denver (twice), and Phoenix promise to test the team further.

Still, the Lakers are fighting for a top-two seed in the West. They’ve been far better than I expected after the Doncic trade. While the defense may take a step back, the offense will almost inevitably improve as Doncic gains more familiarity with his teammates, which could accelerate with greater responsibility in James’ absence.

“Just shortcuts,” [Redick responded](https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/44201494) when asked about his team’s struggles against Brooklyn last night. “If you want to be a good team, if you want to win in the NBA, you have to do the hard stuff.” For nearly a third of the season, the Lakers have cut no corners.

Now, things get even harder. We’ll see if they're up for the challenge.

Its also Vando and DFS (and other players like Vincent returning to form and additions of Goodwin and Jeymison) getting the rest of the team fired up.

OKC already won 57 games, they are on pace to win 67 games and they will be the 1st seed. 

When Jokic won in 2022, Embiid played 51 games… || Luka has the volume stats, but Shai is pretty close with an all time great advanced stats season on top of that. Dude is putting up MJ level advanced stats. Luka was not anywhere the level of efficiency SGA has this season, so how you weigh that depends on you. || This really isn't that hard to understand. When someone is on a top seeded team and is putting up MVP numbers, they will win MVP basically every time. The only time players have won from lower seed, there was no real candidate on the top seeded teams.

Last year SGA and Jokic were on Top seeded teams, and Luka wasn't. So he didn't win. This year SGA is on a top seeded team and Luka and Jokic aren't. So SGA will probably win.

All of that is purely descriptive, I'm not saying that's how it should be. As it happens, I do think SGA is more deserving this year compared to Luka last year. OKC this year is lightyears ahead of dallas last year, SGA is significantly more efficient (both as a score and as a passer), and is the much better defender. || SGA this season has been better than luka last season. Traditional stats arent the only way we measure impact || This makes no sense, questions should be if jokic won this year then why didn't Luka win last year or why isn't sga winning if Luka didn't win last year because how many wins you get doesn't seem to have a consistent weight to it. 

Mvp has nothing to do with seasons prior and their numbers are arguably equally impressive if you look at per 75 numbers outside of playmaking which Sga arguably makes up with his defense. || And....here we go again!  Luka stans coming out the woodwork to say he was ""robbed"" with no argument other than ""bEtTeR sTaTs bRo"" c'mon man. || Luka having better box score numbers does not means he’s have a significantly better season. The same can be said for Jokic vs SGA this season. Too many people are using box scores to judge player impact.

Jokic won MVP as a 6th because his Murray missed the entire season and MPJ only played like 10 games. He carried a bad roster to almost 50 wins. The other issue was that Giannis and Embiid’s teams won a similar amount of games as the Nuggets. Hard to knock Jokic for only winning 48 games and give it to Embiid or Giannis who only won 51 games. If Embiid or Giannis wins 55+ games or are 1st in the East they win MVP IMO. || Holy casual, so many people like you just think basketball is about padding counting stats. My god. || Jokic is the darling of today fans because everyone nowadays is stat watching without context. They see a triple double and they start to salivate


Luka almost had a triple double average, that's not good enough || Well in 2022 when Jokic won as a 6th seed (48wins) the next top vote getters were. Embiid (4 seed, 51 wins) Giannis (3 seed, 51 wins) and Devin Booker (1 seed, 64 wins).

Let's be real Booker was never winning MVP. The other 2 played in a much easier conference and only managed 3 more wins. While Giannis and Embiid outscored Jokic by a few points he made up for it in rebounding and assists. That's only using traditional stats, I bet the advanced stats probably favored Jokic too. || https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_leaders.html

Here, take a look at a part of it yourself. Joker was just better. || 1. Team Success Matters More Than Individual Stats

2023, Luka put up MVP-level numbers (32.4 PPG, 8.6 RPG, 8.0 APG), but the Mavericks finished 38-44 and missed the playoffs after tanking the last few games.

Meanwhile, this year, SGA’s Thunder are one of the top teams in the West, and team success has historically been a major factor in MVP voting.

2. Narrative & MVP Fatigue

Last year, Nikola Jokić and Joel Embiid had the strongest MVP narratives—Jokić was going for a three-peat, and Embiid was seen as overdue. Luka didn’t have a compelling storyline behind him.

This year, SGA is the rising star leading OKC’s unexpected surge, which strengthens his case.

3. Defensive Impact & Two-Way Play

SGA is one of the best defensive guards in the league, ranking high in steals and deflections.

Luka, despite his offensive brilliance, has never been a strong defender. Last season, the Mavs’ defense was terrible, and he bore some responsibility.

So, the main difference is team success, defense, and narrative. If the Mavericks had won 50+ games last year, Luka likely would’ve been a top-2 MVP candidate. This season, SGA checks all the boxes—elite individual play, a top-seeded team, and a strong narrative—so his case is stronger than Luka’s was in 2023. || > but he's an all timer so people turn a blind eye

People don't turn a blind eye to other all-time players tho || [deleted] || To put it into perspective, Luka was 7 games back from the #1 seed last year. The Nuggets are 12.5 games back from the #1 seed this year. Thats how well SGA is performing || Not about stats it's about the narrative changing, the prob is OP should've asked this when joker was leading the MVP race a few weeks ago. 


The question holds better when we ask why joker won it as a 6th seed and Luka with numbers similar to Shai this year on a worse team didn't sniff it. No one thinks Lula should win but it was a landslide in jokers favor. Every year the narrative changes to support joker winning, shai is just blowing everyone out the water and look how much he's had to do in the last 3 weeks to get a slight lead.  || You also forget that Giannis already had 2 mvp. Voter fatigue is real and that's what happened to Joker too. TBH, Joker probably won't win a 4th unless he has a monster season and his team is 1st. || The real casual ""never touched a basketball in their life"" take is that you can stat pad 34 points and 10 assists in the NBA.

Fuck Nico. || [removed] || Kid? He is in his prime currently, this is his peak

He is the same age as Brandon Ingram lol || [removed] || I think he'll make an all star appearance and the LA media market will definitely give him a boost, he may even become a regular all star off it as Luka' #2.  I think he could maybe get to a Zach Lavine level with elite scoring, but not a lot of self creation and subpar defense which keeps him from being a top tier player.  Zach's a 2 time all star, but has played in mostly small market middling teams, if he was in LA he'd have many more appearances. || He's one of my favourite stories in terms of his growth as a player. When he started off, he was on a 2 way contract after he was undrafted (although apparently because he declined to be drafted at 42). But as soon as he got on the floor, he just seemed to have the perfect attitude. He seemed to just take every lesson thrown his way and found a way to improve. And whenever it looks like he reaches the limit of his talent, he adds some more to what he does. And now he seems to be adding responsibility to his play. 

It's extremely impressive in a sport where so many players either have it, or they don't. I'm not sure he's quite got it in him to be an all-star, but he probably doesn't need to improve much more to be a genuinely worthy selection. At the moment though, I think he's a clear step behind those who are already on the cusp. || His only weakness is he's been a below average defender & he still isn't great but his offensive play making is really on another level at times. He's a imaginative passer & great shot maker. Really good at the line. He gets lost in the offense when Luka & LeBron are out there but he's good enough to always impact the game without having the ball || I think this is his peak offensively. He says he grew up playing point guard and we're seeing that now with his playmaking, handles and shot creation. His body control is underrated. He can finish around the basket in a variety of ways. 

Defensively, he's not a headless chicken out there. He's smart enough to be in good defensive positions but is just overpowered by bigger players but that's true for everyone. He's tall for a PG so that helps. 

All star? I don't think he's there yet but when he is, the Lakers white guy tax might hurt his popularity among other voters. To their eyes he's just another hyped white guy who plays on the Lakers. || Reaves has added something to his game every year so far. He’s taken a playmaking leap and no longer dribbles into traffic with his head down forcing silly passes as much. He also has a lesser defensive role this season since the team’s defensive personnel are actually healthy (Vando/Gabe) and they’ve added more wing defenders. All his job is this year is to put the ball in the basket and make good reads. JJ has given him the most touches since Kobe and Lakers LeBron, so that may inflate his production but he’s still relatively efficient regardless. There are players who produce more with less touches but Reaves has a borderline all star case but it’s like Jamal Murray. Guard voting is just too packed. || Dude is averaging 19 ppg as a 3rd option and we've seen what he's capable of when he's the 2nd and when he's the 1st. He's an all star || around this part of the season, you'll get good players having stretches where they're putting up ridiculous numbers. also, luka is absolutely having quite the impact on reaves. they are not at odds with one another offensively whatsoever. we'll see how long this lasts. i would love to see him become an all star next season. i would bet on it, but who knows || Reaves is an incredible player already, could see him taking another step if he continues to develop his strength. Currently has a pretty weak frame, you see him lose balance when stronger guys push him around a lot. It works regular season because he has a really friendly whistle, but it will make things tough for him come playoff time. || As a lifelong Laker fan, I knew he was a special player when he took over the 4th quarter and OT against Denver two years ago. People just don't 'luck' into playing that way. That was the game I told all my friends and family that Reaves was 'the one'.

Of course his stats are borderline all-star, but I don't think stats really do justice to his impact on the court. The Lakers are so dangerous with him out there because he's a threat one-on-one, on the screen and roll, and also off-ball as well. He can literally play any style of basketball and do well. That's why he plays well with LeBron/Luka and even without them. I bet you if he played on a team like the Wizards or Hornets, his numbers would be mind boggling.

But I think besides all this debate about how actually good he is in the league right now, the most important thing to Lakers fans is that he's literally the best 3rd guy we've had in many years, possibly 25+ years.

I have to honestly say he's significantly better than Eddie Jones (who was a 3x all-star and my favorite player growing up) even though Eddie was considered one of the better defensive guards in the league at the time. He's better than Van Exel (1x all-star). He's better than Michael Cooper, Byron Scott, AC Green. He's much, much better than all these guys, too: Fisher, Fox, Horry. Fisher was routinely one of the worst point guards in the NBA. He was clutch from time to time, but his negatives in the regular season outweighed his clutch shots. Horry was often a terrible defender, especially in the regular season and would routinely hack players. Fox was a solid, solid role player all around, but he's not on Reaves level.

The only ones that I would say from a '3rd' guy perspective that might have been better than Austin are Lamar Odom and Worthy. But even those two are nowhere near Reaves offensively.

Suffice to say that this is a special dude, especially for Lakers fans. I think what he has become is super underappreciated because we are comparing him to all-stars across the league, but we just really have to put into perspective what he means to the franchise. He's legit one of the best role players ALL-TIME for the Lakers, and I don't think that's hyperbole. || Neither

Can get better but 0% chance he gets an all star game in the west the next 2-3 years 

Still can get better and all that but I highly doubt 1) the lakers will be good enough for 3 all stars and 2) his stats will be good enough to justify it 

Elite role player or great 3rd best player, below Powell, white/kp, garland/mobley/hunter, and Chet off the top of my head, probably arguments for others || Reaves is a great player, borderline all star, but if you’re implying you’d take him over Luka, there’s a Mavs front office that’s hiring || Y’all talk about reaves only excelling because he’s the third option.. every game that LeBron/ad were injured or now bron/luka sitting out he drops 30+ and takes the game over. Celtics game last year without bron and ad? Bro went into Boston and dropped 30+ won the game, almost single handed beat the nuggets the other night with a line up looking like what the Wizards drag out to the court every night. (That being said nuggets lost to the wizards right after lol) 
Reaves is him, j think playing w LeBron made his ceiling a little higher because he’s learning game from the goat. 
But I think we have enough evidence to say he’s really him. when he’s the #1 option he goes nuts every time. 
Add in the clutch and dawg and man he’s just fucking phenomenal, end rant tldr I fuckin love Austin || Austin Reaves isn't at the Havlicek, Jerry West, Chris Mullin, and Pete Maravich level of white American shooting guards. But he's already comparing favorably to Jeff Hornacek (1x All Star). If Reaves keeps playing for JJ, I think he can become an All-Star and maybe more. I think the playing style and freedom suits him.

Oddly, the player Austin Reaves reminds me of the most is Bobby Sura [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDcPpe6Jz08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDcPpe6Jz08) Bobby Sura just got stuck with anti-fun coach Mike Fratello. I really think he would have had a different career if he didn't spend his first 4 years dealing with Fratello's nonsense. Sura was talented enough to do the 3 point contest and the dunk contest. It was all there, but he got drafted to the worst possible coach of his era. As a reminder... he got fired multiple times for running the worst style of offense in the NBA.

>Ding, dong, the witch is dead. The Cleveland Cadavers have fired Mike Fratello. Goodbye, StallBall. Good riddance.

>Few have done more to ruin professional basketball than Fratello. He introduced that control-freak, slowdown style and had mild success with it. StallBall spread through a copycat league like the plague.

>We don't have anyone specifically to blame for the fact that NBA players can't shoot anymore or NBA teams don't run anymore. At least we have Fratello. He is the root of the insidious offense disguised as defense, designed to milk the clock and keep the scores low - and therefore close.

It’s simple he can create his own shot and knocks down shots when open. 

He a “small star” on Lakers for sure but not on any other team where teams would be the main focus on the scouting report. Just look at Jordan Poole. || He's becoming a Khris Middleton-type player, which is to say he could make an all-star or two. being in LA probably helps in that regard. || I’m still of the opinion that cone playoff time we might realize that backcourt doesn’t fit, but based on play…. Lakers gonna end up with an elite big lol || He's not a future Hall of Famer, imo, but he's a very solid star.

Really shows that teams aren't that great at assessing prospects after the 1st 2 rounds of the draft.

I also if wonder if more players wouldn't benefit from longer college careers. A guy like James Wiseman just wasn't ready for the NBA. || When bro retires and he’s the number 2 to doncic, maybe. It’s also the west so it’s a bit tough || He’s growing so fast. It’s amazing. I think he is best value contract for his production in the league. || His ceiling I could see him being a Kris Middleton klay thompson type. A really good player that can take over games 

His floor would be prime Mike miller in Orlando/memphis || I think Lebron is sharing his alien juice with him.  He keeps getting better and better.  I can definitely see his defense getting better with his quickness. || I think when you look a reaves skillset the ability to drive and get free throw opportunity. The efficiency at all three levels.   The playmaking and ability to make variety of type of passes. || I think he’d be just below All Star level if he was a full time first option. || Honestly, he just reaps the benefit of having bron/ad around him and now bron/luka around him. 

Would likely be mid at best on a bad team || If Lakers happened to be the #1 seed leading up to all star weekend next year, I think he could definitely make it. If Darius Garland can be an All Star then AR is worthy 

There’s not much I can add that you haven’t already said; we know he’s good enough. He keeps showing up and having big games. If he continues this through the rest of this season, and keeps it going throughout the Lakers entire postseason run, I think the hype will be there for him to be an all star. || I like reaves I think he’s a great player but I don’t know if he’s a top 50 player. He has had good scoring games but is he an elite scorer? He’s had games where he’s been a great playmaker but is he an elite playmaker. No. He’s definitely a blow average defender.

Hard to imagine the Lakers and Celtics going to finals 9 times between the two of them in a decade or whatever it was.  || Tbh, Luka doesn't match up well against the Celtics. Long wing defenders and a well-rounded team is perfect against his playstyle. As they are now, it'd take an increase in talent on the Lakers and other players stepping up to match the Celtics, but then you may not get that superstar rivalry narrative going on. || I think the lakers spurs rivalry is the far more likelier to be revived to it's full extent. || I mean if the lakers and Celtics start going to the finals every year sure, but I doubt it actually happens. || Two words: Jordan Brand. 

This will 100% be a renewed rivalry with both Jordan guys Luka and Tatum at the center. || Wouldn't say Luka layed an egg he was the leading scorer on a bum knee, it was a better first finals showing than alot of other stars have had || Yes, because these guys will be on their respective teams for the next decade.  Plus Luka already played the Celtics in the Finals, so there’s bad blood there. || >Can Luka & Tatum bring the Laker/Celtic rivalry to where it used to be?

Which is probably the exact question Adam Silver asked himself before he met with the Adelons about setting up their casino arena. || Bu bu bu bu bu but back then the white guy was on Celtics and the black guy with lakers || The league certainly hopes so and I wouldn’t put it past Silver to try everything legal (and a few illegal things) to ensure Finals are Lakers vs Celtics, especially considering LBJ is still playing in LA.

Luka can be heated on the floor, but is very shy and respectful off the floor. Tatum is generally respectful (can do some corny things here and there though), so I don’t think we would see genuine bad blood between players, but I’m sure fans would tune in just fine. || Nah. It’s a different world now. The NBA will never be like it was back in the day. Options for entertainment were limited - couple that with NBA being a main focal points of that era, especially in the playoffs back then on tv, well, it just can’t be replicated. It’s a different era of basketball and options for entertainment - it’s not five channels available anymore where you’re captivated by a sporting drama. The multitude of viewing options and genre now outside the NBA and sports is ever-growing and exponentially rising. || No let it go new rivalries are here change is a normal part of life you're only torturing yourself || Before, it felt weird when they were marketing the Lakers-Celtics games in this era because LeBron and AD were older stars from previous generations, while the Jays were much younger. Luka gives the Lakers a star from the same generation, and he's met the Celtics in the Finals as well, which makes this rivalry feel more like a rivalry. || I don’t think so. Lakers probably take a year to become consistent contenders(ignoring Luka’s potential health issues lol), and the celtics have a timeline with all the massive contracts they have given out. Pretty sure the celtics almost require a blow up to some degree in the next couple years due to salary. They are 20m past the 2nd apron next season and the season after they are pretty much at the luxury tax with no center contracts on the books. Iirc celtics ownership isn’t rich enough to pay all that tax. || Tatum and Boston have proven they can make the finals. It would only be a rivalry if Luka and the Lakers can do likewise. The window for the Lakers to make the finals is very small, once Lebron retires the lakers will have a very hard time rebuilding their roster to contender-status, even with Luka. The next 3-8 years in the west will likely be dominated by OKC, HOU, and maybe a couple other young teams. There will be very little opportunity for the lakers to force their way back into that upper-echelon of teams and I don't know if Luka is good enough to carry a so-so roster to the finals against his likely competition. || I think it’ll be Bron and Luka vs brown and Tatum. Bron will be the Kareem to lukas magic || I don't think there's a chance of it. Rivalries happen because a lot of talent sits in a few teams. In the 80s Magic and Kareem were perpetually top 5 first team picks in the same side. Bird was a long way Boston's best player but McHale, Parrish and Ainge were pretty darn good.

More recently we had Golden State and LeBron, but that was because Golden State were a heck of a side that picked up Durant and LeBron was just a force all on his own, but also attracted serious talent wherever he went. 

You can't replicate the conditions of the 80s. And big rivalries between teams are getting harder and harder to establish as the league achieves more parity. || The problem is that C's fans generally love Luka's game. It will be hard to actually hate him so that will limit the depth of the rivalry. || [deleted] || Yeah as long as Luka stays healthy and Boston has the best roster in the entire league || That level of on the court vitriol is basically dead. Both Luka and Tatum are relatively laid back guys as well.

He was playing hurt and gutted it out. Also, the Laker / Celtic rivalry has to do with whether the Lakers can contruct a team around Luka.

Semifinals, Western Conference Finals, NBA finals?

#Realism

You rarely see teams in which their best 2 players just came together make deep runs in the postseason.

At best, a semifinals appearance would be an achievement.

#Delusion

Lakers have a lot of championships in team history (17). The Warriors have won the most championships in the last decade (4).

That’s as far as the championship talk should go for these 2 organizations this year.

Cavaliers, Thunder and Celtics (the only 3 teams in the 50-Win club so far) should be the clear favorites to win the title.

#Nostalgia

Would a postseason be more entertaining featuring Curry/Butler & James/Doncic?

For most NBA fans, absolutely!

Worth seeing the bracket before making a call I guess but I’d feel confident picking them. || I’ll admit I was wrong about Jimmy on the Warriors (I just didn’t think he would have the impact he’s had) but I’m still going the Lakers. Fact of the matter is you’re running two once-in-a-lifetime offensive talents and it is incredibly difficult to beat a team like that 4 out of 7 times. || Lakers. Matchup hunting is more effective for the most part and they have both Lebron and Luka, who are the probably the 2 best ever matchup hunting players ever. Both teams have massive roster flaws, with both being generally pretty small. The Lakers other main advantage is that Luka and Bron both need the same type of player to guard them, its highly unlikely for a team to have 2 of them. || Lakers have more overall talent imo, but playoffs are all about matchups. It’s very possible the answer to this question is just who has the best path || When healthy? I’d say warriors shouldn’t be underestimated.

I’m basing this on a recent vid I saw which mentioned Phil Jackson’s book. That there’s 5(?) types of teams and at the pinnacle is “zen teams.”  These zen teams, like the 2014 Spurs, play as one organism. 

You don’t have to worry about your own shot when you trust your team mates as an extension of yourself. Jimmy and Draymond definitely embody this level of play. They’re also high IQ.

The thing is, Lakers have LeBron & Luka who are also very high IQ. Likely more so.

So individually, Lakers have more talent, generational star power.

But Warriors seem to have already figured out who they are. Which is shocking since the Jimmy trade just happened. Usually it takes a minute for teams to gel. This tells me that a strong system exists in the warriors and Jimmy has already bought in.

Will be interesting to see. || Im biased but lakers. Luka and lebron can both takeover games and as long as the role players perform and nobody is injured i think the lakers can beat anyone. A healthy squad next year with more bigs will make them contenders imo. Also reaves is insane, there are only a few third options in the league that can also take over like him || Personally lakers, LeBron and Luka are too good of a match, and their prospective sub doesn’t clown their own coach saying that they need to go. Reddick has done nothing but make him and his team take accountability every time. When you’re playing the same team to four wins; I think that matters the most. || lakers are the better team but i don't see neither of them beating denver or okc || I value playoff experience a lot. The teams that go far are the ones with stars that have been there before. Every year, the experienced teams are the ones that cause the most upsets. 


Other than Denver and Phoenix, the West is pretty young. I honestly could see either of these teams sneaking through into the Western Conference finals. OKC probably wins, but their lack of playoff experience is a big question mark for them.  || who ever of the two stays more healthy. players like vando, dfs, and even hayes are crucial for the lakers to make a deep run. the warriors core is obviously older, and really important to the team || As a Celtic fan with equal hate to both teams, it’s a toss up. Warriors got a better system but I think the lakers got a deeper/ more experienced team 

warriors top 3 can certainly out grind more inexperienced teams and get away with a lot of 50/50 calls 

Honestly think they’re both likely second round exits, with the lakers likelier to lose to the thunder in the WCF || The Warriors. The Lakers have no front court whatsoever and Luka gets exposed on D in the playoffs. Plus I trust Jimmy and Steph in the post-season. || [removed] || The more Reaves handles the ball, the deeper LA will go and the more they distance themselves from GS.  GSW doesn’t have a role player with Reaves’ impact, the way Reaves creates the kinda vortex of greatness around key pieces like LeBron and Doncic.  Doncic gotta keep with the flow, tho. || Honestly, my opinion is that this is all much ado about nothing.  I think it's likely both teams end up in the bottom of the bracket and don't make it out of the first round.  I think it's very likely GSW ends up in 6th and gets beat.  The Lakers could be in the 4-5 and win that, but OKC will not be beaten in the West. || Gotta go with the warriors. I believe playoff jimmy who carried a team to the finals still exists, and this is the best team he’s been on || I think it will heavily depend on who wins more games in their respective series.

That will ultimately determine who will go further in this years playoffs. Who knows?! Both might make it equally as far || I think both of these teams lack rim protection and would normally be exposed in the playoffs. Making them at best second round exits. Neither team would typically go to the WCF.

However, the NBA this season has been probably the worst reffed season in recenty memory. We all know that both of these teams are going to have a favored whistle against teams like the Rockets, Wolves, Grizzlies, or Clippers. || If the west standings stay the same, the Lakers first round matchup looks way better than the Warriors. Lakers would play Memphis and would win easily IMO, while the Warriors would play the Nuggets and would lose the series easily. || I don’t think either team is going far but the Warriors have the potential to be first round exits with how poorly Jimmy has shot the ball since the trade and how hot and cold Steph has been at times this season shooting his 3s, I don’t think that’s happening to a Luka / Lebron team || The Warriors have been on a YO-YO ride all season. If they can time it right, they would have as a chance of anyone winning it all. If not, they run the chance of not evening making it to a play-in game. || I mean, technically the playoffs won’t have any bad teams for Lakers to lose to, as it seems like they beat most good teams, and lose to every bad team… || Probably LA. They are the fifth seed and one game away from clinching the third seed away from the Nuggets. If that happens and the warriors are a play in who have to face OKC first round then….goodbye Warriors in a tough six game series. OKC too tough for them in a 7 game series. || I can see the lakers in the finals. 

I can’t see warriors past round 1 MAYBE 2. || As the bracket looks right now, it's Lakers vs Warriors. Lebron has a good history against Steph in the playoffs when Steph didnt have KD. And he has Luka now too. So im thinking it's going to be Lebron in this case. I see the Lakers going to the 2nd round, possibly WCF and then stopping there. || NBA season and NBA playoffs are 2 different beasts. More so than any other sport. While NVA is a team sport, it’s also one where ONE good player can carry a team. Just look at the LeBron Cavaliers to see how true that is.

I say this because there are VERY few players who can carry a team like that. And the Lakers got TWO of them. 

Luka alone could take Lakers deep into the playoffs. LeBron alone could take Lakers deep into the playoffs.

Them just turning the switch on come playoffs and dominating is really not out of the question.

Hell look at who Luka took to the finals last year. Now he had a seemingly ageless LeBron on his team too? These guys gonna win the title. || Neither should be favored to win.
But both could under the right circumstances. || Doubt either team will make it past the 2nd round.  Lakers have 3 starters who are bad defenders. When teams game plan for them, I think they are in huge trouble.  
Gsw offense depends on curry who can be real streaky.  When he goes cold for a couple games they will be done. || Lakers had an 8 game winning streak where they were winning by 2 points over the clippers and just lost by 30 to the Bulls with LeBron back. They’re playing Alex Len serious minutes. Golden state had been the best team by net rating since the trade deadline until curry got injured. Playoff success comes down to more than 2 players lol, but frankly I think both teams ultimately get crushed by OKC in a 7 game series. Neither is an actual great team, warriors got a bit more depth and balance at least. || Warriors aren't as good as they're looking right now. They went against a lot of weak or injured teams or teams they are better in matchups. They're not getting passed 2nd round and they better not run into lakers bc they'll get destroyed.

Im a D1 certified lebron and lakers hater with a PhD in the matter but a healthy lakers can easily get to the CF. 

My bet is on lakers especially since a lot were just injured but took a long rest. Lebron needed that all star and groin injury rest. He's gonna look good the following weeks

It’s a historic amount of DPOYs, and he’s having a mid season by his standards. statistically, he should be in the mix for it though. || Rudy is probably a top 5 defender in the league, but he has also clearly taken a huge stepback from last year. There's been very few games this year where he just dominates on the defensive end and is a massive presence for the Wolves. || He's still a really good defender but his stats and advanced nerd stats are down as well as Minnesota winning less games this year and having a lower team defensive rating. || because Nic Batum made one open three that one time, the narrative energy now dictates that Gobert is a defensive liability who can easily scored on if you just have someone shoot threes. || [deleted] || gobert was NEVER a truly a TRUE DPOY player. he just happened to play on a defensively strong team. if you watch the season when he ""won"", when he went up against an elite offensive player, he sucked balls on defense.

The Wolves last year were a historically good defense and Rudy played extremely well in all 3 playoff series for them. Hes been pretty good against elite offensive players, watch his defense against KD when they got matched up in the Suns series and he has the best record against Jokic of any player ever.

Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-03-24,nbadiscussion,1jjgcky,If Jordan continued playing the way he did in 1988…,"
Jordan was averaging career highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks under Doug Collins. He won dpoy. He was at minimum the 2nd best individual player of all time (Wilt has a strong case for the top spot). He won the MVP… but he wasn’t the best player in the world & if that continued he would NEVER be the goat. It wouldn’t matter if he teamed up with Hakeem and Drexler winning 6 titles. He wasn’t playing wining basketball. 

Under Doug Collins MJ played like LeBron, Luka, Harden. Give him the ball at the top of the key and spam ISO’s and pnr. He was doing everything. It was EASY for the defense to defend Jordan WITH the ball. That was their entire focus. Blitz, trap, double team.. force someone else to beat you.. It looked like he had no help.

Under Phil, he learned how to be a winner. Actually dominating basketball games while scoring less, rebounding less, assisting less.. steals and blocks down.. but he was dominating more… and working even harder. The defense now needed to stop the ball primarily.. and worry about Jordan secondarily. You can’t double off ball.. so Jordan was able to come off screens and go up immediately… before the double team got there. Small guy on him.. he could post up.. go up immediately before the double got there. No good looks? He didn’t even need to do anything, just catch the ball.. wait patiently for the double team.. and become a decoy.. allowing his team to play 4v3. 
Now he had arrived as the best in the world..

The isolation, ball dominance gets you the most stats..and makes the best individual players.. but that doesn’t make the best basketball players if we’re focused on winning games.

Most of us know that MJ sacrificed stats and control when the Bulls implemented the triangle, and yes that happened around the same time he began winning titles. However, many people point out that Pippen’s ascent to complementary star also coincided with that timeframe. Which may or may not have been a result of MJ taking a step back. And that the Bulls’ role players also developed to the point that both Horace Grant and BJ Armstrong were all-stars by 1994. Again, maybe due to MJ sharing the load, but maybe not. 

There is also the issue that the game was played in a very different way in those days, which made heliocentric offenses less effective. There was much more limited spacing, and few guys who could team up on pick and rolls. Instead of modern, athletic bigs springing for lobs or popping to the three point line, you had awkward bruisers who often preferred scoring on inefficient isos. And collapsing the defense only to kick out for an 18 footer is not a good strategy long term. 

Today, outside of Steph Curry, who is a singularly dangerous off ball threat, there just doesn’t seem to be a path to winning by intentionally keeping the ball out of your best shot creator’s hands. The game is exhausting enough that adding additional less impactful duties to your star is going to offer diminishing returns. KD is probably a good example of this- he plays a bit like triangle era MJ, more by necessity than design, as his inability to lean further into heliocentrism seems to hamper his impact.

I’m not necessarily discounting your narrative. I think it’s actually quite possible that it’s still correct. The triangle is a rather fascinating anomaly in the history of the league, and it’s significant that its principles contributed to teams winning nine titles in 12 years. I’m still not sure if that’s due to superior X’s and O’s or merely the way it allowed Phil Jackson to pull his zen master voodoo on his teams’ egos. || [removed] || > He was at minimum the 2nd best individual player of all time

He was on that trajectory sure but after a 5 year career, he wasn't yet definitely better than Bird, Magic, Kareem, Wilt, or Russell if he had stopped right there.

> but he wasn’t the best player in the world & if that continued he would NEVER be the goat. It wouldn’t matter if he teamed up with Hakeem and Drexler winning 6 titles. He wasn’t playing wining basketball.

I'm not convinced. He did have some lessons to learn about when to feed his teammates - e.g. Phil Jackson's famous ""Who's open, Michael?"" moment - but a big difference really was that he had better teammates around him. I think 1987-1990 MJ still wins 5-6 rings if you put him on the same Bulls team from 1991-1993 and 1995-1998. He was more heliocentric because he kind of had to be, but he was still creating plenty beforehand and sometimes it looked like he had no help because he really didn't have that much of it. || [removed] || [removed] || [removed] || It has nothing to do with the triangle specifically. The Spurs ran a 3 point motion offense. The 60 win Hawks under Budenholzer same thing. The Celtics don’t just put it in Tatums hands and watch. 

Any system works… as long as the superstar (teammates follow) buys in.

Anyone watching how Jordan played realizes he made a conscious effort to get his teammates involved and build their confidence. He needed them, he needed to be able to to trust them, and he had to nurture and develop them first. 

Bill Russell has a famous quote
“The most important measure of how good a game I played was how much better I'd made my teammates play”

That was how Jordan was playing now, more concerned with the production he could get out of his teammates. He accepted double teams, became a decoy.. and picked defenses apart, giving teammates 2v1 on the weak side. He took over when games got close, but he was using his teammates as much as possible, and trying to let them have the show. || Lebron plays a very heliocentric style of basketball. He spammed ISO’s when he was younger, now he spam’s pick and rolls until he gets a switch and then he spams ISO’s… because that’s what every heliocentric superstar does in the NBA today. 

He’s very similar to Doug Collins MJ.. he’s just not the same shot creator.. and obviously not the same defender but he was elite in his early Cavs days too. Where they truly dominate is transition basketball..not so much half court. || That’s why said “individual player” he was better than those guys other than Wilt individually. He wasn’t better as a team player. Bird and Magic were clearly still better players than him. 

Jordan built those guys confidence. He made a conscious effort every game, all season long to allow his teammates to do as much as possible. He started games getting them involved, He built leads for them by taking over, he accepted double teams, rotated the ball and let them play 2v1… he was getting guys emotionally invested and helping them build their confidence… that lead to them giving more consistent effort instead of standing around watching him.

The famous Bill Russell quote
“The most important measure of how good a game I played was how much better I'd made my teammates play.”

Jordan played that way and was a completely different player..that’s why his teammates looked so much better. They developed those habits all season long. || We don't allow posts on player rankings or player comparisons on this subreddit.

You are taking a very narrow look at certain stats and using them to paint your  narrative without painting the whole picture. There were more assists per game in Jordan's 8 assist season than any season of the first 17 seasons of Lebron's career. Pace was also significantly higher for that season than all of Lebron's save for 2. || We don't allow posts on player rankings or player comparisons on this subreddit.

lenitently progressively since the 60’s. So the late 80’s was far more lenient than the 60’s and this era is far more lenient than this era. Meaning he would have had more if they were scored by today’s statisticians. 

Pace is a completely different topic, but nice deflection. Lebron has had 2 seasons with a higher pace than 88 you say. So did Jordan have more than 2 seasons with a higher pace than 88? Whose career has had a higher average pace. Both favor Jordan. Even when you try to make up a completely new topic, it fails. 

This wasn’t to be a comparison about these 2 guys, it’s about the heliocentric playing style being bad basketball even though it produces better statistics for the individual player. || Jordan has routinely said Moncrief and Dumars were the best defenders he ever faced. That was from that era. They also had Jordan himself and Michael cooper in that era. The defenders were just as quick.

Maybe you’re thinking because they were bigger, they were slower. Which is true, but those weren’t guards. They had guys like Oakley, Rodman, and Larry Bird playing SF when they would be PFs and Centers today.. so yeah they are obviously slower laterally and the centers are slower laterally.. but that wouldn’t help a guy that wants to score his points at the rim. That makes it more difficult. || > That’s irrelevant.. everyone with any basketball knowledge realizes that assists have been scored more lenitently progressively since the 60’s.

Pace and PPG directly affect assists. ""everyone with any basketball knowledge realizes this"". 

>Lebron has had 2 seasons with a higher pace than 88 you say. So did Jordan have more than 2 seasons with a higher pace than 88? Whose career has had a higher average pace.

Again, more made up stats. Pace during Jordans 15 years is actually higher than the pace over Lebron's career. 

>This wasn’t to be a comparison about these 2 guys, it’s about the heliocentric playing style being bad basketball even though it produces better statistics for the individual player.

Yeah but even your descriptions of how players are used has been incorrect on top of your stats being wrong/misleading. || >  They had guys like Oakley, Rodman, and Larry Bird playing SF when they would be PFs and Centers today..

In what world was Oakley a SF? He was never a SF. Rodman also didn't play SF for the vast majority of his career. Bird also didn't really play SF until he hurt his back.

*\*excluding his first four games and last game in Dallas and excluding his first three games in LA*

It was expected that Luka would take some time to ramp up to his former self after coming off an injury, and his 3P shooting has cerrtainly reflected that: going from 30% in his first 10 laker games to an absurd 44% in his last 10.

However, his 2P% has not only cratered, but it's even further decreased further over time: going from 59.4% at Dallas to just 50% in his first 10 laker games and 42% in his last 10. These percentages are almost unfathomable given his track record/reputation as one of the leagues most diverse scorers,

# Possible explanations (i.e. I kind of bullshit for a bit because I don't have the numbers)

After recently watching a Daniel Li video with a [section about the Mavs-Wolves series last year](https://youtu.be/2MoMZiUYXzo?si=P74jquPqJ5VKxMpx&t=210) did it become clear that part of it seems to be that his methodical navigation and scoring from the pick-and-roll seems significantly deteriorated now. I know from a recent post that his shot selection has further shifted away from the basket, but even then his floaters and mid-range jumpers have been a staple of his game for as long as I can remember so surely that would only result in a slight decrease in efficiency right?

Now, I noticed he drives and kicks A LOT more, and his attempts at floaters/jumpers/layups often miss. The attempts that he does make seem to largely be from screen assists (like gortat screens), outlet passes, or from difficult foul-drawing shots (which he seems to take a lot more now to compensate).

# What do you all think?

Is this a matter of simply having missed a lot of time, or does team construction play a role? Is his current play style viable in the playoffs, or is can this be easily exposed? And most importantly, is this something to be concerned about long term?

I got a little rambly towards the end, but like I said, I'm not too knowledgeable about basketball nor its more specific statistcs to get a better idea of what's going on, and I really like Luka because of how unique and fun to watch he is so it sucks seeing the struggle he's having as well as that it seems like there isn't much discussion about it!

\excluding his first four games and last game in Dallas and excluding his first three games in LA*

It doesn't seem to change the numbers much, but why exclude some specific games? Was something happening then? He started every game, didn't he? || He still doesn't look 100%. When he's tired and/or injured his shot gets flat due to less lift. Many of his shots are short/front of the rim. || He's still not at 100%. This was his first big injury. He was never out for more than 2-3 weeks before that. He still hasn't found his rhythm completely. He also got traded, so that was another blow. He's also still adapting to his new team. He just doesn't look as confident as he did in Dallas.

I wouldn't really look at his numbers at Lakers this season. They're still trying things out and finding the right chemistry. || He hasn’t been right all year. I remember his first games in Dallas and distinctly remember him and Kyrie missing easy paint shots that they were hitting all playoffs long.

He is starting to look better, the last game was definitely fatigue though. The crazy amount of games they had due to the LA fires probably hasn’t helped || Here was the great analytical post you mentioned which I’ll link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/s/ZNpFWi6N9D) that described how much his shot distribution has changed over time. As you said, he no longer attacks the rim like he used to. 

The interesting part is why has his 2pt% decreased in spite of attacking the rim less.

I think one possible reason, outside of his health and conditioning, is that he doesn’t have an offensive lob threat the way he did in Dallas. Those lobs go under the radar as they wouldn’t count as 2pt attempts but assists, however they  help immensely as they ensure that he doesn’t have to take a contested floater which will or won’t go in. || 20 games is an incredibly small sample size, no conclusions can be made from it. || He is not able to get by guys as easily and stay there. As a result he is not as confident when going to the basket. It is all to do with his physical limitations currently. As good as he is, he is one guy who is clearly not training hard enough to maximise his talent || I’d call this year a complete wash between the injuries before it started, the injuries he picked up in December, and then the trade. We will see what he looks and plays like in October, time to see if he gets serious. I’m a Mavs fan and I fully believe in him still, but it can’t be ignored he doesn’t move like he did in years 1-3. Still generally though is incredible, and he has actually gotten better overall. || With his 30 game calf injury he was not supposed to be healthy this season. The Lakers have no chance of winning so this season is all about chemistry. Give him a regular (long) offseason and another season with his teammates and his efficiency should return. || It’s genuinely a concern and I say this as a lakers fan. Those ignoring it are dumb . If he doesn’t come into next season in great shape I think we will see the lakers not be as good as expected because Lebron is getting older . It’s clear from Lebron injury n return to me that this team most important player is still Lebron because he does so much for the team nobody else can do . Which shouldn’t be the case. Luka sciring right now is entirely reliant on jumpers n thst just isn’t winning basketball unless you shoot like Steph , kd, or Shai , Kawhi and he isn’t that lvl of shooter . His EFG - scoring from the floor - is actually below league average this year. Recent games teams aren’t doubling him and as a result his impact is way lower because less fear about his scoring .

He also passed up many layups in the Indy game for threes . It was annoying too wasn’t like a Rui three either .  As much as people want to hate on Nico watching Luka I understand why he was traded even if people would expect to go younger . What concerns me is these last two games our defence n overall plsy looks better when he sits . We won the non Luka minutes it feels. He has to be better . || Down year. Happens all the time in basketball. Time will tell if it's an anomaly or the norm. I betting it being a weird year.

Anyways his inside the arc game and percentage was is tied to his floater game. He's not taking those enough. If anything he's passing up too many open floaters imo. || This is totally just conjecture but I feel Luka could almost score a 2 or go to the foul line every possession. I low key feel Luka sees a 2 pointer as boring and waste of time. He rather him make a three or set someone up for an open three. || One explanation. He’s over 55% 2pt for last 2 seasons.  This season in 20 games with Mavs, he started off terribly, but ended around 55%.  Only thing changed is the team.  His pick and roll situation is clearly not what he had at Dallas.  And the rest is just getting comfortable with the personnel and plays, not to mention coming off the longest medical absence of his career.  I would add also, his FT attempts and efficiency are up nicely with lakers.  This is a huge counter in terms of offensive efficiency. || He's been out of shape and injured all season. Looks like he's getting back to his slightly overweight build that's much more effective going to the rim. I still think Dallas made the right call. He got close to winning it all, failed due to his own lack of conditioning in the PLAYOFFS (who does that?), and then came back this year in worse shape, after playing world-competitive basketball in the summer. Going backwards right near the finish line, expecting $60m a year for it. Lakers just want to keep the team exciting as they rebuild post-LeBron, but Luka's going to spend his prime putting up huge numbers for teams that fall short because ot him. || Sample size is too small , will almost certainly progress to the mean.  
Eye test suggests his physical condition is similar to last year. || He hasn't looked the same since sustaining that calf injury late in the regular season last year. I believe that's pretty much the entirety of this story. He needs to take this off season seriously or this just might be him forever || [removed] || It's time to face reality. His poor eating and conditioning habits are finally catching up to him. Notice how he looks quite winded after the 2nd half. I remember seeing another comment or post somewhere that Luka's shot distribution is dependent on how fit he is. It looks like grueling effort anytime he tries to drive to the basket and he it looks like he has to exert a lot of energy just to get to that point. I've noticed that he tends to take the easy way out by relying on his step back three when he has a good mid-range and post up game that he doesn't abuse like he did in his younger years because the rapid recovery of youth allowed him to get away with it but now he's 26. There could be a slim chance that he doesn't want to put too much mileage on his body for the regular season and is saving the strategy of attacking the rim once the postseason starts but we'll have to wait and see. 

I know people keep chalking it up saying he's still injured but at the end of the day Luka took his longest break ever to recover for an injury this regular season so it's not an excuse anymore.

Luka Doncic,"""Luka Doncic"" OR ""Luka"" OR ""Doncic"" OR ""The Don""",2025-04-11,nbadiscussion,1jx81kb,The most efficient 30 PPG seasons in NBA history,"Inspired by [Hardwood Paroxysm's tweet](https://x.com/HPbasketball/status/1910709892169818573), I decided to do a slightly more in-depth analysis on the most efficient 30 PPG seasons in NBA history.

# Methodology

I decided to calculate all of the efficiency myself based off of raw total stats, as basketball-reference rounds all of their per-game statistics to 1 decimal place, affecting precision. So the process was: fetch the total stats for the season in question -> calculate each player's averages by stat/GP -> filter out non-qualified players -> calculate shooting efficiency.

To qualify, a player must:

1. Play in at least 58 games for the season.
2. Have an average of at least 20 MPG for the season.
3. Have an average of at least 29.5 PPG (rounded to one decimal place) for the season.

To calculate eFG% the formula is `((PTS - FT) / 2) / FGA`

To calculate TS% the formula is `(PTS) / (2 * (FGA + (0.44 * FTA)))`

To calculate their relative versions (reFG, rTS), it is the player's stat itself minus the league's average of the same stat. Meaning a rTS% of 5 is 5 percentual points above league average TS% for the season.

To calculate their adjusted versions (eFG+, TS+), it is the player's stat itself divided by the league's average of the same stat. Meaning a TS+% of 110 is 110% of the league average TS% for the season.

I expected a bunch of Jokic rows, was surprised to see more Giannis than Jokic. Haven't been appreciating him enough. Also Steph in 2016 was truly a supernova, wow || What I learned from this is that Kareem deserves to get his flowers a lot more than he’s given. What a monster of a guy. 

Giannis too, underrated. I’ve liked his finals performance as one of the best I’ve ever seen, but I didn’t know he was this great || I will forever maintain Steph's 2015-16 season is the single best offensive season in the history of the NBA, otherworldly performance || You did a great job with this, super interesting read. Two observations:

* 2015-16 Steph might very well be the best season of all time.

* 2022-23 Embiid truly was a monstrous offensive season. || My takeaway from this thread is everyone criminally underrates Giannis because he doesn’t shoot triples || I love how you can see the free throw effect when comparing efg and ts lists. Shaq is on one side, Embiid and Shai on the other lol || that Curry season is such a cheat code, 50/45/90 with 30ppg will be veryyyyyy difficult to repeat by anyone else. || Embiid’s MVP was NOT a robbery, and there’s a case to be made for him winning it the year before even if you disagree. All said and done, he deserves 1 and Jokic deserves 3 (possibly 1 more this year) but y’all casuals love to hate on Embiid coz it’s cool and everyone does it || It’s a shame Embiid got hurt last season. Heading into his knee injury, I would argue he was having the best regular season in the modern era. 

36/12/6 in 34mpg on 65%TS, and that’s not even considering the defense

Watching that season, it’s crazy to not see it on here due to games played. What a shame || Why is Dames 2022 season not on this list? Meets all of your criteria and certainly should be

32.2 points per game, 64.5% TS% || Expected Curry at the top, was not suprised.

I'd argue that Steph's game is ALL about efficiency. He is the greatest shooter of all time. The value of the 3pt shot as well as free throws in terms of efficiency is just so much higher than almost anything else (except a dunk probably).

I'd argue that Harden was probably the first player to really focus on those 3 things - 3pt shot, attacking the rim and either get fouled for FTs or make an easy bucket. The issue was that he is a good shooter, not an all-time great one like Steph.

And Steph does all of those things just better and with offball movement.

I am actually surprised that Giannis is on here as often. Yes, most of his game over his career has basically been dunks or layups, but I actually expected his bad FT% + the amount of FT he takes on average to really lower his overall efficiency. His 3pt shooting volume is so low that it wouldn't impact his efficiency too much. || Where does Kobe rank? just curious. I’m assuming he barely missed the top 10. Especially during some of his high scoring years. 

I would guess seasons like 2002-03, 2006-07 and 2008-09 must all be pretty close in the rankings. || My only knock would be using points rather than usage%.  Slower eras won’t be represented as much.  Or is that taken into account somehow?

Thank you the great post! || Now take into account 3 pointers taken, FTs taken, 2s taken, era (defensive rules and spacing make it more difficult for certain guys, like Kobe and AI), and make sure you to stick per 75, since that's more fair.


Great job, imma save this post for myself || JorPoker no where near the top but people insist on calling him the greatest scorer ever because of “scoring tittle” when in fact he was nothing more than a chucker. For those who don’t know he took an average of 300 more shots per season that the guy that came #2 in his scoring tittle seasons. Shot chucking at it’s finest. || Genuinely curious, is there a player who satisfied the 1 and 3 requirement (GP and PPG) and not requirement 2 (MPG)? || He might really be in the 🐐 convo with Mike if 2016 Bron didn’t happen… imagine if Steph had that regular season and a finals MVP in the midst of a 4peat? || Why did you filter by minutes. Was there anyone averaging 30 who played fewer than 20 mpg? If so, that'd be an impressive feat of efficiency on its own || Another metric that showcases how historic Jokic' current season is, and how overrated Shai is.

Also very impressive how superb Giannis is... And with ALL NBA defense. How incredibly underrated. A shame he will likely be chained to just one championship. || Wilt doesn't look nearly as impressive as his seasons really are due to your framing. He was setting the all-time FG% marks while simultaneously shattering the all-time scoring records. Only 2-7 players were reaching the 50% mark in a season then and yet he was doing so while also taking 15-20 more shots and breaking records. They are far more impressive than anything else you've shown here. || With one more game to go, is there any way for Jokic to overtake Curry at the number 1 in efg%? || Curry ‘15-‘ 16 
PPG 30.1   Attempts 20.2

Harden ‘17-‘18 
PPG - 30.4   Attempts 20.1 || fun analysis! really enjoyed reading - the piece that this is missing from this story is the system/team these players were on.

Curry is obviously one of the most efficient scorers of all time but the system created for him enabled it. Same way the systems built around Kobe, AI, and Beal causing them to take more difficult shots due to limited options or a bad team where the defense was anchored on them because of the other players being low threats. Why not look at Offensive Ratings/efficiencies relative to their team/league

also for relative FG% - this could be further analyzed by comparing to the average FG% for the players position of players with a minimum number of FGAs per game to control for these players having to take more difficult shots then say a corner 3 guy or a SG compared to a Center's FG.

lastly the 29.5 PPG is a really limiting criteria - this list would look completely different if controlled differently - the 29.5 PPG basically makes your 20 MPG & 58 games played useless. not many players will fit the criteria of 29.5 PPG outside of those other criteria. || The comments saying “best season of all time”, “best offensive season of all time” when literally the only thing this data reflects in efficiency of players who hit 30+ and nothing else is absolutely wild lol. || Steph's 15-16 to me is not just the undisputed greatest offensive regular season of all-time, but just straight up the best regular season of all-time, period. But yeah, Steph having two seasons in this top 10 as a 6'1"" shooting PG is bonkers || Something tells me that he could’ve had multiple seasons like that one, but refuses to because it’s not really meaningful basketball if the team isn’t really getting the most out of it.

For example, he could’ve pushed to break the 3pointer record vs the Grizzlies, but opted not to because opting to do the little things that made the team win held more importance to him || Could make an argument that Curry should have won mvp in 21, especially now that some are coming out of the woodwork to disqualify team wins/seed as a point to elevate Jokic over SGA this season. Exactly the argument used against Curry that season. || Thank you for the engagement and appreciation! :)

Giannis is definitely one of the most underrated players of all-time, specially offensively.

Honestly my biggest surprise is KD showing up the same amount of times as Isaiah Thomas, but he ""only"" has 2 qualifying seasons || I think the number of “3 qtr” games Steph had limited the number of times he’s on the list.  

Same with the limited number of times KD and Jokic have had 29.5ppg seasons.",0.0,0.721,0.279,0.4754,0.0,0.978,0.022,0.9446,0.083,0.704,0.213,0.9997
