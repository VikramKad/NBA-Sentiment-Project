Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-01-01,nbadiscussion,18x25nv,Where would Donovan Mitchell go that's better than Cleveland?,"Real question as a Cavs fan. Going to the Knicks seems futile since it's basically just the Cavs again? Garland is a better playmaker than Brunson, who doesn't seem like a good fit next to Mitchell, and the bigs don't space the floor. 

We're seeing iso scorers get paid big money, but they're really hard to trade away due to how the team around them needs to change to incorporate them. Harden, Beal, KD, and Kyrie all took a while to get traded for this specific reason. 

Here are the teams I could actually see trying to recruit him:

* Brooklyn
   * Pro: similar to the Cavs before Mitchell, in that it's a borderline playoff team that seems like it's got a good core and just needs a star or two to contend.
   * Con: would have to give up Mikal and DFS in the trade, which is most of their spacing and wing defense (Simmons and Claxton can cover D but rip spacing)
* Indiana
   * Pro:  don't have too many players that can create their own shot outside of Hali rn
   * Con: defense, plus don't have many players that would fit on the Cavs (best assets would be Myles Turner, Buddy Hield, and Bruce Brown, but then the Cavs would have to trade Allen as well)
* LAL, GSW, Toronto, and Miami all could use him, but don't have any worthwhile assets imo

Am I missing something? Is he going to stay another year in Cleveland?",108,190,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/18x25nv/where_would_donovan_mitchell_go_thats_better_than/,2024-01-02 17:17:38,"It’s not always about the roster construction, he probably also would prefer to live in New York over Cleveland || I mean, if you’re ignoring the Knicks than Miami is the answer by far.

Philly will have a max slot next summer if they really wanted him. Not sure Mitchell/Maxey would work defensively, but the other top teams in the east (Boston, Milwaukee, eventually indiana and orlando) don’t have enormous ball handling guards like Luka or other guys in the West who would really make you regret it in the playoffs by hunting them on switches every possession. 

Mitchell is probably good enough to be the 2nd best player on a team that really contends. || ORL would be an intriguing choice, Mitchell/Suggs/Franz/Paolo is an outstanding core, dunno what the package would be exactly that does it for ORL

DET and SAS are both obvious needs but once again what’s the package for CLE

NOP has interesting trade pieces but Mitchell/Zion/Ingram doesn’t seem like a core that makes sense || Do you mean: Which team will chase him in free agency? Or, what team would realistically trade for him now?

His market right now is likely pretty small. He is a tough piece to integrate mid-season, as any team acquiring him will have their offence heavily designed around him.

The key time will be this summer. He will be extension eligible. If he makes All-NBA, he will be supermax eligible, and he probably re-signs in Cleveland, if they are willing to pay him that. It's just too much money to turn down.

On the other hand, if he does not make All-NBA, the question will be whether he accepts a 4 year normal max. If he plays next year out, and makes All-NBA, then he will be supermax eligible, and even if he's not, he would be eligible for a 5 year max in free agency, with the ability to potentially pick his destination.

If he doesn't sign an extension this summer, Cleveland has to weigh the potential of losing him for nothing in free agency, or trading him. They won't get back as much as they dealt for him, because now he would only come with one guaranteed year, instead of the three he had when Cleveland acquired him.

In free agency, it's tough to say who would chase him, because we don't know who will have cap space by then. The Nets seem like the most likely team to target him. We'll see what happens this summer, as guys like Claxton, Royce and Dinwiddie are up for new deals. But, right now, only Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges are locked in for 2025 forward (outside of rookie contracts), so they could certainly have cap space that summer (which is also when Ben Simmons' contract expires).

The Nets would absolutely fall over themselves to try to get Mitchell, who, along with Bridges, would give them a legit top 2. If Mitchell wants to play in NY, that's probably the more likely path now that Brunson has established himself with the Knicks.

Other teams with cap space will probably chase him, too, but it's a bit early to tell who else will have the cap space. You mentioned the Lakers and Warriors, but they can only really get Mitchell with a trade. The Lakers only really have Reaves as a major trade chip, while the Warriors still have guys like Kuminga, Pod and Moody.

The Heat are in a similar situation, with no realistic likelihood of having cap space that summer. Their path would likely be with a trade, and while they didn't have the assets for Dame this past summer, Jaquez's emergence could change the calculation there.

For the Raptors, the Siakam decision determines what they might do. If they re-sign him, then they have no path to cap space that summer, but if they deal him for contract that expire, or if he walks, then Scottie Barnes' low cap hold that summer would give them a path to cap space. Alternatively, a Siakam trade might give them the trade assets, although, presumably the Knicks trade gave them a new backcourt of IQ and RJ, so maybe Mitchell isn't a guy they look to target.

You also mentioned Indy, and while they do project to have cap space, they have it this coming summer, not next summer, and their needs are in the frontcourt, not the backcourt, where Haliburton and Mathurin set them up very well for the future.

I'm not sure what other teams could be possibilities, but the team I would watch is the Nets, for the reasons I mention above. Without control of their own draft picks, and being a NY area team, targeting Mitchell seems like a very likely path for them to explore. || Memphis fans will have to chime in on this, but if things don’t work out for Cleveland or Memphis this year I think it could make sense for the 2 to swap Bane and Mitchell as long as Mitchell agrees to a S&T. 

-Spida is happy cuz he gets the super max and the chance to compete with ja and JJJ for the next 6 years.
-Cleveland is happy cuz we get a lights out shooter next to DG, and get to put the ball back in DG’s hands full time. Probably would require an added pick and another player too.
-would memphis be happy with it? It would push their ceiling even higher, but could also be a worse fit than Bane. It’d be a risk || I think the Nets could be realistic and the Nets would not have to give up Bridges.  I also don’t think Mitchell will get moved this season. || If Jalen Green doesn’t show enough this year, I could see the Rockets potentially going for him. He’s young enough to fit with the current core, he’s the exact type of perimeter scorer that you want to pair with Sengun, and the Rockets have the assets the Cavs would want in return (if they want to take a step back and incorporate more youth). Houston is also a large market and I think they could potentially convince Mitchell to re-sign longterm even though it isn’t NY. 

I bet the Rockets most likely stay put though and continue to just develop their other perimeter prospects (Jalen, Amen, Cam) to see if any of them grow into that second star. If they wanted to accelerate things though, Mitchell is a good option. || Brunson/Mitchell is a terrible idea so I agree that the Knicks don't seem like a good fit. I wouldn't want him in Indiana because it would take the ball out of Hali's hands and we already have too many guards.

Just stick him in San Antonio with Wemby. || BK seems to make the most sense. Close to home and Mikal is perfect backcourt mate for him. Lots of big wings to include one in the trade and still have a couple left over. Finney-Smith would be a great fit in Cleveland. Not sure how great their pick situation is but they got a few good ones from Phoenix who could collapse at any point so they may have enough to make the deal.  A starting 5 of Spyda, Mikal, Cam Johnson, Royce O'Niell, and Claxton is pretty damn good. If Whitehead or Clowney develops, they could really have something. || You're possibly missing the point about the Knicks. It's possible you're right that they are not a better roster fit than Cleveland. But they are a much better team than Cleveland.  Brunson is better than Garland. The Knicks have a big who can score. They have a much better bench (although that might not be as true after a Mitchell trade). And if you're trying to compete, the Knicks have a clearly superior (if sometimes frustrating) coach.

I also think the Knicks are a better roster fit. Randle isn't a spot up shooter, but he can play on offense away from the basket. Cleveland, when healthy, regularly plays two bigs who can't do that in a useful way.  Often, their entire offense is just Mitchell and Garland duplicating each other's efforts.  That would not be nearly as true on the Knicks. || If Boston fails to win the title this year, swapping out Brown for Mitchell could be a possibility. || Miami would be a great fit, they need a Herro upgrade, he just doesn’t provide enough creation, they consistently blow 15 point leads because their offense goes to shit. Mitchell would fit perfectly. Plus Cavs would get Herro back. || The more time that passes the less likely teams are to trade for Mitchell. Everyone knows he's going to the Knicks in free agency. He's not gonna sign an extension with anyone else. The Knicks know it too and aren't gonna give up assets in a trade for someone that will come to them willingly in a couple of years. Their only job is to have a legit team in place before he gets there. Someone might offer something for him thinking they have a 1-2 year window but I kinda doubt it. Its not often that a players team preference is *this* much of an open secret but I just don't think anyone, besides Cleveland, likes the idea of paying him mega money the next few years when they have no chance of retaining him. || Brooklyn wouldn’t trade bridges, they need bridges for Mitchell to be successful in Brooklyn. They could trade a package Spencer Dinwiddie, picks and finney smith  but most likely they would get a third team involved. || Knicks are basically the Cavs again? You mean the team that easily beat them in 5 games in the playoffs? Maybe Mitchell just isn't a winning player? Has that possibility ever been considered? || I think Nets make by far the most sense for him. Think they need a go-to scoring option and have the wings to make it work. Not sure they would HAVE to give up Mikal? Don't they have a ton of draft capital?  Does Cam Johnson, Whitehead, Royce, 3 picks get laughed off the phone? || I’ve always felt that he’d be a pretty good fit in Utah. If only Gobert was still there to space the floor, and Mike Conley for playmaking. Then Mitchell could just focus on being a leader and scoring in the clutch.

Seems like he’d be a great fit in the TWolves!

/s, signed a salty Jazz boy || As a fan of neither the Knicks or the Cavs, I can say they’re not the same situation. On court product aside, the Knicks play in the biggest market in the world for professional sports. Theres more marketing / endorsement dollars in NYC than anywhere else. It’s one of the most prominent cities in the world. Then you have Cleveland. || I hate to even suggest this because I don’t want to give them this idea, but Miami Donovan, Mitchell equals championship. Miami sends out Herro, Jaquez and Martin and whatever else and then it’s a Donovan Mitchell Duncan Jimmy Bam and Love. Witt Lowry on the bench. And I want to take this time to say you’ll be an idiot to make this deal Pat Riley, I dare you. And don’t forget my fee 2% fee || [deleted] || The Knicks are the Cavs? Lmao!! the Cavs sot themselves in the foot the second they put thier nose in big market business. No super star player outside of lebron with ever CHOOSE (sign a deal in free agency on thier own accord and not traded) to play in Cleveland, the Cavs a cooked and the sad part is the entire nba knows where he’s going to go. The Cavs in the end will send him to the Knicks and hopefully learn a lesson || You’re definitely missing something. Mitchell only has a year left on his deal. No one is giving up real assets for him if he doesn’t agree to an extension. And he definitely isn’t signing an extension with Cleveland. So that leaves Miami, NYK, Brooklyn, LAL & Chicago. He’s made it clear he wants to be in New York. To me that leaves two New York teams and a few big markets that might be able to tempt him.  || Come next off season Lakers will have three first round picks to trade. 

Rui, Vincent, Vanderbilt and three first round picks. || Probably Miami’s or Philly. Maybe Memphis? Don’t think he’d fit with OKC. Wild card I could see him going to rockets randomly. || Garland is not a better playmaker than Brunson wtf. Brunson is an all star this year, Garland gets lost creating offense once in a while

Mitchell needs to go where he is the second option to a super star, IF he wants to win. There's a chance he is perfectly content with being a #1 on a team that can't get over the hump. Problem is, all the super stars that he could pair up with (Jokic, Embiid) already have their ideal partner. He'd probably be a good upgrade to Maxxey though || I dunno man, the small small backcourt does not work for long stretches, he is an SG so he has to be next to an all-defense PG for that backcourt to be competent on D. I say OKC with Shai but that's a pipe dream. || You’re overvaluing what Cleveland would get in return. They wouldn’t get Mikal Bridges. In the summer Mitchell can tell them he won’t pick up his option for the 2025-26 season and they would have to play next season and either lose him for nothing just to compete for a 4th or 5th seed at best or trade him for whatever future picks and swaps they can get. || Brooklyn would def give up Ben Simmons and a pick in a S&T. Cleveland gets back a large expiring contract rather than nothing and picks up a first. Then ideally Cleveland could move Simmons to a 3rd team or potentially move a mixture of him and Jared Allen in a larger deal || What team could you add him too without destroying their roster and he would make them a tittle contender?  

In the East, if you add him to the Knicks, Heat or Nets they still are behind the Celtics and Bucks.  I don't think he pushes the Sixers  to title contention because of his overlap with Maxey. 

In the West the Warriors if they swap him for Klay but that seems unlikely.  The Lakers are probably his best trade destination as they have assets, Reaves, Rui, and Russel who have value. || I’d be very surprised if the Pacers had even remotely interest. Our biggest area of need is at the 4 and perhaps the 3 although Nesmith has been balling. 

Maybe if Mathurin’s development begins to stutter we might want to add a guard, but it would have to be a more defensive minded one because I think everyone in Indiana expects that offensively Mathurin can run with most by year 4."
Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-01-01,nbadiscussion,18wxcy8,5 NBA Final Sleeper Picks,"Alright, let's dive into the top 5 NBA Finals sleeper teams this season.

Please let me know your sleeper picks and why in the comments.

**1. OKC Thunder**
So, the OKC Thunder are kinda like the new kids on the block who are suddenly cool. They're the second youngest team and sitting pretty at 2nd in the West. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is basically turning into a superstar right before our eyes. And with Chet Holmgren back, things are looking up. They've got Lu Dort, Josh Giddey, and others who are stepping up big time. But, to really be in the contender conversation, they might need just one more piece, maybe a seasoned vet or another star to help Shai out. They're close, but not quite there yet.

**2. Cleveland Cavaliers**
Now, the Cavs are interesting. They won 51 games last season, which is no joke, but they kind of fizzled out in the playoffs. They've got Donovan Mitchell, who's a total game-changer, and their defense is top-notch. I mean, they were the best in defensive efficiency last season! They've added some firepower too with Max Strus and Georges Niang. If their offense can match their defense, they could really surprise everyone.

**3. Minnesota Timberwolves**
The Timberwolves are at a crossroads. Last year wasn’t super impressive with just 42 wins, but there's potential. Anthony Edwards is shaping up to be a star, and the team's big bet on Rudy Gobert needs to pay off. Karl-Anthony Towns is still a force, but the clock's ticking. This season could be a make-or-break for them. If they figure out how to make Gobert and Towns work together with Edwards leading the charge, they could shake up the West.

**4. Miami Heat**
The Heat, man, they're like that underrated band that always puts on a great show but doesn’t get enough love. They were the Eastern Conference champs, and still, people are sleeping on them. Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo are elite, and Coach Spoelstra is a wizard. Miami is also a magnet for big-name free agents, so don’t be surprised if they snag someone huge and suddenly look like title contenders.

**5. Los Angeles Lakers**
Last, we've got the Lakers. They were a hot mess early last season but turned things around big time after reshuffling the deck at the trade deadline. Rui Hachimura and D'Angelo Russell were great pickups, and LeBron and AD are still LeBron and AD. They made it to the Western Conference Finals, which was a surprise, and now they're looking to build on that. If they can keep up that late-season energy, they could go even further this time around.

---

So, there you have it. They might not be the favorites right now, but they've got the talent and potential to shake things up. Keep an eye on them, and don't be shocked if one of them goes all the way!",0,25,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/18wxcy8/5_nba_final_sleeper_picks/,2024-01-02 14:07:28,"The wolves have been the 1 seed for like three months, how are they a sleeper? || None of these are sleepers besides maybe the Cavs.

Like have you not been engaging woth the community since the start of the season or what.

The Timbwrwplves are the 1st seed in the west, the Thunder the 2nd seed, the Lakers won the IST, the Heat  have a more solid record than last year and nobody doubts their ability to perform surprise wins.

The Cavs are just sort of mid at the moment and havent been doing anything special and there is no reason to really think they are gonna be special this season. || It’s like this was written pre season. Almost no analysis of what they are doing this season. || NGL, I've been at a loss since the offseason as to why people think the cavs gained firepower with Niang and strus, and have only gotten more confused as the season goes on. Niang at .515 ts%, .329 from 3 taking 7.6 shots per game and 4.6 3s for 8.1 ppg, and strus at .527 ts, .339 from 3 taking 12.4 shots per game and 8.3 3s for 13.8 ppg is absolutely abysmal offense. 20 shots between them to put up 22 points is not ideal, and not even hitting 35% from 3 for guys hailed as 3 point specialists is downright ugly. They're the only ones of those 5 I'd call a sleeper, cause they're the only ones of be surprised to see in the finals || Pacers. If they make a move at the deadline and Carlisle gets them to play defense, then there is no reason they can't contend. They have the #1 offense, if they can maintain that and get to top 15 defense they become scary. They'll definitely need to make a trade for this to happen though (Siakam.) || Thunder is looking elite for sure. But they are still very inexperienced. I also wouldn't take too much in their head 2 head matchups with Denver. 

Denver vs thunder game 1 - blowout by Denver 

Denver vs thunder game 2 - horrible foul call for SGA in closing seconds or else Denver wins. 

Denver vs thunder game 3 - back 2 back for Denver and Murray has been terrible on back 2 backs pretty much all year. 

Denver at their best is still much better I think. || Never proved themselves in the playoffs. First time in a very long time where they are even top three seed. Think of it like the 2014-15 Atlanta Hawks, they were the #1 seed in the East and had the best record in the league in the regular season yet most fans knew the lack of experience and going against more experienced opponents (Lebron and Cavs) would hurt the Hawks. Hawks ended up getting swept in the playoffs that year regardless if they were the first seed. || Yeah I don't think the Cavs are anybody's sleeper pick to make the Finals this year, and I say this as a die-hard Cavs fan. The injuries have been absolutely crippling, and even when they were relatively healthy, the offense was run very poorly. It's a situation in which the coach overperforms with little talent but underperforms with a lot of talent. 

Even when everybody comes back healthy I'm still skeptical that the Cavs will finish in the top 6. This looks like a prediction from before the season, not 40% into the season. || It reads sort of like chatgpt honestly || This is the correct answer. Pacers nuggets final would be amazing. || Good take. I think this is probably the best choice for sleeper if they make a move || Sure, but this year people are genuenly thinking of the Timberwolves as a threat. And a ton of people think the Thunder can make noice this year too.

The Lakers are always a threat and nobody doubts that even now.

And same to the Heat, who are being hyped up for finding diamonds out of nowhere.

None are really sleeper picks, just not the favorites. || Yeah if its a before the seasons start then it makes sense for the Thunder, Cavs and Timberwolves...but not for the Lakers and Heat. Would also be weird for it to be posted now. || I doubt the lakers. Play in team for sure. || I think the Celtics and Nuggets are clear favorites and that’s about it. Every other team has real question marks. Contenders include Bucks, 76ers, Clippers, Lakers/Suns. I don’t think a team that has never been a threat in the playoffs can be considered a contender. I would say the Miami Heat are contenders before the Thunder and Timberwolves. Simply cause regular season vs playoffs are two complete different beast. Experience and chemistry will beat talent in the playoffs. || Well they sucked last year untill they didnt and then got to the wcf so you never know. || I do agree with you on that, but not everyone does and some do have them among their favorites.

That said it isnr really far to the Timberwolves since last yeah they were beaten in the 1st round by the Nuggets, who ended up winning it all. And they still did give us a challenge. || The Wolves beat the Celtics and the Nuggets already this year 🤷‍♂️ || The moral victories and absolute hopium surrounding the lakers are something I’ll never understand.

They’re not contenders. || Very fair points! Respectable point of view. || Look with that logic the only true contenders are the Bucks, Celtics and Nuggets.

The rest either dont have the past playoff success to do it or are lacking in this years regular season. || OKC and MIN also look good, I’m biased though and think the nuggets will win again. Likely nuggets vs Celtics finals. || Hmmm same, though im biased too.

Like the sixers have also looked great and the Heat are looking dam solid for what we know that Jimmy is gonna do in the playofs.

But i dont wanna discount the Suns or Lakers or any of those teams jsut yet. Not saying they are gonna get to the finals, but they are gonna be annoying to deal with."

**_Overview of Financial Assessment_**

The financial assessment of NBA players involves analyzing their performance metrics relative to their salaries. Key performance indicators like Win Shares (WS), Box Plus/Minus (BPM), and Value Over Replacement Player (VORP) offer insights into a player's contribution to their team. By juxtaposing these metrics against their respective salaries, we can gauge which players are providing value commensurate with their compensation and which may be considered overvalued or undervalued assets.

**_High-Value Assets_**

Players like Nikola Jokić, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and LeBron James demonstrate a strong correlation between high salaries and high performance metrics. Jokić, for instance, stands out with exceptional WS (6.5), BPM (13.7), and VORP (4.2), justifying his substantial salary of approximately $47.6 million. Similarly, Curry, Durant, and James, with their significant contributions in all three metrics, prove to be valuable assets to their teams. These players' performance not only justifies their high salaries but also underscores their critical roles in their teams' successes.

**_Underperforming High-Earners_**

Conversely, Gordon Hayward of the Charlotte Hornets can be seen as an overvalued asset when we look at his performance metrics in relation to his salary. With a WS of 0.6, a negative BPM of -2, and zero VORP, Hayward's performance metrics are not reflective of a player with a high salary, which stands at around $31.5 million. These figures suggest that Hayward may not be contributing to his team's success as much as his salary would warrant. His lower output in key statistical areas, particularly his negative BPM, indicates that he is underperforming compared to the average player in the league, a concerning sign for a player commanding such a significant portion of the team's payroll. Similarly, Simmons, with a WS of 0.3 and negligible contributions in BPM and VORP, may not be justifying his salary of approximately $37.9 million. These players, despite their high earning, are not providing the expected level of contribution to their teams.

**_Overlooked and Efficient Performers_**

In contrast, some players are delivering exceptional value relative to their salaries. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is a prime example, boasting impressive metrics (WS: 6.1, BPM: 10.8, VORP: 3.1) while earning roughly $33.4 million. His performance relative to his salary makes him an extremely efficient investment for his team. Similarly, players like Jayson Tatum and Domantas Sabonis, with strong performance metrics and salaries under $33 million, are providing excellent value. These players exemplify how effective talent evaluation can yield high-impact players at comparatively moderate salary levels.

**_Financial Implications for Teams_**

From a financial standpoint, teams investing in players like Jokić, Curry, and Durant are seeing a substantial return on their investment in terms of on-court performance. However, the cases of Beal and Simmons highlight the risks associated with high salaries not aligning with player performance, potentially limiting a team's financial flexibility and hindering its ability to build a well-rounded roster. Efficient investments in players like Gilgeous-Alexander, Tatum, and Sabonis demonstrate a more balanced approach, allowing teams to allocate resources effectively across their rosters.

I'm just starting with data analysis; I'm currently an undergrad Economics student and I'm trying to incorporate Economics concepts to basketball. If anyone has any ideas or feedback let me know! (data used is from basketball-reference.com)",75,16,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/18vq7o6/an_analysis_of_the_highest_earners_in_the_league/,2024-01-01 00:51:34,"A lot of the guys on the high-earning poor performers list (Klay, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, and Gordon Hayward, which you mentioned) will see huge drop offs in their next contract, which will be coming up soon. This is despite a general increase in salaries for average salaries. || Great read. I personally would add some “harder” counting stats like ppg, apg, and rpg relative to their team’s total and where their team is relative to the rest of the league. I’m a big advanced stats lover, but they need a lot of work before they’re able to fully capture a player’s impact, and many fans discredit them entirely. True shooting is also good to throw in. In terms of advanced stats, LEBRON (luck-adjusted player estimate using a box prior regularized on-off), RPM (real plus minus), and WARP (wins above replacement player) are the other 3 I generally use in my statistical analysis. WS per 48 will just add another layer of depth

I would also ditch BPM for OBPM or RPM. There is still not a single advanced defensive metric (that I’ve seen) that can actually capture a player’s defensive impact, BPM’s creator cautions it shouldn’t be used defensively without context. All it does on the defensive end is count box score stats (blocks and steals), the leaderboards of which do not usually mirror the best defensive players in the league 

If the player changed teams, measuring their impact on their new team is often much easier to do / quantify, and will be more compelling than advanced stats alone || You do a good job with objective commentary,  meaning the distillation of stats into objective language without bias or conjecture. 

I just wanted to say it's really good to have this foundation because at every step of the analytical way there's a temptation to affirm/deny personal or specific narratives. || [removed] || Shouldn't games played matter?  Like for years kawhi super efficient but hasn't played 60 games a year since 2018!  That makes his contract an albatross. || No stat can holistically capture anything. But the fact that on court skill isn't all that affects defence means that a stat that can accurately capture a players defensive skill might be less useful than dbpm at measuring defensive impact because of how offense and defence bleed into each other.

Ofc, assuming we are using these as impact metrics rather than a top 10 list. || I appreciate it, and thank you for the feedback. I think my overall aim with this was to put players we’re all already familiar with and try to add additional perspective of their performance relative to salary. If you wanted to analyze truly undervalued players you’d need much more in-depth analysis of players. 

I agree with the advanced stats needing a lot of work though. Especially in the case of Win Shares to where it over-inflates the value of a player on a winning team. Going forward I’ll definitely add more traditional counting stats relative to their team totals, probably through a percentile ranking. || People think dbpm is broken because jokic in particular continues to top that list despite being pretty mid on defence.

I wonder if opponents run more size and less shooting against jokic which stops jokic from dominating the paint at the cost of lower offensive output leading to seemingly inflated defensive numbers for jokic.

These effects also seem to hold for players that get to the rim at will. || Sorry for responding late currently dealing with the ‘vid, but I appreciate it man. It’s hard sometimes to look at things objectively, especially for me because I’m a huge Mikal and Cam Johnson fan. || We removed your comment for being low-effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || Win shares and Vorp are both cummulative stats affected by play time. BPM is the only stat here that doesn't account for that and is only about rating their impact when they play. VORP is basically the cummulative version of BPM. || You’re welcome, always love to see detailed statistical analysis on here. That’s a great point about familiarity, to be done right most advanced stat-cases sadly take too much time to be realistic 

And yea that’s my biggest issue with most advanced stats, they always benefit 2 types of players the most: those on great teams, and those putting up great stats on terrible teams. Both types get overrated while any kind of real defensive impact goes mostly unnoticed, because it’s too hard to quantify. Things like a slight step over to close a passing lane, when to go over / under a screen, and when to switch are cartoonishly hard to calculate || It’s not just who leads / makes the top of the list and is obviously not that caliber of a defender, the stat literally does nothing but count blocks and steals. Any amount of watching games will tell u those are far from all that measure a player’s defensive impact, and the creator of the stat says it plainly in his introduction

I wrote out a bit my other comment but too much of defense is currently impossible to calculate: when to switch or help, when to let someone shoot vs close out, good vs bad post-footwork, effectively closing a passing lane, properly working in a zone, etc. Things like what % of opponent’s shots are in the paint are usually much more accurate for measuring rim protection than blocks or even fg % in the paint, but doesn’t mean much if u don’t know the other team’s roster and strengths

Interesting point about rosters vs Jokic, at least from what I’ve seen that looks to be true, he definitely gets bigger second units but I’d love to look into it over the past couple seasons. His defensive stats also get a bit inflated because he has such good defenders around him it often creates easy blocks in the paint or deflections because there’s nowhere else for the ball handler to go || No it’s cos it over values steals from a cebtre || Ah ok. Thanks!  I'm not a stat buff so I'm not 100 site what all of those entailed || That's not how dbpm works"
Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-01-03,nbadiscussion,18xp383,Knicks/Raptors Trade TPEs,"**EDIT: SOLVED**

Per Woj, the Knicks generated a $5.2m TPE and the Raptors generated a $4.3m TPE in the deal. I imagine this means that RJ was traded straight up for OG and, on the flip side, Achiuwa and Flynn were traded for 10 - thus both teams end up with a TPE.

My question is: Wouldn't the Raptors' TPE be only $4.08m? Achiuwa - $4,379,527, Flynn - $3,873,025 = $8,252,552; Subtract IQ - $4,171,548 = $4,081,004.

Where does the $4.3m number come from? The only thing I can think of is that somehow, the Knicks traded 1Q for Flynn and Achiuwa's salary is the TPE. This was further proven by Spotrac: Spotrac-TOR > Exceptions > ""Precious Achiuwa trade with NYK""

Can the Knicks have done 2 separate 1:1 deals and then absorbed Achiuwa without any outgoing salary? The Knicks and Raptors are both operating above the soft cap so I don't see how this would be possible. Were the Knicks granted their DPE for Mitchell Robinson, thus allowing them to absorb Achiuwa with nothing outgoing? Not sure...  


**SOLVED**  
  
NYK broke it down as so:  
  
(-) RJ Barrett - $23,883,929  
  
(+) OG Anunoby - $18,642,857  
  
= A difference of $5,241,072;  
  
NYK sends out more than TOR. TPE created for NYK in the amount of the difference (\~$5.24m)  
  
(-) Immanuel Quickley - $4,171,548  
  
(+) Malachi Flynn - $3,873,025  
  
No TPE created.  
  
(+) Precious Achiuwa - $4,379,527 into Mitchell Robinson's DPE.  
  
Reason the Knicks do this (to the best of my knowledge): DPE expires in 3 months, TPE in 12. DPE must be used on an expiring contract, TPE does not.  
  
  
  
TOR broke it down as so:  
  
(-) OG Anunoby - $18,642,857  
  
(-) Malachi Flynn - $3,873,025  
  
Subtotal: (-) $22,515,882  
  
(+) RJ Barrett - $23,883,929  
  
(+) Immanuel Quickley - $4,171,548  
  
Subtotal: (-) $28,055,477  
  
Toronto takes in more than they send out so they don't generate a TPE. Instead:  
  
(-) Precious Achiuwa - $4,379,527  
  
Toronto sends out Achiuwa for nothing, thus generating a TPE worth \~$4.4m for themselves",17,16,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/18xp383/knicksraptors_trade_tpes/,2024-01-03 12:46:14,"Knicks applied for our DPE for Mitch about two weeks ago, (absolutely hate to see it) I’m honestly not sure how this worked though. I think you’re right, they technically got Achiuwa for nothing “outgoing” because of the DPE, which had to have been approved at some point before the trade went through || Raps have face horrible teams, knicks have beat good teams. Raptors still have to prove if the trade worked for them || [deleted] || Right so then my only questions are:

1. Why blow the DPE on generating a slightly larger TPE? Trading RJ for OG, Flynn and Achiuwa is within the 125% margin and IQ for nothing results in a $4.1m TPE... only slightly lower than the reported $5.3m TPE they got, and this way, they don't need to blow the DPE. My guess is that they did so because the DPE deadline is in March and the TPE will be in December. Either that or because a DPE can only be used on an expiring contract.
2. Why didn't we hear anything about the league approving of the Knicks' DPE request? || Hahaha I was looking for this. Ok so I guess I'm not sure either lol. || TPE likely has a longer shelf life, 1 full year to use I believe, vs a DPE that expires at the end of the season || [deleted] || Yup. DPE has to be used by March actually. || 2nd rounders count as 1.1 million. The value is based on the rookie minimum. || 1. I think the Knicks have a bigger move cooked up. Begley seems pretty sure and it’s the general sentiment among us fans, whether it’s for a superstar or more likely just a better shot creator. They gave themselves time to see how everyone fits before the deadline and still have lots of picks (kept all our firsts) + Fournier’s contract to work with, it’ll probably be the marginal difference that makes a Clarkson or Dejounte trade work. If they don’t, the TPE could be used in a trade before /during year, where the DPE expires in March

2. Totally guessing but there’s likely a few days between when the league doctor examines the player and reports back to the league, and when it gets announced as approved. This kinda confirms it, because the Knicks 100% had to use the DPE with the Woj reported TPE numbers (as long as he’s correct). There was probably some pressure from both teams to approve it quickly so they could get the deal done and both make TPEs, Masai has been infamously slow to use theirs but probably wants one for a possible Siakam trade. || Thanks for the detailed response. Makes sense. In addition to your 2nd point, the Knicks were in a particular hurry to make this deal as if opened a window for them to offer OG a vet extension on June 30 worth 4/116.9m. Maybe they have something verbally worked out where he'd accept that if offered and not test FA where he can technically get a max of 42m+ per year? No idea. || You’re welcome, love talking about weird salary stuff lol. Yup, we’ve been meaning to do 2 things: move our team’s timetable together (Brunson and Randle are on bargain deals for the next 2 years, will both get huge maxes after), and dump RJ’s contract. This deal did both, the sooner they got it done the better for both teams in terms of time to gauge fit

Knicks have been after OG for awhile, offered a couple firsts in 2022 iirc but Raptors said no. Then he left Klutch last summer which was a huge sign that he’d resign for Knicks, he’s also said he’d take a pay cut to be in NYC but I’d be shocked if it was ~120/4, he’ll probably get ~35/year and I’m happy with that considering new CBA. He’s the perfect 3&D guy for a contending or trying-to team, he’d probably get more from Philly or others || Love talking about weird salary stuff too. Big cap nerd. Learning still.

The timeline fit is huge and can not be understated. As much as it pained me to see IQ go, fact are, OG was the better suitor for the timeline and style of play we have. It was malpractice to not at least investigate what we had with him alongside JB and especially when we had Burks and Payton starting, it should have been him. However, IQ will flourish in TOR and we got our man. Now we wait to see who we cash in the chips for. || 100%. I was a huge IQ fan and RJ defender, really really wanted them to be our homegrown duo but this is ultimately better for them and us. IQ can thrive as a starter and now RJ’s playing with house money, at home. The reports that his value relative to contract was essentially net zero league-wide in the last few days confirmed what most of us already feared

This is one of those rare deals where both teams 100% won imo. OG has looked phenomenal so far, and now we’re in a pretty ideal situation to make that last move or two to be in contention. Timeline together but still a young team, tons of assets left, and reputation improving everyday. If Mitch was healthy, we’d be probably be the 2nd best defense in the league. I’m a pretty young Knicks fan but our future has never looked even close to this bright in my lifetime, so excited to see what they can pull off || Was just digging into the defensive numbers from last night. OG defended DeMar for 59.8% that OG was on the court playing defense. 40.9 possessions. In that span? 3 PTS on 33% from the field. Lone made 3.

Hart, Hartenstein, DiVincenzo, McBride and Grimes allowed 27 PTS on 13-for-14 in 23.9 possessions. 

OG is an ALPHA defender.

[Source](https://www.nba.com/game/chi-vs-nyk-0022300468/box-score?dir=D&sort=partialPossessions&type=matchups) || He looks beyond phenomenal. He’s a +52 plus/minus in TWO games, where we held the Wolves and Bulls to 106 and 100. They average 113 and 110 respectively 

It’s not just his individual impact either. Grimes now doesn’t have to guard the other team’s best player every night and Hart doesn’t have to constantly guard much bigger forwards. OG’s one of the best wing defenders in the league, top 3-5 in overall defense and probably the most versatile. Can lock down ANYONE 1-4 and 5 too with some help, been looking at posts from Raps fans over the last couple years about how he was legit their entire defense and one of the most sought-after players in the league. Deal couldn’t have gone better imo || Agreed. One thing that irks me is that Hart's and Grimes' defensive value have dropped tremendously. Getting OG will help no doubt, but if they're playing to 90% of their defensive capabilities, this is THE best defensive unit in the game, bar none. That DRTG will come down."

To be clear, this is not a predictions post, and I'm not considering the latest fan ballots or anything. This is simply who I believe should be the Eastern All-Stars at this point in time after watching hundreds of games and diving into the numbers. While I think the actual pool of Eastern candidates worthy of serious consideration was smaller than in some previous years, making the final selection or two was harder than usual, and the final spot may come down to this next week until the reserves are announced. Let's get into it.

\[As always, I've compiled some video clips for this article. They [can be viewed in-context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-true-and-deserving-2024-eastern).\]  


# Eastern Conference Starters

**G: Tyrese Haliburton, Indiana Pacers**  
  
**G: Jalen Brunson, New York Knicks**  
  
**F: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks**  
  
**F: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers**  
  
**F: Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics**  
  
80% of the Eastern starters are no-brainers. Embiid and Giannis are two of the five likeliest players to win MVP, and they ain’t fifth (although Embiid is already pushing the NBA’s 65-games-played eligibility rule; one more serious injury, and he’ll be disqualified). They are obvious selections and need no more words.  
  
Tatum has been the two-way force pushing the Boston Celtics to the league’s best record. In some small ways, he’s a victim of his team’s stacked roster and expected success. His numbers are down a tiny bit, and nobody talks about his season because it’s the season he’s supposed to be having. But he’s still one of the few ultra-stars in the league and an easy choice here.  
  
Tyrese Haliburton leads the league in assists, almost never turns it over, and is scoring nearly 24 points per game on sparkling 50/40/86 shooting splits.1 His scintillating performance during the In-Season tournament opened the nation’s eyes to the magic happening in Indiana, and the Pacers’ recent trade for Pascal Siakam suggests they think their window of title contention is now. It’s indisputable that Tyrese has been the league’s best pure point guard in the classic sense.  
  
The only difficult choice here was the second guard spot. I ended up selecting Jalen Brunson.  
  
Brunson is a deserving starter. He’s averaging 26.5 points, 6.5 assists, and 3.9 rebounds while setting career-highs in three-point volume (6.5 attempts per game) and accuracy (an astonishing 43%!). While Brunson isn’t a lockdown defender, he’s no worse than his competition on that end, and he has found ways to contribute: he [leads the league in charges drawn](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/hustle-leaders). For perspective, his .56 charges drawn per game are double sixth-place Kyle Lowry’s efforts.  
  
Like James Brown or Stevie Wonder, Brunson makes his living off of funk. His basslines are his probing forays to the hoop (he ranks [fifth in the league in drives per game)](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives?dir=D&sort=DRIVES). Once in the paint, he can unleash his uniquely staccato midrange moves filled with electric footwork and creative shots:  
 \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-true-and-deserving-2024-eastern)\]  
  
Brunson’s bag overfloweth with hesitations, half-spins, weirdly syncopated dribbles, and sudden stops and starts. In some ways, his game reminds me of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, although their methods are far different.  
  
[The Knicks’ offense dies without him](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4466/onoff#tab-team_efficiency), and he proved in last year’s playoffs that he can drive high-level winning despite his diminutive stature. I don’t think Brunson will get this starting spot in real life, but as of right now, he’d be my pick.  


# Reserves

**G: Damian Lillard, Milwaukee Bucks**  
  
**G: Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks**  
  
**F: Bam Adebayo, Miami Heat**  
  
**F: Jaylen Brown, Boston Celtics**  
  
**F: Paolo Banchero, Orlando Magic**  
  
**WC: Donovan Mitchell, Cleveland Cavaliers**  
  
**WC: Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia 76ers**  
  
Let’s keep going with the reserve guards.  
  
By his own absurd standards, Damian Lillard has had an uneven season for the Bucks. But he’s still scoring 25+ points every night, dropping dimes, and firing from wayyyy behind the arc. His eight free throw attempts per game on 92% shooting from the line are buoys the Bucks’ offense clings to when Antetokounmpo is out of the game. He’s [also been a monster in crunch time](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/clutch-traditional?dir=A&sort=PTS), important for a team that’s been squeaking out victories. Milwaukee has had some very, very weird vibes this season, but they are still 29-10 when Lillard plays. Imagine what the Bucks will look like when they figure it out.  
  
Trae Young is playing the best defense of his life (admittedly, that’s a bar an ant wouldn’t have to stretch to cross) while averaging 27 points and 11 assists. He’s either the second- or third-best passer in the league, behind only Jokic and possibly Haliburton. His efficiency numbers aren’t ideal, but he has far less supporting talent around him than his peers here, and like Mitchell, he’s the clear-cut alpha dog on his team. Some may quibble with this pick, but he should be a deadbolt lock.  
  
For big men, it starts with Bam Adebayo. Adebayo is playing his usual brand of DPOY-caliber defense while anchoring the Heat on offense and setting a career-high in rebounds per game (10.5). Every year, he adds something new to his arsenal. This year, it’s free throws (another career-high with 7.2 attempts per game, a hugely important source of offense for a Heat team that often feels stuck in the mud). Bam is Miami’s everything. His passing, screen-setting, and thankless hard rolls to the rim open up the floor for teammates like Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, and Jaime Jaquez, but he still finds time to drop in 22 points each night.  
  
Tatum’s running mate, Jaylen Brown, snags the next spot. The Celtics are the best team in the league by record, and Brown has been their second-best player. Although his raw numbers are down, now that he’s surrounded by talent soaking up usage at every position, Brown seems calmer and more in control than ever before (he has [a career-low turnover rate this season](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/454#tab-offensive_overview)). 23 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 3.6 assists on a team this crowded are still nothing to sneeze at, and 36% from three is a welcome sight for a player whose shot was a bit wonky last season. He’s also still an above-average defender and shockingly mean in-game dunker: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-true-and-deserving-2024-eastern)\]  
  
Paolo Banchero snags my last frontcourt reserve spot. In just his second year, Banchero has averaged 23/7/5 while significantly improving his defense and three-point shot. Advanced numbers favor other players, but Banchero is thriving while playing in arguably the most claustrophobic offense in the league — the Magic shoot the fourth-lowest percentage of shots as threes, and they have the lowest team accuracy in the league. That should make for tough sledding for a 21-year-old like Banchero, yet he’s still bull-rushing his way to the rim and dropping slick dimes. He uses his shoulder as a battering ram, bludgeoning defenders into so much dust and gravel:  
 \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-true-and-deserving-2024-eastern)\]

  
The Magic have surpassed expectations this season, and Banchero’s the reason why.  
  
Meanwhile, the Cavs have probably matched preseason expectations, just not in the expected way. Without Darius Garland or Evan Mobley, Mitchell has been playing like the second-best guard in the East. He’s second in the NBA in steals per game (which overstates his defensive abilities, but still!), and he boasts [one of the league's strongest on/off point differentials](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4362/onoff#tab-team_efficiency). His three-point shot is more prodigious in volume than accuracy, but defenses respect it, and he’s elevated his playmaking to career-best levels. When he’s on, Mitchell is one of the most aesthetically pleasing players to watch.  
  
Maxey has been outrageous this season, picking up almost all of the departed James Harden’s slack. He’s leading the league in minutes per game while averaging career highs in every counting category (even blocks!). Nobody is as fast to the hoop from 35 feet out as Maxey; as I wrote earlier this season, [Maxey is a one-cut running back](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/no-james-harden-no-problem-tyrese). Most NBAers take an exaggerated step as they approach the hoop to slow down and gather control of the ball before laying it up; Maxey speeds up as he nears the rack. He uses human bodies as soft, fleshy brakes, slamming to a screeching halt upon contact with midair defenders and then adjusting with impossible hangtime for pretty finishes:  
\[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-true-and-deserving-2024-eastern)\]  
  
While Maxey’s scoring efficiency has dropped as his volume has increased, that’s made up for by [his literally 100th-percentile turnover rate](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4765#tab-offensive_overview) and increased passing acumen. Perhaps most importantly, [the 76ers have destroyed opponents when Maxey is on the court and Joel Embiid is off](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4765/lineups?off=1049#tab-four_factors); he’s not just riding the big man’s XXXL-sized coattails. His game is all straight lines and toothy grins. Maxey is a deserving and worthy All-Star, and he snags my last wild card spot.  
  
That said, it kills me to leave Raptors forward Scottie Barnes off this list; I flip-flopped like Rainbow Sandals between him and Maxey several times. His 2.9 stocks (steals+blocks) are among the most in the league, and his 37% three-point shooting on a shockingly high 5.5 attempts is a ceiling-changer. I have been overwhelmingly impressed with Barnes’ two-way improvement this season (although it would’ve been nice if the Raptors had won a few games. Now, I expect to see a serious tank this second half of the season to keep their top-six-protected pick).  
  
He’s an offensive fulcrum with a burgeoning three-level scoring ability to pair with his inherent passing vision, and he’s increasingly a defensive monster. As his defense improves, Barnes’ only real holes are turnovers and free throw accumulation, and these are both things young players get better at with time. He’s already good enough to be an All-Star, and he might make the official roster. If you’d rather have Scottie Barnes, the best player on a bad Raptors team, than Maxey, the second-best player on a good 76ers squad, I won’t fault you. I preferred that, too, twenty minutes ago. Maybe it’s time to expand to 15 players per All-Star team.  
  
Julius Randle’s counting stats are iris-popping despite his Arctic-cold start to the season. But if you watch enough Knicks games, [the plays he doesn’t make stand out as much as the ones he does](https://tommybeer.substack.com/p/randle-knicks-disappear-down-the). I picked Randle as an All-Star last season, but I can’t quite do it amidst steeper competition this year. Few players have as big a disconnect night-to-night between the eye test and the box score.  
  
Jimmy Butler has missed too much time, and he's still doing his classic Butler stuff. Nobody in the league is better at letting teammates take the wheel during the regular season to build reps and confidence. Everyone knows who drives the bus in the springtime; Butler will be taking some of the shots and touches from Jaquez and Herro when the lights are brightest. It's to his credit that he doesn't care about that stuff now, but it also means it's harder to justify him earning an All-Star nod given how many games he's missed.  
  
I tried desperately to find a way to put a third Celtic on here, as Kristaps Porzingis, Derrick White, and Jrue Holiday all have compelling cases; I failed. White’s candidacy, in particular, has gained narrative steam thanks to his ability to loudly do the quiet things that impact winning. However, given how many players are having excellent seasons in bigger roles, White misses the cut.",57,18,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/19d3aeb/my_2024_eastern_conference_allstars_who_would_you/,2024-01-22 13:59:36,"Player ranking and comparison is typically not permitted in our sub because the discussions quickly devolve into low-effort bickering.

I'm pumped to see who the final selections are. Coaches always seem to value slightly different things than fans and media, so I'm excited to see how it shakes out. || I know it's more ""fair"" to do this 100% by the #'s then the team rankings, but if you just watch the way Scottie plays I would say it would be very exciting to watch for the casual ASG fans. The only problem is that the title of ""all-star"" that sticks with a player through their career means that people feel ""this player *deserves* the accolade"". 

If we're going entertainment value, I wanna see Barnes throw no-look dimes to top-level scorers or yam it on heads with authority. Also monster blocks. || Who will get in:

Starters (50% fan vote which is mostly known): 4 of 5 starters (Embiid, Giannis, Tatum and Hali) are 100% locks and the 5th starter is very likely to be either Trae or Dame (edit: I guess DM could sneak in). Based on how low Trae was in the Player votes the last couple years, I'd guess this will be Dame (/DM) but .. it will be close.   

The reserves are chosen by the coaches vote. For the fixed positions I believe they will vote:

Guards:  Brunson, Spyda, 

Frontcourt: Brown, Bam, Barnes

The last two, open, positions are hard but I think they will go with two of Trae, Maxey and Randall.  I think we might get 6 guards with Randall out but these players and a few others (Butler, White, Franz, Banchero) still have a week or so to drop some attention getting performances.  


-------


If I was king:

My team would be pretty close to that. I'd swap in Butler for Jalen Brown which I'm sure zero people will agree with. By the standard criteria Brown 100% deserves it and Jimmy doesn't but, as king, I can just flush the standard criteria which I have a couple big issues with. 

First, voting on half a season is dumb when I have a whole season and playoffs since my last vote. I looked for official criteria to see if it explicitly restricts us to voting based on the current season's game's only and didn't find any. So that's why I'm elevating Jimmy who's missed a lot of games in 23-24 but played a ton of games since last year's All Star break.  

Second, I'm not a quota guy who tires to dole out one All-Star to each good team and only gives two to the very best teams. While team record should rightly help, it shouldn't guarantee anything. There are many ways to build teams from one star to many. The teams build around 2 clear stars will get two all stars more than the ones with 4+ stars, that's just how it works.  Brown loses points for being on a super stacked lineup and while his ppg makes him a clear #2, his advanced metrics tend to put him from 4th to 6th. And that's not just this year, it's a pattern with JBrown every year. What other all-star candidates this year have that issue? Banchero?  Yeah he isn't anywhere near my team. || >That said, it kills me to leave Raptors forward Scottie Barnes off this list; I flip-flopped like Rainbow Sandals between him and Maxey several times.

For the East, I think Maxey is an All-Star, and I think the decision is more down to Barnes vs Banchero vs Trae Young.

Putting Trae in that spot is largely for the same logic as Barnes: the Hawks suck. Trae puts up more offensive stats, but also has defensive weaknesses that are a large part of his team's issues with winning. Barnes has lower offensive put than Trae, but much of a well-rounded impact, because of his rebounding, screening and defensive impact.

Both Trae and Scottie are held back as candidates based on their teams' lack of winning, which is where Banchero had the edge. While he clearly has am edge now, too, it wasn't what it was before. A few weeks ago, the Magic were a top 4 seed and it made sense to say, ""as a top 4 seed they deserve a representative"". Now, they are sitting 8th and only 3 games above .500, which is still much better than the Hawks and Raptors, but no longer at the level where you can really say that the Magic deserve to have a representative just by virtue of their team success.

In a conversation a few weeks ago, Banchero vs Scottie had come up and I had said that I thought Scottie had the better individual case, but that Banchero would get the nod because of his team's success.

While I have no doubt that Paolo will make plenty of All Star games, he is in his second season, and doesn't really stand out as a bona fide All-Star yet, on an individual basis. In particular, his 53.6% TS is really low, and while his team has done pretty well, it's largely on the back of an awesome defence. While Paolo isn't a defensive weak spot like Trae, he also isn't the guy driving Orlando's defensive success.

I think that right now, I would give the edge to Scottie and Trae for those last two spots, based on the individual production or Trae and the all-around impact of Scottie, but I think it really comes down to how you rank individual success vs team success. || I'm pretty much on the same line as you, but instead of Brunson I'm thinking Jaylen Brown as the second starting guard. Mostly because he is contributing to an incredibly high level to what is by far the best team in the East. I'm normally not a fan of multiple starters for the same team, but this year it feels right. 

That isn't to say that Brunson is not deserving, he has been superb as well and I don't have any qualms with that selection. || [removed] || [removed] || I think the strongest argument against Paolo being an all star is that the Magic have a lackluster offense. What separates the Magic from a team like the Raptors (note - even the Raptors have a better offensive rating than the Magic) is that they have one of the best defenses in the league. They are 4th best in points allowed per 100. And that seems to indicate that much of the value in the team comes from defensive specialists (e.g. Suggs, Isaac, Goga) and defensive scheming (e.g. they are 3rd best in FT% allowed while leading the league in fouls, suggesting that they foul strategically). || Reasonable argument. The advanced stats are not kind to Paolo, but this is the rare case where I have to disagree with them. Maybe I'm jumping the gun.

I mentioned this to someone else, but I have such a tough time with valuing sub-superstar number-one guys. I think of it like, does Paolo deserve more or less credit for not fulfilling his more important role to the degree that, like, Porzingis does as a third- or fourth-best option in Boston? || I toyed with the idea of making this entire article about the All-Star game we'd actually WANT to watch ha. Maybe I still will in the future. Barnes would be a starter, no question. || I ran through many of the same arguments in my own head for this, and it's possible I'm anchored too tightly to my conviction from a few weeks ago that Banchero was a no-brainer All-Star. 

Whereas Trae and Barnes are both on bad teams, though, I think I might be subconsciously penalizing Barnes more because I liked the talent in Toronto much more than in Atlanta, even if it was too often redundant. It's weird to me the Raptors weren't at least an average team, and I thought from watching the games that some it was just on Barnes still growing into his role as the primary offensive guy (and despite his outrageous block and steal rates, I think his defense is still improving, too). 

The advanced numbers are not kind to Paolo, but it felt to me like he was succeeding despite his surrounding cast, whereas Barnes wasn't able to bring the Raptors up a level. 

I don't like cases built off things that can't be proven via numbers, but that's my story and I'm sticking with it! 

I think there are plenty of good reasons to pick Barnes over Banchero, though, so no issues here with that thought process || I think the Raptors are going to suck more because losing Siakam is huge. Plus we won't have Poeltl for a bit. And Scottie is playing the OG role more which is gassing him on the offensive end. A big surprise for Scottie this season was the huge 3pt% increase, but for the last couple of games he's not hitting at the same clip because his legs are dead.

So while he may be deserving in my books, I think Banchero has an easier case. || I'm petty sure Brown is listed as a forward in the front court, though I do agree with your line of thinking. I don't like the idea the guard spots look like they are all going to be point guard on both east and west side from Anthony Edwards.... truly shows how the shooting guard position had devolved and the NBA has become 1 pg, 3 wings (or 4) and 1 center(or none) || We removed your comment for being low effort.

Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-01-22,nbadiscussion,19d12fq,New Advanced stats development !?!,"Im working on creating a new NBA stat that takes the PPP Difference above/below league avg multiplied by the number possessions for a specific playtype. Then I do the same for types of contested shots (Ex. defender within 0-2, 2-4, 4-6 ft). After that I combine all the data from different play types to get what I call ""Relative Possession success rate above/below League avg"". 

Here are the players that lead this stat on the offensive end for the 22-23 season

5.882745872	Luka Doncic  
5.722843612	Damian Lillard  
5.337645188	Giannis Antetokounmpo

5.09563403	Stephen Curry  
4.995423949	Kevin Durant  
4.96126501	Kyrie Irving

Obviously im in the first steps of making this but the idea behind the stat is to show how successful a player is at their  play style compared to league avg. The reason I then multiply by the number of possession for the play style is because it then show how consistent they are with adding in volume. For example a player scoring 1.2 PPP on 2 possession is not as impressive as a player scoring 1.2 PPP on 10 possessions.

1. is it predictive (particularly on out of sample data)?
2. is it redundant with other existing stats, or does it reveal something independent and interesting?
3. does it correlate with team success (in the form of stats like RAPM), and if so how much does it explain?

If (1) or (3) isn't true, the stat might still be interesting as an explanatory ""what happened"" stat, but it shouldn't be treated as any sort of ranking and probably wouldn't be super useful for coaches or players.  If (2) isn't true, the stat might be interesting but there should be a breakdown of how and why other stats explain it. || Interesting concept- obviously focused exclusively on volume scorers, but that’s fine … should perhaps just be more explicit, since someone like Jokic is penalized for creating opportunities for others despite his own very high efficiency.

I would also suggest that you don’t want a linear multiplier for possession type as there are limits to this (at least on a good team!) and it doesn’t account for pace of play. So maybe something related to percentage of teams possessions rather than absolute number? Then also scaled by differential to teammate ppp, so it reflects how much better the player is than his teammates?

Also a big one you’re missing is Chris Paul (Hornets were in the East then). Top 5 PG of all time came out of the East in your time frame. 

Edit: CPs first year was also the Hornets first year in West. Thanks for the correction. 

You also have guys like Halliburton and Brunson now who technically started in the west but blossomed in the east. So I am not sure that really counts for the west. || [removed] || The west tends to be the deeper conference in terms of okay to good teams.  Both conferences have about the same number of bad teams and great teams.  This creates a situation where bad teams in the east are making the 7th or 8th seed & getting playoff draft slots when better Western teams are getting lottery picks.  Usually the difference between the 12th or 16th draft pick isn't a big deal, but sometimes it matter, and over time the west has an advantage in talent acquisition. || Eastern US is older, and dominated more by Old Money. Old Money doesn't give a shit about being on the bleeding edge of tech, stats, competitiveness and they treat their teams as status symbols

Western US is new money, tech, etc.. these owners are more competitive, bigger risk takers, and always looking for an edge || Elite guard draft picks, 2010 onward:

2010: John Wall (East), Paul George (Both)
2011: Kyrie Irving (East), Klay Thompson (West), Kemba Walker (East), Isaiah Thomas (East)
2012: Damian Lillard (West), Bradley Beal (East)
2013: Victor Oladipo (East), CJ McCollum (West)
2014: Zach LaVine (East)
2015: D'Angelo Russell (Both), Devin Booker (West)
2016: Jaylen Brown (East), Dejounte Murray (Both), Jamal Murray (West)
2017: De'Aaron Fox (West), Donovan Mitchell (Both)
2018: Luka Doncic (West), Trae Young (East), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (West), Jalen Brunson (Both)
2019: Ja Morant (West), Darius Garland (East)
2020: LaMelo Ball (East), Anthony Edwards (West), Tyrese Haliburton (East)
2021: Cade Cunningham (East)


West - 10
East - 13
Both - 4

So in terms of quantity, it's actually the east that wins. The real reason western guards feel so much more superior is thanks to their top-end talent. These are what I would consider as the Top-2 guards of every season, 2010 onwards:

2010: Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant
2011: Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant
2012: Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant
2013: Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant
2014: Chris Paul, Stephen Curry
2015: Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook
2016: Stephen Curry, James Harden
2017: Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook
2018: Stephen Curry, James Harden
2019: Stephen Curry, James Harden
2020: Damian Lillard, James Harden
2021: Stephen Curry, James Harden
2022: Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic
2023: Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic

Out of all these players, 2021 James Harden was the only one in the east, AND he was traded from Houston mid-season.

The east never lacked talent, the west just always had the 2 best ones. || Almost certainly just small sample size. I haven't given any thought to whether you missed any top guards in the East, and to some extent who is categorized as a guard vs forward is random (Tatum for example could be a guard in my mind, or Jimmy Butler). But taking your hypothesis for fact, it's just a small sample size artifact in my mind. || I’ve said it before, Lebron wouldn’t have those rings if he didn’t play in weak East with a super team.

The Mickey Mouse ring I don’t count either.

It’s funny people give him a pass but they take credit away from Durant for his rings with warriors || I think if you are a player that can pick the destination the New York, Miami, and maybe Atlanta are realistically the only “destination” spots. The state of California alone trumps that. 

East coast is a lot different than the west coast. By volume the west should get the highest volume of players that choose to be there. 

East might create more bigs so theoretically it could be a climate affecting your game. That’s why a lot of natural shooters come out of Cali and dues who can dribble and finish inside paint come more from New York. 

There may be some cultural impact of the coasts but I would imagine it’s just luck for the most part || Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, John Wall, Bradley Beal, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry (although he started out West he became a star in Toronto), Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton

Then going further back you had Iverson, Vince Carter, McGrady, Penny Hardaway, Ray Allen, of course MJ, Isiah Thomas, Mark Price, Joe Dumars, Adrian Dantley, Gilbert Arenas

Just a few of the star guards out East that disprove your point. The East and West are closer in terms of guard talent than you think historically. It's just that the West since the 2000s has had better ownership, management and draft luck than the East. || The Eastern conference plays a muktop really crappy form of basketball. It is touted for defense but really it's more of a product of offensive inefficiency and lack of skill. The guard play in East is less than stellar.  || Jordan, Wade, Iverson, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Kidd, Kyrie, Billups, Hardaway, other Hardaway, Trae, Haliburton, Lowry, Rondo, Beal, Wall, Baron Davis, Rip Hamilton, Arenas, DeRozan all spent large amounts of time in the East. Not saying they stack up as much as the West, but when you also look at the overall talent of the West vs the East, they aren’t bad at all. || I think he's had a lot to do with the Warriors and Clippers recent success and was obviously instrumental during his Lakers tenure and time in Memphis putting together grit and grind with Conley there too. || Iirc new orleans hornets was in the west || Player above all of them guard wise in the east, Dwyane Wade. || Yeah when the West was significantly stronger than the East it also meant that the worst teams in the West would A) have an easier time losing enough to get high draft picks and B) be less likely to trade away picks due to the belief they were only one player away from a playoff run. I remember looking it up once but it was definitely 60+ percent of top-3 picks over a long timeframe that were made by West teams. || Brunson blossomed in Dallas, with his real breakthrough to stardom on the WCF run in 2021. He hasn't changed much from last year of Dallas to his time in NY, he just got a bigger role, sole control and more usage/shot attempts when he got away from playing next to Luka. He started older than most rookies and I think he came to NY pretty fully developed. 

As a Dallas fan, the big surprise was that he maintained how good he was even without Luka while becoming the primary focus of defensive attention and taking on a bigger workload. || Some of those players listed aren’t necessarily guards primarily such as VC || Yep. Lebron wouldn’t have those rings if he didn’t form a super team in the weak East.

Dirks 1 ring is worth more than his super team and Mickey Mouse ring || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || It’s also why Embid is averaging 36.

That and the best whistle in the league. You can’t tell me the back to back games he has vs Pistons/Wizards which are historically bad teams don’t help his stats || Oh you’re right. Their first year was CP’s rookie year.  I’ll edit that. Thanks. || Yeah I agree. OP mentions Wade though. I also debated Arenas as mentioning but I guess he technically counts as getting his start in the west. Just two years though. || Hasn’t changed much? He was nowhere near the player he is now in Dallas.

He didn’t really show full potential until the WCF and by then he was leaving anyways 

Charles Barkley and many others said no one thought he’d be this good, which is correct. 

Even Knicks fans thought they were overpaying for him T the time || It’s funny bc I left out McGrady because in my mind I consider him a SF. But in my mind I consider Vince a SG. If you look at their bball ref pages they get both are listed as SGs more often than SFs. Joe Johnson probably also fits there but I also checked. I think Pierce is the only one that’s definitely leans more SF than SG. But point taken for sure. A lot just comes down to semantics. || Pierce is the only person listed primarily as a forward. Everyone else is a guard until later years like vc who obviously slowed down. || They were established 2002. CPs rookie year was displaced to OKC in 2005. || As a Dallas fan, I knew he was this good. I just didn't know whether it was sustainable when not next to Luka. The field goal attempts went up, naturally, so his total scoring did but his success is not surprising. As a Dallas fan, I wanted to match or beat NY's money with an extra year. || Yeah. They started in the east though. Realigned so their first in the west was the same year as Paul’s rookie. || Hmmm. I did not know that. Thanks"
Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-01-31,nbadiscussion,1agutar,My pitch for a complete overhaul of position names,"I recently saw a poll asking the question; Who was the greater Point Guard, Chris Paul or Allen Iverson? As I expected, the comment section was littered with guys arguing about whether Iverson was a PG or a SG. I never understand why people get so argumentative about this subject because positional designations are basically just names at this point, they don’t really correspond to roles. JJ Redick and Lou Williams both played shooting guard but in no way shape or form were their offensive roles ever similar to each other. If you want to argue that Williams was a point guard then I ask how him and a guy like Kyle Lowry resemble each other? The general point I’m making is that these positional terminologies are outdated and don’t represent the roles of players in the modern NBA. So here’s what I purpose: a complete overhaul in positional designation for players.

First we need to identify unique player archetypes/roles. These would include;

-Primary on-ball shot creating guard
(Lou Williams/Kyrie Irving type)
-Primary on-ball facilitating guard
(Chris Paul/Rajon Rondo type)
-Primary on-ball hybrid guard
(Stephen Curry/Jamal Murray type)
-On-ball scoring wing
(Paul George/Paul Pierce)
-Facilitating wing
(Draymond Green/Ben Simmons)
-Slashing/cutting attacker wing
(Andre Iguodala/Harrison Barnes)
-Hybrid wing
(LeBron James/Scottie Barnes)
-Off-ball spot up shooters***
(JJ Redick/Buddy Hield type)
-Rim running pick & roll big
(Dwight Howard/Clint Capela)
-Scoring & shooting big
(Karl-Anthony Towns/Kristaps Porzingis)
-On-ball creating big
(Domantas Sabonis/Alperen Sengun)

*** = Note on Off-ball spot up shooters; can really be played by any player of any size so no need to make distinction between guard or wing

(I’d also like to make it clear that the player examples are only examples of offensive roles, not skillset. I am in no way claiming Scottie Barnes and LeBron James are in the same tier or skill level)

Okay so this is a lot to think about and obviously this would expand the number of total positions past the amount of players that can actually be on the floor at a given time. With that said, I think we need an overhaul that accurately represents what specific player roles actually are and what certain players actually do on the court. We need a name for the Duncan Robinsons of the world that differentiates him from Donovan Mitchell. So here’s where I need help…

What should these positions be called? 
Did I leave anything out?
What would you change?

Thanks for reading and I’m looking forward to feedback!",0,32,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1agutar/my_pitch_for_a_complete_overhaul_of_position_names/,2024-02-01 23:07:39,"Too confusing. 
Make it simpler. 
Positions are either a:

• PG, SG or a hybrid guard (Allen Iverson).  

• SF, PF, or hybrid forward (LeBron / Anthony Mason). 

• Center or hybrid center (can’t think of a good example at the moment except for Frenchie in San Antone) || Defining positions by what they do always breaks down with superstars who love doing more than what their position asks of them.

Lebron can cycle through every position in one possession, and you ask him about his position, and he's gonna say ""hooper"". || We at minimum need to acknowledge ""point"" is neither limited to guards nor is an accurate descriptor of the smallest guard on the court (the 1).

6'8 Luka and 6'9 Magic and LeBron are point forwards. Jokic is a point center. The offense runs through them.

Patrick Beverley is not a point guard, he's a 3&D 1 who is usually the smallest guard on court.

""Point"" needs to be movable, and positions should be duplicable. You can have the 1 shooting guard and a 2 shooting guard with no point guard. You can have multiple points at different positions (ex. Kyrie and Luka). || Just replace P and S with Primary and Secondary.  The Primary Guard/Forward would be the overall better player filling the  majority of skill/physical requirements of the position.  The Seconday Guard/Foward complents the Primary skill set. It's not perfect but I think fits modern basketball well enough. || Honestly, it’s just too much. If you are in an argument where you can use these terms, and the other person is understanding, you likely won’t be arguing rather AI is a PG or SG anyway.

But, I can agree that not all PGs or Cs or whatever are created equal, and it’s funny when people are like “this SF is better then this SF” and one is a tweener that can create really well but not defend and the other is a straight 3&D non creator lol. || It should just be guards, wings and bigs. 

Guards are the primary ball handlers and offensive creators, wings are guys who play on the perimeter on offense and defense without handling the ball as much as guards, and bigs are the ones who anchor the defense in the interior.

There would of course be some players who don't fit any of the molds but I'd say at least 90% of NBA players fall into one of those three descriptions || As outdated as positions are mostly these days, changing it makes even less sense. People are taught these positions from a young age and it's so set that all discussion come to an end if you bring up some weird new name for a position when talking with someone who is more of a casual fan. Anthony Davis doesn't want to be known as a center even though he basically played it at least half the time. Players get as caught up in the labels as much as anyone else. 

The outrage over labeling positions is weird. It's as much to identify what player type someone will guard typically as much as it is their role on offense. Star players can interchange offensively, but most people don't guard up or down as often (yes, within the game, there is some movement with switches) and will start out on similar-sized people. It's also to help people make clear comparisons where it doesn't get silly like college basketball, where most of the top scorers are all guards. Trae Young isn't a better basketball player than Bam. Yet if you went just counting stats, people would make that case. Positions aren't really that cut and dry and each is more of a malleable puzzle piece that needs to fit together. || Simplify it. Guards, wings, Bigs

Sub category 

Guards/Wings: offensive hub, 3-D, off ball, stationary shooter, movement shooter, defensive specialist 

Bigs Rim runner, offensive hub, 3-D, defensive anchor || https://www.bball-index.com/offensive-archetypes/


https://www.bball-index.com/defensive-roles/


Bball Index Offensive & Defensive Roles have helped me subtly categorize players better based off of their core competency 

I liked their role based archetypes from the perspective of how the sport is played today and it also includes the generic roles as well just with a lot more nuance. 

and you touch up on similar roles as well. || I think PG, SG, Combo guard, SF(swingman), point forward and Center are still valid. || Good idea but way too specific and puts people in crazy boxes like ""facilitating wing"" 
I say it should be 
Guard
Wing
Forward
Center 
Thats it || Joakim Noah was a hybrid Center in a way. || >hybrid center

AD, Sabonis, Duncan.and KG would be the first that come to mind.  Players that switch between C and PF depending on who else is on the floor. || I can jive with that I just still struggle with the Duncan Robinson, Max Strus, JJ Redick types. They’re just so uniquely their own thing. || Wolves have two “hybrid centers” in KAT and Naz Reid || That’s absolutely true and that’s mostly what the hybrids were for. Guys like LeBron, KD, and Bird totally break the system down. I’m not certain my way is the best way but I am certain that the current terminology needs to change || I definitely agree and that’s pretty much the exact logic I had with the term “creator”. Someone who distributes and creates high quality shot opportunities for themselves and others. || I really love that idea || I definitely agree that it’s too much and I want it simplified as well, I just think there has to be a better way of categorizing these guys || That’s awesome and super helpful, seems like the way actual teams in the league would categorize their players as well || KAT and Naz Reid also fit this billing imo || They are all the same type. Shooting guards that don't handle it. What is confusing about them? || Shooting wings/guards || Yeah one thing I’ve enjoyed with these archetypes is that during the playoffs when I’m trying to compare personnel between teams for a series. I can actually get a good grip of what the team lacks and what it offers in terms of play design by figuring players into those positions 


Makes the playoffs feel like positional chess matches a little bit. Sometimes games are a 3 point contests but there is a lot of nuance based on what kind of plays and personnel generate the different looks. 




Also since your mentioned about what the league uses. I know Synergy is used by multiple teams and they have a slightly deeper but more intuitive position categories that’s very similar to bball index too. 

I found these articles really fascinating on how they even came about making the categories -

I think their roles are so distinctly different from a Devin Booker or a Donovan Mitchell that it’s in effect a completely different position.

I have many friends who are Suns fans and they think they have a finals team because of the star talent but I always point to how much they are missing that other teams in the league have || Totally lol. I think they nailed it too! || Their roles are mostly the same. Just Booker and Mitchell do more as well. I think you are way overcomplicating this to an extent. Roles aren't set in stone.

WCJ is a good center for Orlando and provides some spacing for them, which they desperately need as the worst team in 3pt% and 4th worst in 3pta. Suggs has also proven to be the SG of the future for them, so Huerter would have to be a bench player. For Sacramento, they trade their starting SG for WCJ, who would be a weird fit with Sabonis as a starter, so he'd probably be a bench big for them. Wierd fits all around.

The formatting is confusing with #16. Is Detroit sending Stew, Bojan and Burks for Wiggins, GP2, Looney, and top 3 protected 1sts in 2026 and 2028, and a pick swap in 2029? Stew and Bojan could get 1sts and expirings in return, Burks could get the Pistons a couple of 2nds. The return for them being one of the worst contracts in the league in Wiggins. GP2, who I'm a big fan of, but he's struggled a lot with health concerns and is owed over 9 million next season, and his fit with Sasser isn't ideal. And Looney, who would be a downgrade from Stew at backup C and present major fit issues with Ausar due to being a non-shooter, and he has 3 mil guaranteed next season. For GS, this is the best they can hope for from a Wiggins, GP2, and Looney trade unless they prefer to go for expirings. And even then, it takes up a lot of their flexibility. It may just be best to move towards a rebuild instead of tying up their future to win now. 

Also on #22 you have Atlanta sending Bojan instead of Bogdan Bogdanovic. Also, Atlanta hangs up immediately. Taking on Tuckers contract alone isn't worth that 2nd, much less Bogdan Bogdanovic. Mann is a fine player, but a big downgrade from Bogdan.


Brooklyn doesn't do #23. They already are set at SG with Cam Thomas and Lonnie Walker. Trading DFS for a 1st would be better instead of Levert and a swap would be better imo. That should open up some minutes for young guys like Dariq Whitehead.

I don't see why Charlotte does #25. Wiseman is worthless. One of, if not the worst player in the entire league. Gallo has been decent in Detroit, though. But 2 2nds and 1 2nd round swap isn't enough to fill the gap in value between Gallo and Washington. || Don't think Nuggets would do #3. Drummond wouldn't see the floor in the playoffs so I doubt they'd trade a promising young player for him. || as a nuggets fan, not a chance we trade peyton watson. he’s been in commercials with jokic, he’s on a great contract, he’s a great personality and he has been consistently getting better + malone loves him

he’s also home grown which is a big part of nuggets culture || I mean this would be the most active trade deadline… maybe ever? Especially with multiple teams making multiple deals changing their rotations.

I think in reality most of the teams trading the better player (especially under contract for multiple years) would just wait until the draft/FA to deal these guys when the returns would be better.

This also goes too far in the direction of teams severely undervaluing their own players. GSW is not trading all that for Caruso/Beef Stew/Bogi/Burks just to end up in the play-in. SAC would not trade out of their wing depth to add a C who can’t play next to Sabonis and a volume scorer who doesn’t defend who also takes touches from Fox. HOU doesn’t punt on Green for maybe one halfway decent 1st, if you think TOR is going to suck next year, and TOR protects their own pick 1-4 in a better draft

The better trades are Brogdon to NYK, Monte to MIN and I guess Cody Martin for Obi Toppin. Those feel the most realistic.

If you erase the WCJ trade, the Dejounte trade to ORL isn’t bad. Dunno if he’s the PG upgrade they’d think of him to be in order to spend their assets though.

Kuzma is about the last player I’d expect OKC to trade for. Especially not if DFS can be had for as little as a pick swap and matching salary, or WCJ is available, or PJ Washington for 2nds || The hawks reject #2 quick, they’re not trading Murray for a Denver pick, a protected pick in 3 yrs  and Isaac lol || 1:One of y’all hates the Warriors with a passion.

2:Massive overpay for Lavine

3:Insane overpay for Clarkson 

4:Clippers steal Bojan

5:DET steals PJ

The only ones I like is the Murray Magic one, Bogdon seems like a given atp, and Kuzma to OKC seems like a good move if they want to improve now while still being able to move his contract for a better player. || Yeah #11 is awful, I wouldn't give up Bertrans cap flexibly in a trade in  addition to two first round picks for Kuzma, he doesn't solve our rebounding issue ans he takes too many shots at not a great efficiency. || POR doesn't want more 2024 picks that they don't have room for. Or, picks that are never likely to convey. 

POR also may not be interested in trading Mookie Dew this year after all. 

Again, POR doesn't have room for four picks on the roster in 2024, unless Mookie Dew goes out for an expiring, and POR uses 10 days to fill out the 14th spot for the rest of the season, not converting any more 2WP players... So if Mookie Dew were to be moved, maybe POR wants to include the 2024 2RP's, for guaranteed FRP assets in the 25-28 years.

POR is also not trying to trade JG. JG is not asking to be traded. He's not ""taking minutes"" from anyone. There is nobody who is anywhere near his level on the roster. Once again, POR doesn't have room for these players they don't want.

As I expected, the comment section was littered with guys arguing about whether Iverson was a PG or a SG. I never understand why people get so argumentative about this subject because positional designations are basically just names at this point, they don’t really correspond to roles. JJ Redick and Lou Williams both played shooting guard but in no way shape or form were their offensive roles ever similar to each other. If you want to argue that Williams was a point guard then I ask how him and a guy like Kyle Lowry resemble each other? The general point I’m making is that these positional terminologies are outdated and don’t represent the roles of players in the modern NBA. So here’s what I purpose: a complete overhaul in positional designation for players.

First we need to identify unique player archetypes/roles. These would include;

-Primary on-ball shot creating guard
(Lou Williams/Kyrie Irving type)
-Primary on-ball facilitating guard
(Chris Paul/Rajon Rondo type)
-Primary on-ball hybrid guard
(Stephen Curry/Jamal Murray type)
-On-ball scoring wing
(Paul George/Paul Pierce)
-Facilitating wing
(Draymond Green/Ben Simmons)
-Slashing/cutting attacker wing
(Andre Iguodala/Harrison Barnes)
-Hybrid wing
(LeBron James/Scottie Barnes)
-Off-ball spot up shooters***
(JJ Redick/Buddy Hield type)
-Rim running pick & roll big
(Dwight Howard/Clint Capela)
-Scoring & shooting big
(Karl-Anthony Towns/Kristaps Porzingis)
-On-ball creating big
(Domantas Sabonis/Alperen Sengun)

*** = Note on Off-ball spot up shooters; can really be played by any player of any size so no need to make distinction between guard or wing

(I’d also like to make it clear that the player examples are only examples of offensive roles, not skillset. I am in no way claiming Scottie Barnes and LeBron James are in the same tier or skill level)

Okay so this is a lot to think about and obviously this would expand the number of total positions past the amount of players that can actually be on the floor at a given time. With that said, I think we need an overhaul that accurately represents what specific player roles actually are and what certain players actually do on the court. We need a name for the Duncan Robinsons of the world that differentiates him from Donovan Mitchell. So here’s where I need help…

What should these positions be called? 
Did I leave anything out?
What would you change?

Make it simpler. 
Positions are either a:

• PG, SG or a hybrid guard (Allen Iverson).  

• SF, PF, or hybrid forward (LeBron / Anthony Mason). 

• Center or hybrid center (can’t think of a good example at the moment except for Frenchie in San Antone) || Defining positions by what they do always breaks down with superstars who love doing more than what their position asks of them.

Lebron can cycle through every position in one possession, and you ask him about his position, and he's gonna say ""hooper"". || We at minimum need to acknowledge ""point"" is neither limited to guards nor is an accurate descriptor of the smallest guard on the court (the 1).

6'8 Luka and 6'9 Magic and LeBron are point forwards. Jokic is a point center. The offense runs through them.

Patrick Beverley is not a point guard, he's a 3&D 1 who is usually the smallest guard on court.

""Point"" needs to be movable, and positions should be duplicable. You can have the 1 shooting guard and a 2 shooting guard with no point guard. You can have multiple points at different positions (ex. Kyrie and Luka). || Just replace P and S with Primary and Secondary.  The Primary Guard/Forward would be the overall better player filling the  majority of skill/physical requirements of the position.  The Seconday Guard/Foward complents the Primary skill set. It's not perfect but I think fits modern basketball well enough. || Honestly, it’s just too much. If you are in an argument where you can use these terms, and the other person is understanding, you likely won’t be arguing rather AI is a PG or SG anyway.

But, I can agree that not all PGs or Cs or whatever are created equal, and it’s funny when people are like “this SF is better then this SF” and one is a tweener that can create really well but not defend and the other is a straight 3&D non creator lol. || It should just be guards, wings and bigs. 

Guards are the primary ball handlers and offensive creators, wings are guys who play on the perimeter on offense and defense without handling the ball as much as guards, and bigs are the ones who anchor the defense in the interior.

There would of course be some players who don't fit any of the molds but I'd say at least 90% of NBA players fall into one of those three descriptions || As outdated as positions are mostly these days, changing it makes even less sense. People are taught these positions from a young age and it's so set that all discussion come to an end if you bring up some weird new name for a position when talking with someone who is more of a casual fan. Anthony Davis doesn't want to be known as a center even though he basically played it at least half the time. Players get as caught up in the labels as much as anyone else. 

The outrage over labeling positions is weird. It's as much to identify what player type someone will guard typically as much as it is their role on offense. Star players can interchange offensively, but most people don't guard up or down as often (yes, within the game, there is some movement with switches) and will start out on similar-sized people. It's also to help people make clear comparisons where it doesn't get silly like college basketball, where most of the top scorers are all guards. Trae Young isn't a better basketball player than Bam. Yet if you went just counting stats, people would make that case. Positions aren't really that cut and dry and each is more of a malleable puzzle piece that needs to fit together. || Simplify it.

Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-02-03,nbadiscussion,1ahpa7m,"New 28 year coach RAPM, evidence coaches influence defense more than players, and triple-adjusted player RAPM follow-up","These three related topics are all from recent Jeremias Engelmann tweets about his work with RAPM. For those unfamiliar, RAPM is a plus minus stat adjusted for everyone on the court, and is the most predictive player stat which doesn't use any box score data. Engelmann has worked in the analytics departments of multiple NBA teams, is one of the original pioneers of RAPM, and invented RPM.

#**28 year Coach RAPM**

This non-traditional version of RAPM treats coaches like a 6th man on the court to estimate their impact, and is rubber-band and player age adjusted (more on those adjustments later). 

As Engelmann points out [in his tweet,](https://twitter.com/JerryEngelmann/status/1753208530591793367) it should be taken with a grain of salt. The largest issue is something called collinearity, which in this case basically means that because the coach is always considered on the court, there is limited ""off-court"" data to compare with (basically when their players play for other coaches), which makes it tougher for the regression to tease out player vs coach effects. This is especially bad for those who coached less years or less players, so more caution should be had interpreting those results. 

That being said, I think this is a very interesting stat, especially since coach impact can be quite difficult to judge any other way. 

**Here are the top 20 coaches from 1997 to 2024 in RAPM:**

|+|Coach|Offense|Defense|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Phil Jackson|2.4|-4.2|6.6|
|2|Mike Fratello|0.1|-4.7|4.8|
|3|Jeff Van Gundy|-0.3|-4.8|4.5|
|4|Tom Thibodeau|0.4|-4.1|4.4|
|5|Ime Udoka|0.8|-3.4|4.2|
|6|Scott Skiles|0.3|-3.9|4.2|
|7|Larry Bird|0.5|-3.2|3.8|
|8|Billy Donovan|1.5|-2.2|3.7|
|9|Michael Malone|1.5|-2.1|3.6|
|10|Steve Kerr|1.8|-1.8|3.5|
|11|Mike Budenholzer|0.8|-2.6|3.4|
|12|Stan Van Gundy|0.2|-3.1|3.3|
|13|Doc Rivers|0.6|-2.6|3.2|
|14|Brad Stevens|0.7|-2.4|3.1|
|15|Mike Brown|0.4|-2.7|3.1|
|16|Jim O'Brien|0.1|-3|3.1|
|17|Doug Collins|0.4|-2.5|2.9|
|18|Gregg Popovich|0.5|-2.3|2.7|
|19|George Karl|1.4|-1.3|2.7|
|20|Hubie Brown|1.2|-1.5|2.7|

Here's a link to the full spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aCMwq4qu_m1-Tzc63CmRxQ2H9qq5vFUMpZViJanPxfw/

Interesting to see Jackson so far ahead. The top 3 active coach list of Thibodeau, Udoka, and Donovan(!) is surprising. Popovich (18th of 182) and Spoelstra (25th) aren't as high up as expected. Billups ranks 182nd out of 182 at -6.1, with the next lowest active coach being Jacque Vaughn at -1.5.

#**Evidence that coaches influence defense more than players**

The above data shows that coaches are having a large effect on defense, much more than offense. I'll quote [Engelmann's tweets](https://twitter.com/JerryEngelmann/status/1753207144235811196) for the next part:

>**tldr:** 

>Coaches, if treated as a 6th man on the court, have more influence on the defensive performance of a team, than players do.

>Knowing who the coach is, will lead to better prediction results of a 5-man unit's defensive performance, than knowing who the 5 players are

>**Technical details:** 

>In penalized regression we determine certain factors (""alphas"") that indicate the level of noise/information for certain variables. Lower values mean less noise: we will allow more movement for that variable's coefficient. 

>For players, these values have hovered around 3k, usually slightly lower on off.

>We can determine these factors for every ""variable group"" {players off, players def, coach off, coach def} separately, using crossvalidation to determine which set of alphas leads to best predictions

>This led to the following alphas:

>Players Off: 2000

>Players Def: 8000

>Coaches Off: 8000

>Coaches Def: 2000

>**Issues with this approach:**

>- it's not crediting the coach for playing the best players (only for influencing those that do play)

>- age influence is assumed to be the same for everyone (could work around this but need more RAM)

>- a coach is assumed to ""perform the same"" no matter how many years the data points are apart

From that explanation, the huge data set, the size of the effect, and Engelmann's reputation, this is a very strong/robust result. I've always thought coaches had a big impact on defense but for it to be significantly more than players (in the NBA over these years) is surprising. I also think it's interesting that coaches appear to have more influence on defense by the same amount that players have more influence on offense. 

#**Triple-adjusted 28 year player RAPM**

This part of the post is a follow-up to the unadjusted 28 year RAPM that was posted here 3 days ago. That post also has a good explanation of how to interpret player RAPM numbers, basically like a much better version of on/off: https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1aextmx/new_lifetime_rapm_rankings_1997_includes_playoffs/

This time around there are three major adjustments [as listed in Engelmann's tweet](https://twitter.com/JerryEngelmann/status/1753210719741604261). 

First is the rubber-band adjustment, which compensates for the fact that teams play significantly better when they are losing and worse when they are winning. [Here's a cool visual of this effect](https://twitter.com/inpredict/status/1650150071382704130) which compares results to point spreads, while Engelmann's adjustment is made by comparing results to predictions from unadjusted RAPM. 

Second every player's performance is adjusted for age. [Engelmann's explanation:](https://twitter.com/JerryEngelmann/status/1753268851654140012) ""I compute coefficients for age dummy variables, then do weighed polynomial fit on the results"". 

Third there is a coach adjustment based on the RAPM values shown earlier in this post.

The goal of these adjustments [according to Engelmann:](https://twitter.com/JerryEngelmann/status/1753210719741604261)

>It tries to answer ""who would be the best if everyone was the same age""

**Here are the top 20 players in this adjusted 1997-2024 RAPM:**

Lebron easily takes the top spot, with KG in second due to by far the best defense. People don't make enough of the fact that CP3 looks way better than consensus in both purely plus minus and purely box score stats which are completely independent from each other. 

Stockton rising the most in the top 20 compared to the unadjusted RAPM shows how well he aged, but probably shouldn't be taken at face value since there are no prime years included. Draymond's large drop and Steph's modest rise make the list look more realistic.

Thank you for linking it and the writeup.  

Time to update your resume for Coach Bud and Jefferino Hot Dog Buddy.  Chauncey Billips in last place, yikes. 

I wonder if you added different home stadiums/crowds or referees as additional ""players"" if there would be any interesting takeaways. I'd expect the best referees to be closer to zero impact but since they're not on either team I have no idea how you'd measure that. Maybe look at their impact for each team separately and then roll those into one number.  

One of the things I've always wondered re:modern stats is how complete/incomplete the historical video library is before 1997, and how hard it would be to retro-score those games for play-by-play data.  Obviously the farther back you go the more incomplete but I wouldn't be surprised if there was a near complete archive going back to the mid-80's. || I would love to understand more of how this stat is calculated for both players and coaches. But based on what I’ve understood from you here, I would imagine that the reason Phil Jackson is such an outlier is because he coached Jordan so long and through all his winningest seasons, which were all outlier teams (for good reason) and then again Kobe for his winningest seasons too. 

Jackson definitely deserves the credit he gets for coaching both Bulls and Lakers to such great heights, but he was also bolstered by great rosters, and more so in this stat because (correct me if I’m wrong) the “off” for Kobe and MJ were their worst seasons. || Coaches having more of an impact on defense has been shown before and is intuitive where there’s not much separating the best and worst coaches in the leagues in terms of Xs and Os. Even if you thought there was, A) these people have whole staffs working with them where it’s very unlikely that any strategic decision is 100% on them, and B) the very best offensive players can execute a variety of offenses well enough to get teams great results and obviously have more of an effect than the coach, who isn’t going to put together a top offense with no great offensive players. 

Defense, especially in the regular season, is more about effort than offense so it’s easier to get the whole to be more than the sum of its parts. Again, there is not that much of a difference in Xs and Os acumen between the coaching staffs of various NBA teams, so the difference between getting a motivated versus unmotivated Rodman/Shaq/Kobe etc. makes more of a difference than some awesome defensive scheme (that basically everyone else will immediately start copying if it works well enough). 

It’s also an interesting dynamic at hand where a lot of these top defensive coaches have a reputation for getting short-term results but run through players wear out their welcome relatively quickly - in other words, they’re tough to deal with even when the on-court results are good, so once their schemes are no longer as effective it doesn’t take as much time for them to be ousted. In that way they are kind of the equivalent of a player who retires at 32 rather than 38. 


It definitely also makes a Thibs type of coach look better by this metric where if you run someone into the ground for 40+ minutes a night, odds are they’ll have some injury issues that will make them less effective players for whoever coaches them next. Otherwise just looking at the numbers it would clearly seem to be a ‘Moneyball’ strategy to hire the most hard-ass coach who will get players to compete on defense and replace him with another one when players start to tune him out, but common sense says there would obviously be diminishing returns to this where players wouldn’t have anything left in the tank.

Even that motivating effect is hard to separate from that of a top player - it’s relatively common to see a player sandbagging it for a bad team and then doing much better that season when they’re traded to a team with a shot at the title, and you obviously need stars in place to win titles. The ‘04 Pistons are the one team people love to hold up as a counterexample but aside from being the one exception over the last however many decades, someone like Ben Wallace actually was a strong enough defender to rank among the top 10 players in overall RAPM.

A nice way to see the general competence of NBA coaching staffs illustrated is that when you look at the correlation between various individual stats and RAPM, something as simple as minutes per game tends to be more strongly correlated than any other individual box score stat and even composite ones like PER or BPM.  This ability of NBA coaches to identify who the most helpful players are and give them more minutes is almost certainly underestimated by quite a bit where most of the coaches whose teams have the least correlation between playing time and plus-minus impact were playing those lineups to tank rather than because they genuinely thought those were their best players. In other words, a big part of why RAPM is low on Chauncey Billups as a coach because it feels he is playing Scoot Henderson way too much relative to someone like Malcolm Brogdon. || it's interesting, although i'm not sure how accurate coaching RAPM can possibly be. like the author said, you don't have data with the coach ""off the floor"". || I don't know about Draymond's large drop being a good thing. He's got 100% collinearity with Steve Kerr. Hard to disentangle the two, and he should get the credit. It only looks more realistic because of anti-defense bias. || It's an interesting idea, and I generally can agree with the actual sentiment it's expressing, but the stat itself seems questionable. Any stat that has someone like Billy Donovan as a coach higher than Pop or Spoelstra seems like it's lacking something. And any player value stat that has Manu as the 6th best player of the last 30 years is equally suspicious. He was great, but he should not be that high, even over Duncan. || Really interesting- my question is around biases with coaching elite players in their prime. For example Phil Jackson coaching MJ his entire prime then MJ goes to the Wiz and declines with age… is that a benefit for Jackson and a negative for whoever coached him in Washington?

It would work much better for Doc who has coached a number of teams with players all over the map in terms of age and development || Jordan was a worse defender than Steph curry? || I know Justin Jacobs is someone who’s taken a stab at it. He used to work in the analytics department of some teams, maybe he still does now. Some years have lots of games tabulated this way, but obviously it’s a lot easier to come across games involving the Bulls/Celtics/Lakers back then compared to like Minnesota vs. Dallas in 1991. 

Home court has been pretty thoroughly analyzed in my eyes. I forget where, but it was even looking at stuff like days of rest, length of road trip, tracking data to see how fast players were moving, etc. Basically every home court advantage is about the same other than Denver and then Utah due to altitude. For everywhere else the homecourt advantage pretty much boils down to one extra call per game going to the home team. || > I would love to understand more of how this stat is calculated

>Phil Jackson, Kobe, MJ, etc.

Keep in mind this data set starts in 1997, so there's not a ton of Jordan Bulls in this sample. 

PJ did get Kobe's best years, but also the aging model doesn't expect teenagers or players in their mid 30s to be good, so the model would expect PJ to get Kobe's best years. Similarly MJ was still pretty good at 38/39 when players are not expected to be good, so it's difficult to say how much that is really helping PJ. Ultimately I would expect the other ~hundred or however many players who played for PJ during these years to collectively have much more impact than these two specific players. || I think there's a lot of evidence in favor of the model not just elevating coaches who had great lineups:

* Other dynasty coaches like Pop and Kerr, while still in the top 20, are not outliers. 
* Adrian Griffin and Joe Mazzula are both among the highest winning percentage coaches since '97 but aren't that high here.  
* Other top guys like Fratello and Skiles never had uber lineups. || midseason coaching changes is the closest you'd get

not sure if JE included coaching absences || This isn't really saying Manu is the 6th best in the last 30 years.

First, this is all per possession, and Ginobili could play harder by averaging 25 mpg over his career. He played substantially less minutes than most of the other top players because of this, and if there was a total impact type list (which arguably maps closer to ""best player"") he would rank lower. 

Second, Manu was a good player to age 40, and quite productive in his late 30s, which is kind of a cheat code in this age-adjusted format because of how rare it is. He was 12th in the unadjusted version. 

Third, this isn't a player ranking, it's an RAPM ranking. A lot of its usefulness comes from it being independent from box score and eye test, so you can combine it with those types of things to get a more cohesive picture. Nobody is supposed to look at this and think Ginobili is the 6th best player, they should look at it and think Ginobili is probably better than they previously thought. This is also an important point with the coaches list, which is substantially less accurate than the players list.

And lastly, I don't think it should be surprising Manu would rank high in this even if 6th is a stretch, given the advantages listed above, the fact that he's 15th in purely box score BPM over this period, and that he was the second best player on a major dynasty spanning much of this period. || No. You cannot draw accurate conclusions of MJ's career off a dataset that only considers his elderly years. That wasn't the point of this post. || Yeah, and Kobe Bryant was only the 120th best player during that era. I don't mean to dismiss someone's work, but anyone with eyes would disagree with those assessments. || Thinking Basketball also released an interesting video a few months ago on how underrated Manu Ginobili is, which these stats might support.

https://youtu.be/o9XbDCXLE94?si=XbchyTx7SYHcYYdg || I wouldn’t, this looks at every season from 1997 on so Kobe had some bad years at the end (and also the beginning, obviously starting his career at 18 tacked on more substandard years relative to his peak years than if he’d been 21 as a rookie) that dragged him down and most of Jordan’s best years weren’t included in it.

Also your eye test isn’t the best. Kobe was never better than an average defender once Shaq left and he had to be the #1 option on offense. Defense is about keeping the other team from scoring points, and when you pout because your teammate didn’t pass you the ball or miss a tough shot and complain to the ref instead of getting back on defense, that’s the worst possible defense anyone can play on a given possession and doesn’t need to happen more than a time or two per game to cancel out the benefit of a lot of good individual defensive possessions. || Kobe has never had anywhere near the same statistical impact as other top 15 players. He's got a flashy style and a bunch of rings (good playoff performer with inelastic offense). But in overall impact he is heavily overrated. || Ok, lets say my eyes are the worst in the world, that's fine. 

But Kobe's post achilles minutes were about 7% of his career, that was enough to put Kobe as a worse player than CJ McCollum, Joe Ingles, Derek Fisher, etc?

I respect the work, but something is broken in the formula if that's the conclusion, imo || Yeah, I think you are underestimating that he was one of the worst players in the league for a couple seasons at the end (and of course he was not the greatest player at the very beginning where he was voted as an all star starter a year he wasn’t even starting on his own team).  

Like one season of being a top-5 player and one season of being the worst player in the league cancel each other out and become two years of being a completely average player by this objective metric. In your mind you are naturally gonna count those farewell tour seasons as less important, but in actuality that ‘only’ 7% of his career post Achilles is more like double that where in RAPM’s eyes he was taking away some of the value he’d added up to that point rather than simply no longer adding. 

You can look back at those Laker teams towards the end and see more talent than most 17-win teams with young players like Russell and Randle who eventually became all-stars, a center like Hibbert who had been making a positive defensive impact, and scorers like Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson who bookended that Lakers stint with making a positive impact on playoff teams. He attempted 3 more shots per game than the #2 player on on the list despite shooting such awful percentages that he had nearly twice as many games shooting 25%  or below from the field than 50% or above.

The other major thing in play is that long-term RAPM stats tend to do a better job of estimating defensive impact. There are of course lots of actions we agree would count as good defense that aren’t measured by any box score stats, whereas on offense I think it’s somewhat common sense that the ability to make shots (which can be measured well enough with some combination of shooting volume and efficiency) already gets most of the way to what makes a player good on offense.   

These stats have been pretty consistent in showing that the most impactful defensive bigs have more of an impact on that end than the best guards, so right off the bat whatever you consider great versus average perimeter defense makes less of a difference than you think. This is somewhat intuitive as you can keep your own man from scoring but that doesn’t matter much if the other team has a mismatch else where and you can’t offer help defense. So what ends up happening is there’s a cumulative effect where most of Kobe’s key teammates besides Shaq were defensively oriented and therefore just a touch underrated, which RAPM sees when a Lamar Odom or Derek Fisher plays on a different team and also help those other teams give up points at a lower rate when they’re in the game versus not.   


On top of that Kobe was not the most effective perimeter defender. Sure he had possessions where he could lock someone up, but defense is about consistency where good defense that doesn’t rise to the level of forcing a miss/turnover by yourself doesn’t benefit your team as much a missed gamble or not getting back in transition because you were arguing with the ref about a call/attempted some super difficult shot that left you falling out of bounds hurts it. When he didn’t have Shaq to take most of the opposing team’s attention on defense, he didn’t have the energy to be as consistent. Like you could say he turned up his Mamba Mentality for matchups that mattered/the playoffs and was better defensively then, but that’s the same as saying he wasn’t giving his full effort on defense so why would you be arguing with a stat that is obviously looking at both regular season and playoffs?    

Another thing that messes with people is that there are certain elements of the game where it’s pretty arbitrary whether you’d count them as offense or defense. Players with bad shot selection often show up as worse defenders than a lot of people’s eye test indicates; here I don’t even mean bad shot selection in a “Kobe should’ve  taken more threes instead of long twos” sense, just that players who freelance and break off their team’s offense tend to have more of their misses be fundamentally equivalent to turnovers because their teammates who weren’t expecting a shot to go up were a step slow in getting back on defense.   

On the other end of the spectrum there are players like John Stockton and Chris Paul where by being all-time greats at managing the tempo of a game and getting their teammates lots of quality shots without turning the ball over, they were cumulatively denying their opponents a lot of fast break opportunities. Those players will rank higher defensively and overall than your eye test will think (this happens to Jokic too where he is likely even better at this relative to the average center than CP3/Stockton are to the average point guard), and it’s interesting where when you go back and do player RAPM on years prior to 1997, a lot of future NBA coaches like Doc Rivers, Nate McMillan, Fisher, and probably some others I’m not remembering off the top of my head fit this bill.

So basically there is some shot selection/avoiding turnovers aspect that tends to arbitrarily fall under defense in plus-minus stats (I guess you could say it’s measuring a player’s ability to preemptively organize his team’s defense in the event of a change of possession), but if you were to take that part and put it under offense it would give players the same overall plus-minus while making you happier about it aligning with your eye test of players’ defense.  

I think that would make it clearer to people where instead of getting worked up about how Kobe’s defense compares to Steph Curry’s, they could see “oh wow a lot of the players we consider the best passers of all time are way up there in offensive/overall RAPM, maybe the actual impact of being an amazing passer is underrated compared to taking a more individualistic approach on offense.” At that point it’s similar to defense where maybe you could argue that Kobe cleaned this up in the playoffs, but then why argue with something that is showing Kobe could do it but didn’t do it consistently? || We're not talking about post-achilles minutes, we're talking about ALL of his post-Shaq minutes.

The Lakers were dead last in the league in defense the year after Shaq left.

That's not something that happens if Kobe was truly an all-Defensive caliber player at that time.

You may also notice, that immediately after that year, Phil Jackson came back and suddenly the Lakers were up to #15 defense.

That is why this ranking greatly likes Phil Jackson as the by-far greatest coach of all time and sees him as the mastermind behind the Lakers good defense.

The entire point of this post is that coaches have more impact on defense than players.

Kobe's defense, which was already just average statistically, was further uplifted by the all-time-great defensive coaching of Phil Jackson. || Very well said!!! Excellent post!!! || Kobe is pretty mid even when you look at 5 year peaks instead of the full sample. 23rd best on this list:

Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-02-05,nbadiscussion,1akgdr2,Victor Wembanyama is mounting a pretty ******* good case for Defensive Player of the Year [OC Analysis],"  
I have never seen a player improve as rapidly at something as Victor Wembanyama has improved at NBA defense.  
  
Not that he was bad to start — he’s been good since day one! Wembanyama flashed his court-guzzling defensive prowess right from the preseason, gobbling up entire possessions like a basketball [Galactus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactus): \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]  
  
But there’s a difference between having a good season and having an all-time great season. He’s closing in on the latter.  
  
A few weeks ago, I said that “defensively, Wembanyama [could’ve swept last year’s Oscars](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-wins-7-oscars-2023-1235349378/): he’s everything, everywhere, all at once.” That may have understated his impact.  
  
*\[Hi, all! As always, I've collected a whole bunch of video clips for this one. They can be* [*viewed in-context here*](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)*. I think they add a lot to the post, so check them out!\]*  
  
Wemby’s 3.1 blocks per game lead the association, and his 1.2 steals per game are 19th in the league (he’s the only center in the top 20, although Nikola Jokic is right behind him). Nobody comes close to those combined numbers no matter how you regularize them (although, shout out to Andre Drummond, an old-school center [leading the league in per-possession steals](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_per_poss.html), and Walker Kessler, who slightly edges Wemby in blocks per possession). For what it’s worth, [the Spurs recover 66% of Wemby’s block](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/player?Season=2023-24&SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason)s, the top mark of the most prolific shotblockers (by a fraction of a fraction over fellow rookie Chet Holmgren, having an All-Defensive-caliber season of his own).  
  
Notably, he’s blocking all these shots without getting into foul trouble: his [minuscule 2.9% foul rate](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/5213#tab-defense_rebounding) compares favorably to Rudy Gobert, Holmgren, Brook Lopez, and most other elite big-man defenders you can name — and that’s as a rookie! Newbie bigs almost always struggle with foul trouble as they navigate the complexities of NBA-level pick-and-roll defense. Instead, we have Wemby toying with ballhandlers and doing stuff like this: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]  
  
If that’s too basic for your tastes, the alphabet stew all-in-one stats are just as kind as the traditional metrics. For players with at least 500 minutes played, he currently ranks [sixth in D-EPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm), third in Bball-Index’s [D-LEBRON](https://www.bball-index.com/leaderboards-tool/), and seventh in Neil Paine’s [defensive eRAPTOR](https://neilpaine.substack.com/p/nba-estimated-raptor-player-ratings). While all of those acronyms have various strengths and weaknesses, Wembanyama and Knicks’ backup center Isaiah Hartenstein (performing fantastically in Mitchell Robinson’s absence) are the only players in the league to be top-10 in all three. If every directional indicator points the same way, you can feel better about the conclusion.  
  
And remember that Wemby played much of the season out of position and is still surrounded by nervous-matador teammates. These dudes are dying on screens like randy teens in a slasher flick. How does Wembanyama cope when this is what he’s faced with every game? \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]  
  
The breakdown: Malaki Branham (#22 on the Spurs) is one of the worst defenders in basketball. Setting a screen essentially hits the delete button on Branham for any given possession, as you see above (it’s hilarious that Branham flips his hands up as if he’s frustrated by his teammates). Julian Champagnie (#30) is usually better but misses his job this time. He’s supposed to “tag” the rolling big man by bumping him to make the roll to the rim more difficult. Instead, like my toddler helping with the chores, neither of those players does anything remotely useful. Wemby is put into an untenable 2-on-1 situation that ends in an easy alley-oop for Bismack Biyombo.  
  
This happens *all the time*. Further proof: when Wembanyama is resting, the [Spurs give up 124 points per 100 possessions](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/27/lineups?off=5213#tab-four_factors), an awful figure. For context, the Clippers have the best offensive rating in league history right now, and they’re cracking 122 points per 100.  
  
In other words, whenever Wemby folds himself onto a tiny bench chair, the Spurs transform opposing offenses into the Dream Team. But the Spurs give up fewer than 115 points per 100 when Wemby’s on the floor, a slightly above-average mark. He transforms one of the worst defenses in the league into something more than respectable.  
  
That’s primarily due to scaring the shi\*t out of opposing ballhandlers. He’s in[the 98th percentile for reducing opponent shots at the rim](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/5213/onoff#tab-opp_shooting_freq), and teams shoot less accurately when they do get there, too. [Opponents shoot just 52% at the rim against Wembanyama](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact?CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*50&dir=A&sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT), the same mark as Rudy Gobert, and according to Second Spectrum, Wembanyama [lowers the probability of an opponent’s shot converting](https://twitter.com/Adam_Mares/status/1754745764813685189) by a greater percentage than anyone in the NBA.  
  
Statistically, there’s a powerful argument that Wemby’s the best defender in the NBA right now, and many of those same numbers have only gotten better since the first month-ish of the season (give or take a midseason minutes restriction).  
  
I know that was a metric ton of metrics, so let’s turn to the tape. Film shows the improvement. Coming into the season, a knock on Wemby was that he was too easy to shift off-balance, and his hips were slow to turn. This outrageous deflection would beg otherwise: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]  
  
Look how quickly he spins and re-locates the pass to knock it away! Few big men are that quick to react.  
  
Wemby can change his orientation with startling alacrity. And like the best shot-blockers, he’s not scared to get yammed on. You don’t average three blocks by regularly making business decisions: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]  
  
Wembanyama is not some lumbering oaf bound to the paint like Mona Lisa, either. He skitters across the court, arms wide like some nightmarish shot-eating crab. Chris Paul learned this the hard way when he tried to get to his pet pull-up from the right elbow to end a quarter, only to panic and fling the ball at the rafters when Wemby apparated in front of him: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]  
  
Wembanyama is still learning, but his margin for error is like playing a video game in story mode. Here, he falls for an initial shoulder fake by Scoot Henderson but gets the block anyway: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]  
  
At the beginning of the season, Wembanyama struggled with the timing of when to help and when to stay home. He’d chase blocks he could not get, then watch a driver go right by him without offering much resistance. But he’s starting to find the balance. He’s singlehandedly destroying possessions by himself. Watch as he stonewalls Giannis Antetokounmpo, then Lopez, then Lopez again, then Giannis for good measure: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]  
  
Not many defenders can absorb a full-speed Giannis shoulder and live to tell the tale, much less become the hero: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]  
  
The biggest players can still mash Wembanyama under the basket, but he’s far stronger than he looks, and he's willowy enough to absorb the blow but still alter shots.  
  
The scary thing is that there are clear areas for further refinement. Wembanyama tends to close out really high on shooters. It certainly dissuades them from launching, but it can take him completely out of the play (and few Spurs can be counted on to provide much help): \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]  
  
Wemby occasionally misses box-outs, relying upon his tree branches to corral rebounds. He’s only been so-so in isolation defense, as he’s a little jumpy (although that, too, is advancing). He throws himself off-balance at times by trying for kick balls, a weird habit you can’t stop noticing once you see it (although anecdotally, I do think he’s been less prone to soccer of late; I wonder if coach Pop told him to cut it out): \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]  
  
And while I’m not sure this is actually a negative thing, Wemby is a big proponent of the Kornet Kontest. If I’m a Spurs fan, I’d prefer he holster any unnecessary jumping. Watch him swat an invisible fly at the top of this clip: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]  
  
(He’s not even in between the shooter and the basket! I giggle every time I watch this video. Then again, the shot didn’t go in…)  
  
Those are real knocks, if understandable, given his age. And if the season ended right now, Rudy Gobert would be the deserving Defensive Player of the Year — I’ve waxed rhapsodic about his resurgence several times since January last season. But the trendline of Wembanyama’s defensive performance looks like a lower-case “L,” and that’s not an exaggeration: \[[picture here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/should-victor-wembanyama-be-defensive)\]  
  
Further improvement is not guaranteed, of course. Teams are scheming to keep Wemby out of their plays, and the rookie wall is a real threat. [Allergies](https://twitter.com/HectorLedesmaTV/status/1754020788309508267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1754020788309508267%7Ctwgr%5E3e37ddbc756ef2146794dc72740403ac6e4bff15%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclutchpoints.com%2Fspurs-news-victor-wembanyama-not-immune-infamous-south-texas-allergies)might be his greatest threat. But there’s a solid chance that Wembanyama is the most deserving Defensive Player of the Year candidate by season’s end — and it might not be close.  
  
The question, then, is whether voters will give it to him. If he wins DPOY as a rookie, it will be hard not to give it to him for much of the next decade, barring injuries. Defensive Player of the Year is less prone to voting fatigue and contextual narratives than MVP. Dikembe Mutombo won it four times in seven years, Ben Wallace four times in five seasons, and Dwight Howard three-peated. More recently, Gobert won it three times in four years (and might add a fourth in seven this season). And Wembanyama won’t be worse at defense than he is right now.  
  
It’s impossible to predict what the league will look like in future seasons with any degree of certainty. And I don’t think voters will be willing to give DPOY to a rookie, no matter what the numbers say, particularly one toiling like a 7’4” Sisyphus on a basement-dwelling team. But I’m increasingly convinced that they should.

I think Wemby definitely has the impact but with his team still being not great on D when he is on, and struggling to pick up wins, I think it'll be hard to give him DPOY. 
There were mentions of Draymond as a dark horse DPOY candidate last year for similar reasons, whipping a poor defense into something serviceable when he took to the floor, but that narrative didn't get far. || [removed] || It’s a good analysis but isn’t the DPOY solidly in Gobert’s hands right now? If you want to make a case for Victor I’d like to see more direct comparison between the two in the write-up. 

Rudy is the defensive anchor of by far and away the leagues best defense. Teams take very few shots in the paint against the wolves and when they do they miss. ||

Positionless All-Defensive Teams will be a bloodbath this year; can't wait! || Great write up, entertaining, but don’t lean so hard into similes imo || I just want to say how incredible this post was, you really put a hell of a lot of research into this and you definitely have me convinced. || I think you make a lot of great points about his individual defense, and he is undeniably already a top defender in the league. However, he has a near zero percent chance of winning this year. The Spurs are far too bad defensively for anyone on the roster to be considered. They're currently 24 in defensive rating. The winner of DPOY almost always comes fro a top 3 defensive team. The team difference is just too large to overcome someone like Gobert who is also deserving and on the top defense in the NBA. || He’ll be a future winner but this year should definitely go to AD or Gobert. My preference is AD but Gobert will probably win it. Amazing read tho. || Wemby gonna single handedly extend Greg Pop's coaching career giving him a reason to stick around a few more years to oversee the growth of an amazing prospect.

Nice write up op ty || ""but team record! but team defensive ratings!""

great write-up, as usual - i saw your Darius Garland one a few months back and thought it was a fantastic analysis of his growth. (maybe need to see Donovan Mitchell at full time point guard more often, because during DG's injury he looked capital E ELITE.) as a spurs fan, watching his presence, his composed tendencies, his intimidation factor, and the ridiculous block radius... Dikembe and Wallace are tied for most DPOYs, with 4. I really think Wemby could get 5. makes me laugh whenever i think 'this is the worst he's going to be'. || Rudy is gonna have 4 but Wemby might top that.  Players do not go at him.  Him playing the top of the zone is one of the crazier things I’ve ever seen.  Sucks he’s in the west. || I personally want Anthony Davis to get it but I think gobert takes it. That being said I can see prime wemby getting 4 like Wallace and mutombo || Great read man. Really enjoyed it. Personally I have no issue giving the DPOY to a player on one of the worst Ds if they elevate the team in crazy levels when on the court. But voters likely will not be receptive unfortunately. I cannot imagine how good he will be in his prime on D. I can imagine a KG/Ben Wallace all-time impact. Chet will be overshadowed defensively compared to Wemby but he will be damn elite too I think. || It’s amazing that just as the scoring went berserk last year, we have so many top 10 picks in this year who are great defensive players. 

Wemby, Chet and Lively are all vital make or break players for their team defence. Ausar has unlimited potential defensively. 

On a tangent, I hope Simmons can get healthy/motivated and try to focus on playing a draymond green style defensive core/playmaker role in the future on a less insane contract. The guy at his peak was one of the best defensive players I’ve seen. He could switch and guard all positions with full intensity and was the only player I’ve seen who he roundly troubled Luka on pure 1v1 challenges (I’m a mavs fan). It’s very much a small hope though. || Good read, and I agree that Wemby is already an elite defensive player. Not sure he actually had a case though, not so long as Gobert has been eligible. He’s got it all but locked up already. || And he’s doing all this in under 30 mins a game. Mind blowing. He is exceeding expectations. True alien. || What do you think the chances are of him winning both ROY and DPOY? As far as I’m aware no rookie has won DPOY let alone both in the same season. || I dont think he wins it this year but he gonna have 5 or more dpoy by the end of his career 😭 || The argument that there's a huge difference between when he's on and off on a really bad team doesn't really work in his favor, as that what you'd expect for a guy which protects the paint. Blocks overall is really overrated, I think it's much better to just look at DFG% which is at least a decent metric for paint protectors. There he falls short of both Rudy & KP for example, which both contests more attempts per game and at an overall better clip. We should probably give Wemby some leeway in that regard though since he doesn't have the support of those two players, but I still don't think it makes for it enough to give him the DPOY, which is pretty much a lock for Rudy at this point I'd say. || ...in the future when/if Spurs start winning. DPOY, MVP, and similar awards should be correlated to team record. || The fact that San Antonio actually has about a league average defense with Wemby on the court this year should automatically give him consideration. They have sooo many awful defenders || Can’t give someone DPOY when the teams win percentage is 0.20. Individual stats are important but this is looking too close to the surface and not at the bigger picture. || Why don't we rename this award DTOY? (Defensive team of the year). 
As a french supporter of Wemby and Rudy I have a hard time understanding the ponderated criterias which lead to individual distinctions.
If we are talking about the player, we should take into consideration his influence on team results by comparing the stats when a player is on the flloor vs off floor.
If we want to name a DTOY, we take the team which allows the least number of points from the opponents.
Mixing individual and collection performance is very misleading. Which criteria?
What if Wemby goes for 5 blocks per game in coming years, 18 rebounds, 2 steals, allows let's say, his team to go from 30th in defensive ranking off floor to 2nd position when on the floor. And still not manage to go to the playoff? While meantime, Rudy influence decrease while the Wolves keep being the most efficient team defensively? 
Of course I'm pushing the exemple quite far but honestly it is quite confusing. || The anecdote about Branham putting his hands up and being upset at teammates when screened may indicate that Wemby didn't call out the screen.  In other words, while he has the physical tools to be better than anything we've seen, there's NBA-tier skills that he needs to learn to make his team's defense actually good. 

Also, Wemby's positive impact has to be taken with the note that the Spurs don't really have any good backup big men.  The Cavs went to work on Wemby & Co because there isn't a second rim protector on the roster. || If his defense doesn't actually have any real impact, then no. Gobert was literally the reason those Utah defenses were great, and when he got played off the court in the playoffs or didn't play in the regular season...the team defense cratered to what the Spurs look like with Wemby. || darn right he is... I think he deserves much more than Gobert, but the odds right now are -700 for Gobert and +1400 for Wemby... That's feel way off to me when you look at the numbers. || For the last 25 years, no one was DPOY and missed playoffs.
Spurs are on the bottom of conference. 
I think he has good chances to be all defensive,  but not dpoy || Not necessarily wins, but there is an overwhelming correlation with team defensive rating. You have to go back to 2011-12 to find a DPOY that wasn't on a top 3 defense, and he was still on a top 5 defense. Spurs are 24th. Wemby is not a realistic choice. || This. 

I am as biased as it gets: being a French Spurs fan.

And even though he’s already one of the best defenders in the league, has everything to go down as the greatest defender ever, and will probably be a favorite for DPOY every year he’s heathy for the next 15 years (might retire with the most awards in history), this year isn’t for him, because DPOY is usually given to the best defender of one of the best defensive teams…

It’s okay though. I’m not worried for him. We’ll probably get tired of him winning too many awards over the next 15 years so… grab them before it’s too late.

Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-02-07,nbadiscussion,1am9djz,Did this deadline signal a bubble bursting in trade market?,"I could TOTALLY be reading too much into this and it's just a one-off deadline, but what was this deadline defined by? The non-movement of players, specifically Mitchell, Murray, Smart, Brogdon, and DeRozan. What all of those players have in common is that all of them were decently recently acquired by their current teams for pretty exorbitant prices by the standard of 5 years ago. Mitchell and Murray each went for 3+ firsts, Smart went for 2 firsts, DeRozan was a first and 2 seconds for the right to give a big deal, Brogdon is currently the best player Portland got back for Dame.   


It seems to me all of these teams decided they COULD NOT sell at a loss. That even if it's clear that Murray is not fitting on this team, if they get back less than what they paid then they will have wasted 2 seasons AND asset(s).   


So you look at what the Knicks were able to do this deadline, bringing in 3 playoff rotation pieces for a total of 0 first round picks.

You look at how LAL and PHX weren't able to help themselves at all because of how leveraged they are.

However… it just so happens that those teams are also competing at high levels so they ain’t in no rush to limit their flexibility until they love the move they’re making.

They're the hottest team in the league, finally healthy, and the 2 seed. Mitchell has given no indication that he wants out and has been a great leader, teammate, and locker room presence. I would have been *astonished* if they had moved him. It really has nothing to do with the trade market.  || I hope that your right. 

If not a bubble bursting it's at least a stall in prices. || Well to knock out 3 of them quickly 
1) Mitchell isn’t going to move, he’s the 2 seed in the east and all the trade rumours about him have been speculation, Cavs have no incentive to move him 

2)Derozan wasn’t going to move because Chicago is incompetent, they probably want to get off his money this off season anyway 

3) Grizzlies just acquired Smart and have been unhealthy so I guess they want to keep him to have a proper run at it next year 

That said, it’s a head scratcher that Portland didn’t move Brogdon and it seems as though DJMs value has tanked. 

I think there are still star players that can move for a large amount of firsts but teams are starting to see what’s happened to Brooklyn and Clippers, and seeing it may not be the best strategy. I also think there’s less stars now that would command such a slew of frps. Maybe Doncic, SGA, Giannis. Outside of that there aren’t many players that would command more than 3 first rounders.

So I don’t think the market is going to burst to the extent that star players are being traded for 1 or 2 picks like in the 90s but it’s definitely going to calm down || Why is Mitchell included at the top? Just why? The Cavs are on an 8 game win streak are 15-1 in the last 16 games and are the two seed. 

Yet he’s a trade candidate at this deadline? The media has really brainwashed people || Your point isn’t off but I don’t think you can lump the Blazers in with the others in overpaying for Brogdon, the best player we got for Lillard was Jrue, the best player we got for Jrue was Brogdon, and a handful of picks in the process. Hell, best player we ended with in the trade was probably Ayton. 

We all expected him to be moved at deadline, but seeing how the other trades went we were probably only getting a handful of seconds, when we were expecting 1+ firsts. Not that long ago we got a first for Hart at the deadline, and we were expecting Brogdon to be worth more. As such, Blazer fandom ok with holding him. || The new CBA is much more restrictive than before. Look at the top teams competing for a title who now can’t add players bought out by their previous team. The league is changing and hopefully becoming a bit fairer. There will be unintended consequences.

Pascal and OG were moved earlier than trade deadline week. Neither of them had a first round pick attached to them. Second round picks is the currency. 

The new CBA makes first round picks much more valuable. We saw it in the 2023 draft, hardly any trades or movement up and down the draft order compared to previous years. || Anyone with half a brain knew Mitchell wasn't going anywhere. That's just the NYC/LA media stirring shit up because God forbid a good player play for a small market team. || Worth noting;

Several major buyers are basically out of capital (Suns/Lakers). Others are waiting for a needle mover (Knicks/Thunder) while some are knocked out by Injuries (76ers). 

Factor in the new salary cap structure and bad draft class. Boom. Low volume trade deadline. || I think your premise is wrong. There were a normal number of significant players traded (or more, even). It just wasn't all at the deadline.

* Harden
* Siakam (and Bruce Brown)
* OG and the other rotation guys in that deal
* Rozier
* Bogdan, Grimes, etc.
* Hield
* PJ Washington
* Tillman
* PatBev/Payne
* Royce O'Neale
* Monte Morris
* Hayward
* Olynyk
* Gafford
* The weird Nets-Toronto trade

And those are just player-based trades. There were also a bunch of significant moves made only around tax and draft goals.

Murray didn't get traded because Atlanta thinks they can get more in the offseason and they aren't going to contend this year anyway.   

DeRozan didn't get traded because the Bulls are still trying to make the playoffs for some reason.  

Mitchell didn't get traded because Cleveland is good. 

Brogdon probably didn't have first round value to contenders because of his injury proneness and Portland may prefer his leadership over two second round picks. 

I never saw any Smart rumors. I think Memphis is committed to him. || >Tradable assets are very concentrated within a few teams, namely Thunder, and Jazz.

That's an hyperbole. Spurs, Rockets, Pelicans, Knicks, Celtics,  Magic, Grizzlies, Pacers, and Nets all have a decent amount of tradable assets, not too far off the Thunder and especially the Jazz || Could you (or anyone) elaborate on what phoenix did, I am not exactly familiar with their move to create seconds and am curious what you mean by leveraging rights to those same pick swaps again. || Yea I'll admit the Brogdon one was a healthy stretch, but my logic was the Blazers essentially traded the Dame era for the Scoot era right? I am not off Scoot by any means I still have high hopes, but so far it hasn't been good. Rob is out for the year, Ayton has also been disappointing especially given the contract and Brogdon (who obviously is the remnants from the Dame/Jrue overall move) is the non scoot player with the most trade value. If they sold him and only got say a late first, a former non lottery pick and a salary then you'd look at the dame trade and see just Scoot, Ayton, Rob and late picks, they kinda need Brogdon to turn into something a little less flat.   


But I agree I'm stretching all of that some || They went to Memphis and wizards (if not more) and said you can have the rights to say (not exact pick just examples) the better 2029 1st between us and you. All it’ll cost is a future 2nd. They did that multiple times with the same pick(s).

So the suns end up with the worst first between them and multiple other teams, but gain 2nd round picks, and still end up with a 1st || That’s interesting, so the suns basically went to another team and said we may not have our pick, but whatever pick we have if it’s better than yours you can also take it… very interesting || It’s like that but if suns pick is a better position than the other teams then the teams swap picks, so either way suns end up with a first round pick, just lower down in the draft than both Memphis and wizards. 

In a simplified big picture way: Memphis and Washington paid the suns second round picks to gain/guarantee a better draft position with their first round picks. || heres the long version

\- you arent allowed to trade away first round picks on consecutive years, and you can only trade picks up to 7 years in advance

\- phoenix traded all 4 of its available first rounders last year for durant (2023, 2025, 2027, 2029)

\- in the bradley beal trade, they therefore didnt have first rounders to give the wizards outright. instead, they gave the wizards pick swaps in 2024, 2026, 2028, and 2030. so basically, in each of those years, the wizards will get the more advantageous of either their own pick, or the suns pick. the suns then get the worse of those first rounders. (we can pretty safely assume that in 2024 and probably 2026, the wizards pick would be the better one anyway, so the swaps would be meaningless. )

\- so phoenix has not only traded away their firsts in the odd number years, but they have (theoretically) degraded the value of their first rounders in even number years. they then went to memphis/orlando and further degraded them

\- they told memphis, for example: hey, in 2030, we will have the worse of the 2 first rounders between us and the wizards. we will offer to swap THAT pick (the worse one), with yours. so hypothetically, its the year 2030. the wizards are a solid team and are assigned the #20 pick. the suns are in the lottery and wind up with the #10 pick. and memphis has the #25 pick. so it plays out like this:

\- first, the suns/wizards swap plays out. the wizards take that #10 pick from the suns, and the suns move all the way back to the #20 pick the wizards were assigned. then you adjudicate the grizzlies/suns swap. the grizzlies get the worse of the suns/wizards pick (here, #20). and the suns now get the worst of all 3 teams (here, #25).

\- so the value of the swap to memphis isnt that great, because they are only moving ""up"" to the worse of 2 other picks. and if memphis already had a better pick than EITHER phoenix or washington, then they get nothing from the swap. even if they do get a swap, the odds that the WORSE of the suns/wizards pick is a great pick is slim. memphis was willing to part with 2nd round picks for that degraded swap.

\- phoenix did this with i believe 3 of the first round swaps it gave washington. || That is quite interesting, talk about leveraging your future… || the funny thing is the swaps might not mean anything at all. like if phoenix is the best team of the 3, they'd have the worst pick anyway, regardless of swaps. certainly in 2024 it wont matter at all || Do we really think Phoenix will be good in 2029? Durant will have retired by then. If Beal isn’t retired he’ll be a shell of himself. So really Phoenix is deciding to hold onto Devin Booker and to use eventual cap space to sign a 75% of max player to a max contract. That’s a recipe for the treadmill. || Thing is players from around the league have shown they want to play with book and will demand trades to get it- cp3, kd, book and then min contract vet values like Eric Gordon

James jones isn’t the type of gm to build through young players he values vets and the owner has shown he’ll go well above the luxury tax threshold || We don’t know. They probably won’t be great but will still have an effective Booker. But i also don’t trust the wizards to be better."

The non-movement of players, specifically Mitchell, Murray, Smart, Brogdon, and DeRozan. What all of those players have in common is that all of them were decently recently acquired by their current teams for pretty exorbitant prices by the standard of 5 years ago. Mitchell and Murray each went for 3+ firsts, Smart went for 2 firsts, DeRozan was a first and 2 seconds for the right to give a big deal, Brogdon is currently the best player Portland got back for Dame.   


It seems to me all of these teams decided they COULD NOT sell at a loss. That even if it's clear that Murray is not fitting on this team, if they get back less than what they paid then they will have wasted 2 seasons AND asset(s).

Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-02-27,nbadiscussion,1b1f19c,Evan Mobley and the quiet agony of small improvements [OC Analysis],"There has been so much handwringing about Evan Mobley and his failure to develop a three-point shot. The Cleveland Cavaliers had massive success for nearly two months by surrounding Donovan Mitchell and Jarrett Allen with shooters; while the team has consistently won since Mobley’s return, most of the talk about the Cavs centers around the broken-jigsaw fit of having two non-shooting bigs in the starting lineup. It’s a fair conversation to have, but it also doesn’t paint the whole picture.  
  
First, let us address the trumpeting elephant in the room: No, Mobley has not miraculously turned into a sniper since his return from injury. After arthroscopic knee surgery to remove loose bodies in his knee, Mobley spent much of the time he missed talking about — and practicing — three-pointers. It hasn’t mattered.  
  
Mobley is still reluctant to let it fly from behind the arc. I hand-tracked his triples this season (that’s not an “eat the tape” humblebrag; it took about three seconds). Mobley has only attempted 25 triples all season. 15 of those have come in the 12 games since Jan 29th, when Mobley returned from injury. So that’s an improvement, and he is technically 40% from deep! But 1.25 attempts per game does not change how defenses treat him, and it’s merely in line with his averages before this season.  
  
*\[Hello, everyone! Thanks for reading. As always, I've collected a bunch of illustrative video clips for this post.* [*You can view them in-context here*](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/evan-mobley-and-the-quiet-agony-of)*\]*  
  
Out of his 15 misfires, one was blocked, and one was a heave. Out of the remaining 13, nine were short. He seldom misses long, right, or left. Consistently missing short can be a product of nerves as much as poor shot biomechanics.  
  
It’s a lizard-or-the-egg thing: Mobley doesn’t make many threes because he isn’t confident, but because he’s not confident, he doesn’t make many. It’s a vicious ouroboros. And as national discourse will let you know, this is a capital-P Problem when the team also starts a former All-Star at center in Jarrett Allen.  
  
The Problem, laid out: Allen and Mobley are fantastic defensive players with real offensive skills, but the Cavs simply have trouble scoring when they share the court. [Their 112.6 points per 100 possessions is in the 30th percentile](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/6/lineups?on=4337&on=4866#tab-four_factors) for all lineups.  
  
Interestingly, the team actually has a slightly worse offense when Mobley is the lone big (and gets outscored overall); meanwhile, when Allen is the center without Mobley on the court, the team scores a strong 120.3 points per 100 and blitzes teams by a substantial margin.  
  
But the “Mobley = less spacing = less scoring” talk oversimplifies things. Most obviously, Allen/Mobley lineups get it back on the other end. [Those lineups only allow 108 points per 100](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/6/lineups?on=4866&on=4337#tab-four_factors), 95th percentile for all lineups. That number stays true with Mitchell and Garland sharing the court, too.  
  
For the season, lineups with all four of Mobley, Allen, Mitchell, and Garland have performed well, [scoring at a median rate](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/6/lineups?on=4866&on=4337&on=4362&on=4576#tab-four_factors) (yes, really) while locking teams down defensively. Those groups are winning their minutes by a comfortable, though not monstrous, margin. And the numbers are better since Mobley’s return on Jan 29th. As a team, the Cavs are eighth in offense and third in defense since then, even as Mobley and guard Darius Garland work their way back from injury.  
  
Sure, the schedule has been bounce-house soft. But that stretch also included a win over the Clippers and a blowout of the Kings. The Cavs are 10-3 since Mobley’s return; two of those losses occurred when Donovan Mitchell, the team’s best player, was out sick, and the remaining loss was by two points.  
  
So yes, Mobley’s offensive fit isn’t perfect next to Allen. But that doesn’t mean it can’t work, and to be honest, I’m not particularly interested in what they should do in the offseason just yet. The Cavs are here now, and they’re good. They’re second in the East! Mobley remains a big part of that, even if his injury has prevented him from showing his peak form.  
  
The shot is one — very important! — thing, but Mobley has made a number of improvements to other parts of his game this season while battling the knee injury (and recovery process). The quiet things matter, too.  
  
His already impressive defense has only gotten better. He demolishes foes one-on-one: [opponents score just 0.64 points per possession](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/players/615d0923e771e94fc00a6ba2/playtypes?seasonId=651b131d1507a2202c01094c&offense=false) against him on an island, even better than last year’s excellent showing. It’s almost the exact same number when ballhandlers attempt to test him in the pick-and-roll this season, again among the league’s best and a far better mark than last year’s .92 points per possession.  
  
Mobley has become a master of verticality. He’s a quick jumper who blocks a shocking number of floaters, a shot specifically designed to get over the heads of defenders like Mobley before they can react: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/evan-mobley-and-the-quiet-agony-of)\]  
  
He’s now one of the league’s best big-man close-out artists. He scuttles rapidly to the shooter like a tap-dancing crustacean, hands out but perfectly balanced. His length allows him to contest shooters (or at least face-guard) without having to leave his feet, allowing him to bottle up foolish attempts to attack: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/evan-mobley-and-the-quiet-agony-of)\]  
  
There have also been offensive improvements, even if they’re not the ones people want. In the playoffs last year, Mobley struggled in space against the New York Knicks. He’d get the ball on the short roll, and you could see the wheels turning in his head as he froze. The offense seemingly ground to a halt whenever he touched the rock.  
  
This year, Mobley's become a more decisive passer. He’s averaging a career-high 3.2 assists per 36 minutes, which would be higher if the team’s offense didn’t have two ball-dominant guards (and fifth starter Max Strus and Allen are sneaky-good passers, too). There is future post-hub potential with Mobley. He’s more creative with his angles: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/evan-mobley-and-the-quiet-agony-of)\]  
  
He can even run the occasional big-big pick-and-roll. This is catnip for basketball nerds (\*bats at highlight, sneezes, falls asleep\*):  
  
\[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/evan-mobley-and-the-quiet-agony-of)\]  
  
When Mobley decides to attack (and yes, he should attack more), he’s not settling for half-hooks as often. [A significant portion of his diet has shifted from floater range to right at the rack](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4866#tab-shooting_accuracy), boosting his shot profile. That holds even when he’s playing next to Allen. He’s putting a crowbar into the defense’s cracks and forcing just enough space for spinny finger-rolls and Stretch Armstrong dunks.  
  
Mobley’s best offensive skill has become cutting, and he’s developed fantastic timing with Garland and Strus, especially: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/evan-mobley-and-the-quiet-agony-of)\]  
  
Mobley’s rebounding has upgraded, too, and this isn’t simply a result of him playing more center (although that is the reason for his slight uptick in fouls). Weirdly, he actually [has a higher rebounding rate as a power forward](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4866/positions#tab-defense_rebounding).  
  
For what it’s worth, his free throw percentage has improved each year and currently sits at 73%, which could matter at the end of games.  
  
In other words, Mobley is getting better. We all agree that Mobley would be significantly improved with a three-point shot. A more aggressive mindset would be welcome, too. Both would fix a lot of what ails Cleveland. But that shot ain’t coming this season, so the team needs to ensure that they put themselves in the best position to succeed with what they have. Mobley is polishing other aspects of his game to help.  
  
The conversation reminds me of the talk around Bam Adebayo, whose subtle improvements over the years never seem to satisfy a fanbase constantly bleating for more, more, more. And to some extent, I get it. When a player’s ceiling is as high as Mobley’s, and the way to reach it is so obvious, how couldn’t fans get frustrated?  
  
But real-life basketball players aren’t 2K simulacrums. You can’t spend real money to change a player’s DNA (although teams certainly try!). Mobley will likely earn a max rookie extension this summer, and he has limitless potential, particularly at center, surrounded by shooters. But evidence suggests he’s also not as good a center as Jarrett Allen right now; for the short term, the Cavs will continue staggering them as much as possible, hoping the defensive dominance when they do share the court outweighs any offensive sludginess. It’s not a perfect solution, but basketball doesn’t hand out too many of those. The Cavs are making lemonade out of some pretty good lemons.  
  
There are still a few cards to play in the playoffs, too. Max Strus has almost always been the fifth wheel for the core four. Can we see some Dean Wade there, perhaps? Wade is bigger and stronger than Strus and likely a better positional defender (although Strus is feisty). He doesn’t have the quick trigger Strus does, but he is a more accurate shooter. It would be an interesting playoff wrinkle to run out bigger lineups that theoretically don’t sacrifice much shooting. Georges Niang in that spot creates a similar look, although Wade is the better player.  
  
Between Strus, Wade, Niang, defensive ace Isaac Okoro, Caris LeVert, and the emergence of super-shooter Sam Merrill, the Cavs aren’t limited to one or two role-player permutations. They can put out enough trees to fill a forest, opt to field four shooters, or go for a tenacious defensive lineup. We might even see Mobley, Allen, or Garland sit minutes in crunch time if the team gets desperate. Coach J.B. Bickerstaff will have to figure out how best to utilize the tools at his disposal (something he’s struggled with at times), but he’s got a full workbench to play with, at least.  
  
The playoffs expose all. Last year, it showed that Mobley and the Cavs were too limited. This year’s team is deeper; more importantly, this year’s Mobley is even better. Whether the subtle improvements on the margins are enough to propel Cleveland deep into the spring will be a source of agony to Cavs fans until then.",141,18,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1b1f19c/evan_mobley_and_the_quiet_agony_of_small/,2024-02-27 10:47:43,"Hi everyone, thanks for reading!  
  
I've got a bunch of illustrative video clips for this article here: https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/evan-mobley-and-the-quiet-agony-of  
  
I am pumped for this year's playoffs, but for Cleveland especially, it feels like a prove-it year for the concept of this team. Can't wait to see what happens. || Great write-up — you’ve put words to things I’ve noticed subconsciously but hadn’t articulated. Particularly the point about him being more aggressive when going to the rim on offense, that has been one of my favorite improvements. With a little more strength, he’s going to be unstoppable near the bucket soon. 

I also took note of the isolation defense numbers. I was somewhat floored to hear Tim Bontemps say on Zach Lowe’s podcast a few weeks ago that he has always thought Mobley was overrated on D, so it’s nice to have some numbers to cite to show that no he actually very much is among the best in the league. || Never in my life have I signed up for a mailing list and actually enjoyed reading what then comes in, but your mailers have changed that. Really enjoy your content.

Mobley is one of my favorite young players and every time I go ""why hasn't he figured it out yet?"" I remind myself that he's *22 years old.* I like your Bam comparison - we, as fans, are insatiable.

I still feel like this Cavs team is missing something, and I don't know what it is. Hopefully Spida stays and they can figure things out since they're quite a young starting crew. || This is a great write-up and I agree with your analysis here. I do think that there is another reason why fans are so fixated on seeing large improvements from Mobley is because of the comparison between him and his peers. Seeing Scottie emerge as a real all-star level player and seeing the harder to notice improvements from Mobley is making people impatient in their expectations for him after being so close in their ROY race. It really is important to realize how non-linear development can be and is, and that even if Mobley never develops that 3 point shot, there is still tons of development that he could add to his game to make the Cavs a better team. || The improved passing is good to see. If he can average 3-4 assists per game just making simple reads, it should really help with the lack of shooting || Great piece. I really like your takeaways. If Mobley continues to be aggressive with cuts and putting the ball on the floor from the wings, I think his shooting woes are not an insurmountable obstacle for the Cavs || The only thing wrong with Mobley is that he's not even close to as good as Jarrett Allen and it works better in most situations not to play two guys like that together.  Lots of teams would be happy to have a guy like him as their center. || So you know what's funny? I actually think he WAS overrated on defense -- last year. There's no universe where he should've been receiving DPOY votes, despite what the voting ballot said. A lot of the conversations around young stars tends to conflate what they *will* become with what they *are.*

But this year, I think he's been significantly, noticeably better even as the conversation around him worsens.

Basically, everything is a product of the public's expectations and whether a player is falling short, meeting, or exceeding these preconceived notions lol.

Thanks for reading! || Wow, thanks! If it's cool with you, I might borrow that as a quote for my site on the sign-up page ha. Appreciate you!

And yeah, the playoffs will reveal all. But for a 22-year-old, I think Mobley is doing alright! || I second this! Your articles are always insightful and entertaining and I love your writing style (I’ve seen people criticize you for “trying too hard” or coming across as corny with all the metaphors but don’t listen to the haters!!! Having your own style and writing voice is what sets you apart and if Kendrick Perkins can get paid millions to pass half baked southern colloquialisms as basketball commentary on TV, you are more than allowed to use some cheeky metaphors in a serious analysis)! Keep writing, I’ll keep reading!! || I haven't really heard the Bam Adebayo comparison before -- but it almost makes too much sense. Masters at verticality and protecting the rim without huge block numbers, a non-threat from beyond the arc as a shooter but uses that non-threat to act as a hub for actual threats (Mobley has the IQ to be a Top-5 DHO hub) and they're both arguably the best bigs at defending the perimeter || Great point. || Yr making good points.

The common parlance is ""big men take time to develop"". I'm totally fine with Mobley's rate of development at this point.

Not so much a big man issue, but the blogs that I am part of were tearing their hair out about Okoro's development this time last season. Such an athlete, defender...why can't he score consistently?? Look at him now. I now pray the Cavs can afford to keep him! || Thanks! Yeah, we'll see how it holds up in the playoffs, but I'm guardedly optimistic. || I think his DPOY votes came from the results of Cleveland's no.1-ranked defense for the majority of the season despite playing 2 questionable defenders 35 minutes a game, where he's pretty easily the best defender on that team (Although Jarrett Allen is pretty damn underrated). 

I'm sure you watched a lot of Cavs games to write this article, and as someone who hasn't really tuned into their games, how has Garland been? He's slumping statistically -- shooting 33% from 3, and has dropped in Pts/100, Ast/100 and FTA/100 by quite a bit. || Mobley led the league in defensive win shares.  And we know it's not a good metric, but it is a metric.  And if you don't actually spend time watching a team, all you have are highlights and metrics, and Mobley's had some decent highlights too.  The number of people who watch enough basketball to properly rate every starter properly is embarrassingly small.  The number of people who watch enough basketball and also know what they're looking at is smaller. 

You also have metrics like number of shot contests, where Mobley finished at or near the top of both 3-pointer contests and rim contests.  Again, stats don't tell the whole story.  But it was an impressive stat. 

You also have to realize he was fighting regression to the mean statistically for most of the year as there was a large amount of 3-point shooting luck on his contests. 

And then the Cleveland fan base saw Mobley start taking over a few games defensively early in fourth quarters. This launched a narrative wave landed at precisely the right time for awards season.

The secret, though, is that all of Garland, Mitchell, Okoro, and LeVert played defense better than people assumed they were playing it, whether it's because of profile (""two short guards""), event stats (""Okoro can't be an elite defender with those steal and block numbers""), or reputation (""Mitchell was horrible in Utah and LeVert has never been a good defender"").  A lot of the credit there goes to the coaching staff for the buy-in from the whole team. || Of course || Good and insightful comment, particularly agree with the first and last paragraphs. I’m a big believer that NOBODY has the full answer defensively, so the timing of some influential voices deciding to write nice things about Mobley was a big factor. 

Thanks for the comment!"

#Jaylen Brown

**Case FOR:** Jaylen's putting up good numbers on an amazing team (23/6/4 on +0.2rTS% with good defense; 26th in DPM/ 34th in EPM/ 51st in LEBRON). Boston lapping the league in team record and net rating means they'll likely get 2 All-NBA candidates and Brown's probably the 2nd biggest contributor to that plus he's likely more familiar to voters vs KP/White (Porzingis is already ineligible regardless because of games played). 

**Case AGAINST:** Boston's stacked top 6. Boston have a ludicrous +16.0 net rating with Jaylen OFF the court, which almost doesn't make any sense.

---

#Paul George

**Case FOR**: Top 15ish player, with good numbers and great defense as the clear 2nd best player on a contender (22/5/4 on +2.0rTS%; 9th in DPM/ 10th in EPM/ 27th in LEBRON).

**Case AGAINST:** His scoring game has been slightly lower volume/ less consistent than his contemporaries, which means voters may not have realised what an impactful overall season he's been having.

---

#Tyrese Haliburton

**Case FOR:** Top 10-15 player when fully healthy, great numbers on a good team (21/4/11 on +2.8rTS%; 36th in DPM/ 9th in EPM/ 7th in LEBRON). 

**Case AGAINST:** Has clearly declined since returning from injury (16/4/10 on 56TS% vs 24/4/13 on 63TS% pre-injury) and in his reduced state, the fit with new post-trade-deadline co-star Pascal Siakam has been uneven (Indiana have had a -3.3 net rating when they've shared the floor thus far). His first 33 games were amazing enough that I think he still may make it if he hits the games played requirement (he can only miss 1-2 more games IIRC).

---

#De'Aaron Fox

**Case FOR:** Top 2 player on a good team putting up decent numbers (27/4/6 on -1.1rTS%; 28th in DPM/ 20th in EPM/ 28th in LEBRON). Lineup data hints that the Kings' success may correlate more heavily with Fox's presence than Sabonis' despite Fox's relative inefficiency/inconsistency (Kings' net rating with Fox plus Sabonis = +3.9, Fox minus Sabonis = +0.2 net rating, Sabonis minus Fox = -5.5 net rating).

**Case AGAINST:** Inconsistent and inefficient scoring/'effort' the past few months have tanked his narrative juice, resulting in most of the credit for the Kings' record to be transferred to his consistent, efficient, triple-double aficionado teammate Domantas Sabonis. Kings are also flirting with the play-in, so questions might arise if they necessarily ""deserve"" 2 All-NBA players.


---

~~#Jamal Murray~~ (eliminated from All-NBA contention - games played)

~~**Case FOR**: Likely a top 20 player when taking playoffs into account. 2nd best player on a top 2 seed, putting up decent numbers (21/4/7 on +0.0rTS%; 24th in DPM/ 41st in EPM/ 56th in LEBRON). Jamal-plus-Jokic lineups are some of the best in the league (+14.5 net rating), while Jokic-minus-Jamal lineups are still great but not invincible (+7.5).~~

~~**Case AGAINST**: Inconsistent offensive output, plus lower scoring volume on average than some of his competitors. Jamal-minus-Jokic lineups have a -13.4 net rating.~~

---

#Zion Williamson

**Case FOR**: Top 2 player on a top 5 seed, putting up decent numbers (23/6/5 on +3.6rTS%; 74th in DPM/ 59th in EPM/ 169th in LEBRON) with improved defense. Has been ramping up lately too - 31/7/4 on 68TS% his last 3 games. Pels have a +2.0 net rating with Zion on the court and +1.3 with Zion minus Ingram. 

**Case AGAINST**: Pels have a +8.4 net rating with Zion off the court. Hasn't really had the narrative juice in his favour this season (wasn't voted as an All-Star) though a strong finish to the season could quickly change that.

---

#Tyrese Maxey

**Case FOR:** 2nd best player on a team which is a contender when fully healthy, putting up decent numbers (26/4/6 on -0.5rTS%; 59th in DPM/ 33rd in EPM/ 19th in LEBRON). Maxey-plus-Embiid lineups have been fantastic (+10.3 net rating), Embiid-minus-Maxey lineups have been good but not elite (+2.3 net rating), Maxey-minus-Embiid lineups are roughly neutral (-1.1 net rating), impressive given their injuries. Maxey's scoring actually [explodes](https://np.reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/1bf9alv/sixers_players_stats_with_and_without_joel_embiid/) without Embiid on the court - 20.5 -> 29.5 points per 75 on roughly similar efficiency. 

**Case AGAINST:** The Sixers are ""only"" the 8th seed atm  and have gone 10-22 without Embiid. Although, as a Sixers fan I can attest that Maxey's by far the biggest reason most of these games have been even somewhat competitive -- the team's constantly missing important players for various reasons (especially starter Melton who has been out for months), 2 other starters Tobias/Batum have turned into pumpkins without Embiid, starter-by-necessity Oubre has been solid but inefficient without Embiid, our main big man in JoJo's absence ""Bball"" Paul Reed has been mostly good but sometimes overtasked playing heavy minutes, Mo Bamba probably shouldn't be playing in the NBA, new acquisitions Buddy/ Lowry/ Payne have been decent but nothing special, etc..

---

#Victor Wembanyama

**Case FOR:** Probably already a top 20 player as a rookie, DPOY candidate, putting up strong numbers on a horrible team (21/10/3 with 1.3stl/3.4blks on -1.6rTS%; 8th in DPM/ 23rd in EPM/ 29th in LEBRON). Spurs are only regular-bad (-4.5 net rating) with Victor on the court - sporting an actually robust 71st percentile defense - while they're historically bad (-11.1 net rating) when Victor sits.

**Case AGAINST:** Plays on a horrible team. Took a while to get going, relatively weak first half of the season paired with a monster 2nd half. Voters may apply the rookie tax to him, whether unfairly or not.

---

#Bam Adebayo

**Case FOR:** Top 20ish player, top 2 player on a solid team, likely DPOY candidate, decent numbers (20/10/4 with 1.1stl/1.0blks on -1.6rTS%; 56th in DPM/ 70th in EPM/ 40th in LEBRON).

**Case AGAINST:** Most inefficient season of his career. Miami are roughly neutral (-0.4 net rating) when he's on the floor and plain bad (-3.9) when he's on the floor without Jimmy.

---

#Paolo Banchero

**Case FOR:** Best player on a top 5 seed putting up decent numbers (23/7/5 on -3.1rTS%; 154th in DPM/ 109th in EPM/ 75th in LEBRON). Magic are about neutral with Paolo on the court (-0.5 net rating) which is honestly impressive given how many injuries and rotating supporting cast members they've had.

**Case AGAINST:** The least efficient among the players in this group, and probably a level below as a passer compared to some of his fellow offensive centerpieces. Magic have a +7.5 net rating in almost 2000 possessions with Paolo off the court.

---

#Rudy Gobert

**Case FOR:** DPOY favourite, easily the best defender on by far the best defense in the league and arguably the 2nd most important player on a top 3 seed in the West, limited but useful offensive contributions (14/13/1 w 2.1 blks on +8.6rTS%; 23rd in DPM/ 42nd in EPM/ 23rd in LEBRON). 2nd highest on/off on the team among high minutes players (+5.3) after Ant (+9.4). Wolves are amazing when Ant and Gobert share the court without KAT (+14.0); they  tread water when Gobert is on the floor without Ant/KAT (-1.5 net rating) so he's still been capable of floor-raising to some degree.

**Case AGAINST:** Scoring game has regressed slightly from his Jazz days - likely only an average or slightly above/below average offensive player nowadays. Wolves have also been crushing opponents on both ends when Ant and KAT share the floor without Rudy (+14.9 net rating), though some of that is likely against bench units.",111,42,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1bgfg92/fringeey_allnba_candidates_cases_for_and_against/,2024-03-16 16:35:05,"I think it’ll be really hard to deny Boston two all NBA players, and I think there has been a national media wide recognition of how good Jaylen Brown has been recently. I would be surprised if he didn’t make it again. || Is George obviously the 2nd best player on the Clipperrs? Harden is currently ahead of him on win shares and PER - clearly a bettter defender, but I don't know that its so clear cut overall. || I think Zion and Sabonis deserve to make it but won’t because the voters will ignore team ranking to reward Steph, Lebron and AD for ‘living up to the challenge’ and playing 65 games this season after half a decade of not doing it and still (except AD) making All-NBA. || What puts Booker in the first group ? He has missed a ton of games, and is the #2 on a playin team.  || If Wemby continues to ramp it up towards the end of the season then fuck it, he's in for me. All-NBA is an individual award and he has been amazing. The fact that the Spurs aren't by far the worst team in the league is solely down to him. His lineups with Tre Jones are actually really strong as well, and the firts half of the season was clearly tanked by Point Jezza. || I think if you're looking at fringe candidates, Jarrett Allen deserves a mention:

Top ten in rebounds per game, win shares, offensive and defensive rating, and true shooting percentage; a central player on a top three team; top 25 in PER and blocks per game; 28th in VORP.

Currently 32nd in LeBron, 20th among frontcourt players (players listed ahead of him include Embiid, Kevin Love, and Johnathon Isaac)

Considering how many frontcourt players will be ineligible as a result of the 65 min. rule, I'd say he's a fringe candidate.

Edit: added LEBRON data || I think PG needs to get in

Brown will probably get in as the 2nd Boston player, and it makes sense given that Porzingis missed out because of games, otherwise it would be a tough choice.

Haliburton has had impressive first part of the season, and the only thing that has fallen off has been his 3-pt shooting since coming back from the injury. If he doesn't miss more games he could get in. || Paolo all-nba would be a pretty bad pick. He'd be a charity case because the Magic are okay in a terrible conference and he's not the best player on the team. The Magic would probably be fighting with the Lakers and Warriors for the 9/10 spot in the West || > Reminder: All-NBA teams are positionless now 

By rule yes and many voters will follow that but a bunch might not and so that may weaken the case for the fringe guards since you already have 6. 

You also didn't mention these guys but they are in my weighted boxscore so for completeness:

Alperen Sengun (63 GP but there's a special case for season ending injuries)    
Chet Holmgren  
Jarret Allen  
Damian Lillard  
Pascal Siakam || Jaylen Brown needs to be included before LBJ and AD are even considered. Also, there is no way Brown should be left off if you argue that both LBJ and AD should be All NBA, because there is no wrold where it amkes sense to have 2 players from the #10 team in the West ahead of 2 players from ther team with the best record in the NBA, by a mile. || Booker out. Brown in.

Halliburton in if he's not hurt.

Bam or Paolo third. || JB has +16 when he is off the floor because the Celtics entire team is centered around Tatum. He is the engine, and the Celtics tend to stagger Tatum and brown, so he doesn’t get to have a lot of Tatum minutes except for the beginning and end of games. 

Team plays way better when Tatum is out there. Haven’t checked the numbers but that’s the eye test. Team just well oiled when Tatum on the court. He has so much gravity and makes it so easy for the other guys. || For sure, he's peaking at the right time too, 29/6/4 on 62ts% his last 10 games so he's gonna be on voters' minds || Brown deserves it if he keeps this up. An elite two-way player. || Perfectly fair opinion, Harden's been really good... win shares and PER are just pretty bad advanced stats, as you can see here they rank near the very bottom in this list here showing what NBA executives/analytics staff think about publicly-available advanced stats:  https://hoopshype.com/lists/advanced-stats-nba-real-plus-minus-rapm-win-shares-analytics/

[DPM](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/DARKO/)/ [EPM](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm)/ [LEBRON](https://www.bball-index.com/lebron-database/) on the other hand rank 1st-3rd on the same list so I'll use them and try and give Harden the same treatment I gave the other guys...

---

**Case FOR:** 

- good numbers as the 2.5th option on a contender (17/5/8 on +5.1rTS%; 12th in DPM/ 26th on EPM/ 9th in LEBRON --- similar impact metrics to PG!). 

- LINEUP data: The Clippers are crushing opponents when their big 3 share the court (+11.2 net rating). In terms of 2-man lineups, Harden+PG lineups sans Kawhi still manage an awesome +10.7 net rating;  Harden-lone-star lineups are managing to somewhat tread water which is encouraging (-2.9 net rating, with an incredible 95th percentile offense though a 2nd percentile defense).

**Case AGAINST:** 

- strong costars/depth, so his offensive load is clearly lower than his previous seasons with the Sixers/Nets/Rockets


- LINEUP data: Kawhi-plus-PG-minus-Harden lineups have a ridiculous +19.8 net rating; while Harden+Kawhi lineups without PG are very average (-0.8 net rating); Clips are still somewhat good (+1.6) in Harden-less minutes overall. 

- He's still a negative on defense. 


- - -

In conclusion, when comparing PG and Harden, when considering that: 

- Harden's best lineups results seem to come alongside PG

- the Clips struggle with Harden+Kawhi on the floor without PG 

- Clips dominate with PG+Kawhi without Harden...

... I'd personally still have PG over Harden, but it's definitely close! || LeBron is definitely still better than both and is having a better season in terms of individual impact. He's top 10 EPM, none of the others you mentioned are. || Steph and Lebron are too old for the 65 game rule to apply right? || I feel like assuming he hits the games limit  - he can afford to miss 2 more games I believe - he'll probably make a team, he's got great numbers when healthy: 27/4/7 on +2.7rTS%; 14th in DPM/ 11th in EPM/ 16th in LEBRON; Suns have a strong +6.8 net rating in Booker-minus-KD minutes which is some crazy impressive floor-raising considering how top-heavily the Suns are constructed (if you're curious they're decent but not as impressive +2.3 in KD minus Book mins)

Book's also a playoff performer and clear top 10ish player that I believe voters may likely defer to over some of his younger less proven counterparts

That being said if the Suns slide in the standings (or if he misses 3 more games) he's probably not getting it so very fair point || Spurs are somehow worse this year than last aren’t they? || Good call! Cavs likely deserve a candidate with their record but Mitchell's out of the running (games played) and Allen has clearly been their 2nd best player.

**Case FOR:** 

- Defensive anchor, probably deserves some DPOY consideration, considering he's been anchoring the number 2 defense in the league without Evan Mobley for most of the season - Cavs have an 80th percentile defense with Allen on the court minus Mobley (87th percentile with both)

- helpful offensive production (16/11/3 w 1.2blks on +7.6rTS%; 31st in DPM/ 64th in EPM/ 32nd in LEBRON - similar impact metric footprint to Jaylen Brown & Jamal Murray). 

- Cleveland are cooking opponents when Mitchell & Allen share the court (+9.4 net rating), and Allen manages to keep them afloat when Mitchell sits (-0.9 net rating) which is impressive.

**Case AGAINST**: 

- Slight mark against him could be the Mitchell-minus-Allen lineups humming along just fine without him (+7.5 net rating) though some of that is likely against bench units so should be taken with a grain of salt.

- Better than Gobert offensively but still more limited on that end compared to most of his competitors for these spots || Just curious, who do you think is the best player on the Orlando Magic?

To me he’s by far the best player but maybe u feel Franz is the best? || Yep, it's ridiculous that he gets a pass on all his weaknesses. He gets consideration for so many accolades, that it's almost Julius Randle-eqsue. || > there’s a special case for season ending injuries

Since when? || I hope Hali doesn’t get it just because of his outspoken hate for the 65 game rule and forcing himself to play to meet it and playing poorly. It would be so ironic if he played poor and cost his team wins instead of just healing up…. All so he could make 240M instead of 200M but doesn’t get it anyways lol || Brown deserves it, period, based on his play all year.

Again, if people can justify AD and LBJ being All NBA, then there should be zero chance that Boston doesn't get 2 as well. || Wow, metrics of metrics (albeit subjective)! I just was curious about the comparison this season and found the 2 overall stats that bball ref displays. I'm guessing part of the problem with Harden is that not only is he bad at aspects of defense, he's well known to be bad, so targeting him is an popular and effective strategy. || There is an inherent problem with using any specific advanced stat as a catch all metric to decide top player lists like some fans do. These statistics are marketed as player comparison stats to attract more views but are best used with an understanding of their flaws to get contextual filtered data on specific questions (for instance, compared to the players past seasons, players with a style extremely similar to them etc.).

They are useless in a comparison of like say, an elite No.3 like Jrue Holiday Vs a good No.2 like Jaylen Brown Vs an average No.1 like Trae Young. The defensive attention, the defensive and playmaking responsibilities, off ball responsibilities etc are just too different to directly compare their stats. They cannot think for you.

To give an example of why advanced metrics are a flawed method to determine a pseudo power ranking of players, this piece has NBA execs weigh in on the most and least reliable advanced numbers based on what they use and PER was the worst out of the 11 stats surveyed. DARKO was the best rated. (https://hoopshype.com/lists/advanced-stats-nba-real-plus-minus-rapm-win-shares-analytics/)

As per DARKO, the All-NBA first team for 2022-23 would be Embiid, Giannis, Tatum, Holiday and Curry.

As per the second best rated system by execs, EPM, the first team for 2022-23 would be Jokic, Dame, Butler, Kawhi and Luka.

As per the third best rated system by execs, LEBRON, the first team for 2022-23 would be Jokic, Giannis, Butler, Mitchell and Luka.

So we can see that even the 3 most trusted advanced stats by teams has not a single player who make all 3 lists under the 1C-2F-2G system. The human media voters however flawed are not idiots and rightly pick Giannis almost unanimously as a first team forward, at the very least. || I didn’t know there was a age limit for it. Is there? || > clear top 10ish

I mean you listed him 12th not counting some injured people that would 100% go above him and you also cited 3 statistics that all had him outside the top 10 (and I think going back to last year doesn't help).

I agree it's a broad tier and precisely ranking them is a fools errand but I think a better description is Top 15-ish. || I think we all need to be honest with ourselves and agree Joseph Howarth Ingles remains the top dog. 
All Joekes aside I think it's hard to argue against Paolo being number 1 based on overall numbers, eye test and who they rely on in the crunch, but Franz is doing amazing work and I'm wide open to any argument in that direction."
Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-04-06,nbadiscussion,1by0tnm,A way to stop Nikola Jokic,"So I've been thinking about how Jokic is on a legendary run and no-one seems to be able to guard him 1 on 1 or stop him as a team, and as a fan of a different NBA franchise that isn't the Nuggets, I want him stopped lmao. So I've come up with a theoretical player archetype who might actually be able to stop jokic, or slow him down at the very least. Please go easy on me this is my first time posting lmao

&#x200B;

Is Jokic even guardable?

The most probable answer is no. Just like All time great in nba history, Nikola Jokic is probably unguardable, you really just have to do your best to make it hard for him and pray he misses. And there lies the problem, no-one makes it hard for Jokic. We've seen players like Lebron, Durant, Steph and Giannis have hard matchups where despite the production, the player was clearly making it hard on them. Lebron had Kawhi Leonard and Andre Iguadala, KD had Tony Allen and PJ Tucker, Steph had Delly and Davion Mitchell. For jokic it's different tho, It's like he's really just flicking his wrist and the ball goes in the hoop without much difficulty. I realize it's probably not easy, he's just so good he makes it look easy but still, no-one has made jokic look genuinely pressed by a defender since he's entered his prime. But I do think it's still possible for a player to perfectly guard him 1 on 1 and give him hell. it just hasn't been done yet  


**What makes Jokic unguardable**

Jokic is what is what nba twitter(idk about reddit lol) calls a point center. He's the fulcrum of the Denver Nuggets offence and directs traffic and creates a favorite matchup for his team. He is mostly a pass first player who's looking to get either open shots for his teammates or easy finishes at the rim, but at the same time he's also an excellent scorer who is still able to deal damage if he is unable to create an open shot for one of his teammates. His combination of strength and touch make him a nightmare in the post, easily backing down defenders before shooting his patented hook shot/floater/layin or a turnaround jumper, which go in more than half the time (55%). He's also a threat from the perimiter with a decent 3 point shot for a center(35%) so you cant just leave him open either. In an attempt to stop him from torching you in the paint, you double, and that often backfires too. He averages 7 assists for his career and is closer to 10 for the past 3 years. He's an elite passes who's probably a top 3 passes of all time. He's basically a 7 foot guard who operates in the post

**My Solution**

If Jokic is a 7 foot guard who operates in the post, **find him a 7 foot guard who guards in the post.** Teams having been matching Nikola Jokic up with centers for years but it can largely be argued it's been a mismatch by looking at the results. So my alternative achetype of defender is basically a tall player, 6'11-7 feet tall with a tall wingspan who can move his feet like a guard and hound the ball. a fast footed big who can full court press and chase jokic around screens. A player who's also strong enough to hold his own on post ups and apply pressure on jokic. Basically a 7 foot Patrick Beverly/Jrue Holiday. I know this player sounds like they don't exist and will never exist but i strongly disagree. Victor Wembanyama and Chet holmgren have shown us that tall players definitely have the capaciuty to develop offensive guard like skills like shooting, tight handles and playmaking, I don't see why they can't develop guard like defensive skills either. We've already seen hints of this possible generation in Victor Wembanyama's perimeter defending, he has great footspeed and recovery, it's definitely possible for him to hound the ball if he so wishes too  


Obviously my solution isn't to have Wemby hound Jokic and pick him up full court LMAO. My theoretical player is a 7 foot defensive specialist like patrick beverly. They may or may not have great offensive tallent but they mainly specialise on defence. In my view, players right now developed they way they are because of how they were trained and coached. The first generations of professional basketball players had begun playing/training basketball seriously at a relatively late stage in their life.  Since basketball is a sport in which height heavily influences your playstyle, tall players naturally gravitated to finishing around the basket and using their height to their advantage and shorter players developed jumpers and layup packages to compensate(Of course there are exceptions like Dirk and Embiid shut up). But no-one says a tall player can't develop a jumper or a layup package, they just never practice it enough. That's where the modern state of basketball development comes in. Players nowadays begin training basketball from the time they are toddlers, they develop offensive weapons which compensate for height long before their height no longer needs compensation. Hence we have players like Kevin Durant and Wemby who offensively resemble guards but with the height of centers. 

So the ideal player is a player who has great defensive insticts from an early age, and is trained in guarding around the perimeter and hounding the ball long before they are ever tall. Allow them to play all defensive positions and require them to master being a pest basically, and let them grow into their phrame while maintaining the defensive excellence. Obviously as they grow taller and taller they will lose some of their speed, so they won't be a literal 7 foot pat bev, they'll be able to use their length to recover, but even on the ocassion that they arent great against guards. they'll be a nightmare against centers. Applying top locking to a center, denying them the ball, using their length to deny entry passes and hounding them with a strong defender strong enough to hold their own, while being fast enough to handle a guard's ball handling/footwork...they won't know what to do with that. Guards have to train their handle every day to prepare for players like that in order to maintain control when bringing up the ball. imagine Jokic trying to bring up the ball only to be full court presses by a guy he cant back down. For the most part bigs who ""bring up the ball"" aren't guarded when trying to initiate the offence from the perimeter. Bam, Sabonis, Jokic, all just bring the ball up and the defense just focuses on getting itself set instead of actually guarding the 7 foot point of attack. My suggested strategy is to develop a 7 foot point of attack defender for guard centers. Fight fire with Fire?",4,61,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1by0tnm/a_way_to_stop_nikola_jokic/,2024-04-07 05:58:54,"Nuggets fan here. Jok is pretty unstoppable, but there are a few things that are more effective than others. First thing is you have to be rough with him and never leave his body, he can get frustrated with hard physicality (fouling essentially without the calls). Draymond does a great job with this. 

Obviously they have to be strong in the post. Jokic's best post move is his righty hook, his first counter is a hook pump into either a spin move, steph through or foul bait. You want to take away his right side and have help ready for the spin back left. Need to have elite rotations tor this help scheme. These are a few things. But they're obviously not silver bullets. || Not that i think there's any real way to stop Jokic or any of the super elite offensive players, but you're literally describing pre-injury Ben Simmons. People love to clown on him now, but that dude was otherworldly on defense before he started having back problems. And the problem with your solution is that he was an extremely rare breed. Guys like that at that size don't come around very often. || The current NBA lacks the sheer offensive and defensive two way talent at the Center position. Most of the best are really Power Forwards which have to play Center due to the modernity of the NBA, or are just good rotational players which isn’t enough. It’s hard to find matchups that are offensively and defensively skilled while having the size to matchup with a Jokic 1 on 1. Joel Embiid is like the only sizeable individual who can matchup well and really test Jokic offensively and defensively. We’d have to use guys like Prime Dwight, Shaq, Hakeem or Duncan as part of a core because they provide two way dominance, along with other great role players.

The 19-20 Lakers pretty much had the formula. Use a serviceable pest and athletic defensive unit in Dwight as a primary defender and have a secondary roaming two way PF/C in AD with a bunch of great 3 and D wings and guards to offset a supporting cast of the Nuggets (albeit Jokic wasn’t at his peak but neither was Dwight). If the 76ers had a healthy Embiid, a better PF/C like a Daniel Gafford, put Harris at the 3 and a legit 3 and D guard like a Divenchenzo alongside Maxey, I’d give them a great shot at face value to dethrone the Nuggets and match or exceed Jokic in production, alongside the current coaching themes. || If going strictly on 1v1 matchup, I’d take prime Draymond Green to cover Joker. He did very well in making it hard for Jokic in 2022. Draymond is hard to move around. He has physicality that, when focused and not flat out hitting people, can help him make up for the difference in height. The steal he had on Jokic to seal Game 3 of their matchup 2 years ago is a testament that smarts/grit can overcome the Joker on occasional plays.

Another problem is that Jokic is one of the toughest shotmakers in league history. We go in awe when Steph, Luka, Bird, MJ, Bron make some crazy circus shots, cause these guys look it so easy like they playin HORSE. Jokic is just as deadly. He can make those crazy shots that demoralize you as a defender. 

Jokic is an all around perfect build as a basketball player on the offensive end. The truest way to guard him is to have him play with mediocre players around him. Otherwise, he will cook you as he does with everyone else. || it has been shown that jokic has a temper so someone like Rodman who is strong enough to annoy him and can play mind game can throw him off. Just pester him hard so he has to try to even touch the ball. Force him off ball pretty much. Closest we have is draymond. || That's what Dwight did in the 2020 WCF. Harassing Jokic in the post, reading the passing lanes. But it has to be a team effort. It was really effective based on the eye test. || Think it’s been mentioned, but the last time joker was really limited by a team was 19-20 lakers in the playoffs. Granted, Jokic hadn’t reached prime jokic levels yet, so who knows what would happen if that matchup occurred today. You can’t beat him with one great defender though. Lakers had to do it with 3 centers in javale, Dwight, and AD, all just wearing him down. Usually Dwight was on ball, AD was the roaming 4. Imagine physically having to back down dwight while also having to worry about AD coming in to block a shot from the backside. This is the kind of situation where joker might then revert to a pass first player, but lakers had fantastic defensive guards/wings in KCP, Caruso, and Danny green. Jokic is pretty fantastic at finding his guys cutting off off ball screens, and lakers were able to somewhat reduce that action with defenders who were able to navigate/fight over screens pretty well. Add rondo and lebron to the mix to call out weird sets, and it was just a perfect combo of IQ, athleticism, and defense to address Jokic. Hard to create that formula again. || Jokic is unstoppable but I think what has shown to work best on him is a strong/sturdy power forward like Rui Hachimura or P.J. Tucker matched up with him and a rim protector to roam the paint and prevent cutting opportunities. The Nuggets still have way too much offensive firepower that they can overcome this, but I think if a team had these two types of players on their roster and also had an equally potent offense, they could win a series against the Nuggets || Check out the stat line on the Milwaukee v Denver matchup from February 12th. || A guy who kinda fits this mold is Jock Londale. Was great guarding Jokic in the Suns series || Your solution has been done already. Every team and every coach has used every defensive schemes they have to stop him and failed. ...try focusing on his teammates. || Best strategy to stop a good offensive player is to have a defensive specialist at said position. Not exactly a eureka moment tbh ||  I think the best way To defend him is to defend the rest of the team, he’s a playmaker, he’s gonna get his 40 whether you guard him or not but if cut off the rest of the teams production, they lose. If you can keep Jamal and MPJ cold from outside, you’ve given yourself a chance, let Jokic feast on his inside 2s then try out score them with 3s on the other end || He is too strong for the 5 out system... generally people at the center with good 3 point shooting skills aren't that strong.. a traditional center might stop him or make him less effective.. but will himder your team at the offensive end... if you dont he will just bully his way to his spots, and pass to the open man when doubled || historically the best way to stop Jokic is to match him in size and to occupy him defensively 

Embiid does a really good job on him , but almost no one has that . || if i could build a player like 2k to stop him it’d be someone very strong to prevent him from posting up as easily while being good at pestering his dribble/getting steals || So this imaginary player also has offensive skills, I assume? Otherwise you’re giving up your post attack. So your plan is “make an enormous guy super fast and super good on both sides of the ball.” 
I can tell you that this works, I did it on EA sports NBA all the time. || People seem to think that Jokic is KD, Embiid, or Luka aka Iso players. The reason that Jokic is so good is that he’s an amazing off-ball player. A big part of Jokic’s points come through putbacks, mismatches, cuts, spot ups, and rolls to the basket. 

Even if your theoretical player existed what happens when Jamal Murray comes off a pick and roll and he’s forced to help leaving Jokic rolling to the rim. 

This is what makes players like Jokic, LeBron, and Steph unstoppable they are not only amazing on ball players but off ball as well. || Need someone to pick him up full court. And someone to protect the paint. You can give Aaron Gordon the corner 3 bc he only shoots 29%. Then you gotta make him work on your offensive possessions, run him into a lot of high PnR’s || Totally. Small stocky guys are given a much longer leash to be extra physical. PJ Tucker the other night vs Clippers for instance. || Ya it's well-documented that the best way to stop Jokic is to just have someone foul him every single time. It will only get called half the time, and once in a while they'll call it the wrong way. This gets Jokic into foul trouble and more frustrated, he'll start turning it over more and his defense goes from borderline great to total sieve. 

Dwight Howard, Jock Landale, and Draymond Green have all given Jokic fits in a playoff series with this strategy. 

Nuggets win the bubble ring if Dwight plays his defense straight up instead of intentionally fouling out as much as possible (not saying they didn't deserve it, that was a brilliant strategy) || The main problem is that Jokic is practically telepathically aware of when and where all the rotations and help coverage is coming from. The second you even think about doubling or helping, he's slinging an impossible pass to an open teammate.

I think he's completely unguardable. I can't even think of a way to make things difficult for him. He's just on another level. He pretty much does whatever he wants to out there. You're at his mercy. || This is the only thing I've seen that works. Mental and physical fatigue. He's incredibly tough and focused but if you confuse him enough, move him around and show him different looks he will start to look mortal. || Yeah prime Ben Simmons would've terrorized teams as a defensive anchor. He could hold up in the post and full court press as well as get steals with his length. Pretty sad what injuries did to him || The only other person I could see having the tools described by OP is Jonathan Isaac. Unfortunately, he isn’t healthy enough to show everyone what he is capable of || The other problem with that solution is that usually you need a guard to be effective at facilitating and creating offense, or your team won’t be able to score enough to keep up with a quality team like the Nuggets. The Ben Simmons 76ers couldn’t keep up with the 20-21 Hawks, I very much doubt they could keep up with the present day Nuggets. || Embiid is gassed out too early they try to hide him which is not knock on him, its just Jokics motor is out of this world || 76ers did something very Similar with PJ Tucker on Jokic and Embiid roaming and it worked pretty well. I think Batum will be who they try this time around but who knows if we see that matchup. || Dray did good because Nuggets were historycally bad and he was playing 1v5. And even that series after first 2 good games Jokic was averaging like 38 games 3-5 and Dray was benched || Yeah but I'm talking about a certified jokic stopper.

Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-11-01,nbadiscussion,1gh6zyq,"Jersey Shore, Kenny Atkinson, Evan Mobley, and more: how the Cleveland Cavaliers have changed for the better","Millennials of a certain age may fondly remember a dumb, wildly popular show called “Jersey Shore,” about a bunch of older-than-you-realized alcoholics living in a party house in the eponymous area.

“Jersey Shore” was immensely and desperately a product of its time, an era Gen Zers may mix up with the Cretaceous. Understandably so. Certain things that have become commonplace today, like smartphones, social media, etc., were just beginning to pick up steam. We weren’t quite as connected to the digital world; things felt smaller then, for better or worse.

Most relevantly for this article, Uber, Lyft, and their ilk weren’t around yet. In order to safely imbibe a few beverages at a bar, people had to order these things called taxis, or cabs, for transportation.

Back then, the cabs’ arrival was a harbinger of joy. They often took an hour to show up, so it was a genuinely exciting moment when they finally parked at the door. The night beckoned, and the cab’s honking if you took even two seconds to materialize at your door was simply fun curling its finger at you to come join.

And *boy* did the “Jersey Shore” cast enjoy their cabs. “THE CABS AH HE-YEAH!” Pauly D would bleat when he saw a glimpse of yellow outside their abode’s sea-salt-blurred windows. “THE CABS AH HE-YEAH!”

10% of you are nodding wistfully, nostalgic for a time of what retroactively seems like incomprehensible inconvenience. The other 90% of you are confused as hell, so to get a sense of what I mean: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyQIqiivWyw&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyQIqiivWyw&t=2s)

This overly elaborate intro was created (obviously, I’d assume) so that I could kick things off the only way I know how:

“THE CAVS AH HE-YEAH!”

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone knew the Clevevland Cavaliers would be *good*. They’ve been good for years, thanks to an elite defense featuring perpetual DPOY contender Evan Mobley and perpetually underappreciated Jarrett Allen. With the usual small sample size caveats, though, it's astonishing how great they've looked to start the season.

I’m not here to discuss the D much, but a few things stand out. They’re switching a lot more often. Including Dean Wade in the starting lineup makes them legitimately giant, and Wade has held up well against the point of attack when he inevitably switches onto ballhandlers. Mitchell has been an underrated defender since he first flew into Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, and Darius Garland is quietly working harder on that end than ever before.

So the defense was never a question. This year, the Cavs decided to switch out the blunt training swords they’ve been bringing to fights for frightening artillery. That strategy — playing modern offense and making shots — has worked wonders, and [Cleveland’s offense](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors) is actually ranked one spot better than its third-place defense.

What’s changed? It starts at the top. J.B. Bickerstaff was fired last season despite taking the team into the second round of the playoffs. New hire Kenny Atkinson was given two related directives: fix the team’s offense and figure out how to make Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen work together.

Five games into the season, the changes are apparent and promising.

Although the Cavs are shooting roughly the same percentage of shots at the rim and from deep as last year, they’ve shifted several of their threes from above the break to the corners (a higher-percentage look) — most notably from Garland and Mitchell.

The ballhandling is more diversified this season, freeing up Garland and Mitchell for more off-ball actions to get them open looks. So much activity is happening that defenders eventually have to slip up. Look at this: \[[video clip here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/how-the-cleveland-cavaliers-have)\]

Mmm-hmm. That’s sexy basketball, right there.

Truth be told, though, that play is a little misleading, the exception that proves the rule. Although the general concepts are true (drive, kick, rinse, repeat until an open shot emerges), the Cavs are actually making [30 fewer passes per game this season than last](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/passing?SeasonType=Regular+Season&dir=D&sort=PASSES_MADE&Season=2024-25), a 10% drop. To be clear, it’s not that the ball movement is bad (Boston and Dallas, for example, regularly rank near the bottom in passes per game). It’s that the Cavs are opening up good shots sooner.

The Cavaliers [averaged 17.2 wide-open threes per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/shots-closest-defender?CloseDefDistRange=6%20%20Feet%20-%20Wide%20Open&DateTo=10/26/2024&Season=2023-24&dir=D&sort=FG3A) last year (and shot 39.6%); this season, that number is up to 19.3 (and they’re shooting an NBA-best 55.2% on those attempts). A directive from Atkinson to play faster has paid off so far; Cleveland took [an average of 12.1 seconds ](http://stats.inpredictable.com/nba/ssnTeamShot.php?season=2023&po=0&frdt=2024-10-22&todt=2024-10-31&view=off)to get a shot up last year but has needed just 11.5 tick-tocks this season.

They’ve gone away from some of their old bread-and-butter offensive stuff. They’ve dropped from [fifth in the league in elbow touches](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/touches?Season=2023-24&dir=D&sort=ELBOW_TOUCHES) to 20th (although I should also point out they lead the league by a metric mile in [points per elbow touch](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/touches?dir=D&sort=PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH) this season). All those passes to players at the free-throw line have instead been replaced by an emphasis on perimeter drives to the basket.

Last year, C[leveland averaged 49 drives per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/drives?Season=2023-24&dir=D&sort=DRIVES), 17th in the league. This year, they’re rocketing to the paint [nearly 60 times per night](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/drives?dir=D&sort=DRIVES), the third-most, and those drives are *working*. When they choose to shoot off a drive, they lead the league with a 58% FG%; they also have a higher assist share off drives than anyone else. Every time they get two feet into the paint, good things happen.

The change is most evident in Evan Mobley, who has taken the basketball intelligentsia’s orders to develop a three-pointer, balled them up, and dunked them into a trash can. Atkinson has empowered Mobley to bring up the ball, so instead of trying to become a volume three-point shooter (something unlikely to ever be in his future), Mobley has leveled up his ballhandling, unlocking new methods of scoring two-pointers.

His [time of possession has risen dramatically](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/touches?CF=TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*cle&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&dir=D&sort=TOUCHES). Instead of initiating everything at the catch on the elbow, Mobley is starting from the perimeter more often. He drives nine times per game, twice as many as last year and just a couple fewer than Mitchell, eviscerating defenders with physicality and twitchy length.

Mobley is noticeably stronger, and he’s not shy about showing it off. Watch as he gets a smaller Max Christie on him after the pick from guard Ty Jerome and simply bulldozes the poor sod like so much mulch: \[[video clip here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/how-the-cleveland-cavaliers-have)\]

A more confident handle has turned Mobley into a monster in transition (92nd percentile in points per transition possession, per Synergy), taking it coast to coast with surprising aplomb no matter which royalty is in the way: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/how-the-cleveland-cavaliers-have)\]

More intriguingly for nerds like me, he’s also running four pick-and-rolls per game despite logging just 36 such possessions all last season. Coach Atkinson loves to have a shooter (often Sam Merrill) set the inverted screen, forcing defenses into challenging situations. I’m particularly fond of these snug inverted P&Rs, set inside the three-point line to give defenders even less margin for error as Mobley steams toward the hoop: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/how-the-cleveland-cavaliers-have)\]

Mobley could still stand to tighten up his handle even more, and the next step for him is figuring out how to make more plays for others off the dribble. But the change in confidence and usage has led directly to an increase in efficient scoring (nearly 20 points per game, up 3.5 from last season!).

The lanky power forward is hardly the only one who’s changed. The Cleveland guards are being used differently, too. Darius Garland is having the bounce-back year I hoped for. On a per-minute basis, he’s averaging career highs in points, steals, blocks, and three-pointers attempted. Donovan Mitchell is at or close to career highs in those things, too.

Garland is zooming around off-ball and finishing a higher share of his possessions on catch-and-shoot opportunities. He’s doing a better job at getting up threes that he would’ve passed up or dribbled through before: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/how-the-cleveland-cavaliers-have)\]

Garland is averaging [3.4 catch-and-shoot](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629636/shots-dash?Season=2024-25) three-point attempts this season compared to 2.5 last year, and it’s given the offense more office space to work in.

Mitchell, meanwhile, is forcing the issue in transition, pirouetting to the hoop for layups or kickouts with his proprietary mix of power, grace, and secret spice blends. He chains together moves like a 2K player. [Shammgod](https://youtu.be/o_zvev7vDMI?si=Gv6cd51gWW8FyB8f&t=107) to spin to floater and-one?

I don’t think people realize how plain *fun* it is to watch Donovan Mitchell play basketball. Look at the effort *and* the style here! \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/how-the-cleveland-cavaliers-have)\]

The difference in usage for three of Cleveland’s Big Four has made things easier for the final member. Center and oft-rumored trade piece Jarrett Allen is scoring more than last year, too, despite shooting two fewer shots — that’s what happens when you boast a league-leading 79% FG%.

Most importantly, the Allen/Mobley minutes — which sang defensively and wheezed offensively last season — are clear-cut winners on both sides. Those lineups are scoring 121 points per 100 possessions, 86th percentile leaguewide, and boast a net rating that looks like a typo.

One interesting subplot: before the season, the team lost Max Strus, the presumed starter at the three, until at least December. Replacement Dean Wade doesn’t have Strus’ quick trigger, but he’s a respected shooter (despite his slow start to the season) with one key advantage: massiveness. Wade is a legit 6’10”, and he has just enough defensive quickness to stay in front of most guards and wings (as long as Mobley and Allen are behind him to help). Having him in the starting lineup gives the Cavs a monstrous backline to support having two smaller guards up top.

Wade is also a smart passer and an excellent all-around connector whose advanced metrics have always shone like a particularly pasty sun. If the Allen/Mobley lineups continue to play well, and Wade stays healthy (always a question with him), it’s far from certain that Strus will stroll right back into his starting job when he returns.

Like a few other coaches (notably Taylor Jenkins in Memphis and Steve Kerr in Golden State), Atkinson has leaned heavily upon his bench this season, curtailing the starters’ minutes to keep them fresh, aggressive, and (hopefully) healthy. Caris LeVert has taken a smaller role than in years past, but he hasn’t missed a shot all season (seriously: he’s shooting nearly 70% from the field and 64% from deep). Georges Niang has found his stroke again after a godawful playoff run, and while Sam Merrill has started the season cold, his screening prowess and floor-spacing abilities are a perfect fit for Atkinson’s whirring offensive system. Isaac Okoro is playing fewer minutes, too, but he still brings voracious perimeter defense when the Cavs simply must have a stop.

I also have to spare a word for Ty Jerome, the former Virginia Cavalier turned Cleveland Cavalier (“CAVS AH HE-YEAH!”). I’m stunned by how much Jerome we’ve seen this season; in just 15 minutes per game, he’s averaging 11.4 points and 3.4 assists, largely on the back of a funky, arrhythmic floater game: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/how-the-cleveland-cavaliers-have)\]

There are some warning signs we need to acknowledge. The Cavaliers probably won’t have an effective field goal percentage of 61% all season long (Boston led the league last year with a 58% eFG%). You’ll notice the above text was peppered with a lot of “career highs” and “league-leading” descriptors. Cleveland will eventually miss some shots.

But we *know* this team will stay dominant defensively (even more so than expected if Wade plays a big role). The fly in Cleveland’s soup has always been playoff offense. Opposing defenses took advantage of the lack of pace and the lack of space that the Cavaliers, particularly with Mobley and Allen on the floor, possessed.

Space is a funny thing. Sure, shooting creates it, but it’s also something the best players can eat up. If Mobley plays this well with the ball, and everyone else continues to run hard and make shots at a reasonable clip, the Cavs should be far more equipped to score in the playoffs than they have been. With a defense this good, they don’t need the league’s best offense to make the Conference Finals.

So, yeah, “THE CAVS AH HE-YEAH!” And they don’t seem likely to leave anytime soon.",136,14,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1gh6zyq/jersey_shore_kenny_atkinson_evan_mobley_and_more/,2024-11-01 10:41:44,"If you made it all the way, thanks for reading! I've collected a bunch of illustrative video clips that [can all be viewed in context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/how-the-cleveland-cavaliers-have). I'm super into what the Cavs are doing, and I like that they're doing it despite two non-shooting bigs on the roster. More diversity in the league, more ways to succeed, can only be a good thing.

And if you have no idea what Jersey Shore is, honestly, count your blessings. || Awesome write up! Big Cavs fan here so I’ll always stop to read through - it’s nice to see the differences we’ve clearly seen with Atkinson backed up with some stats.

The Chasedown Podcast talked about the Cavs decreasing their passes per possession, and I think I agree with their take that this decrease is because the Cavs are shooting when they get a shot and not overcooking the offense - not making perfect the enemy of good. There have been a possession or two in each of the first five games where they do overcook the offense, but I like that they’re letting shots fly as soon as they come.

One small quibble is that I’m not sure broader NBA discourse reflected the assertion that people knew the Cavs were going to be good this year - with the Knicks transformation, Sixers adding PG, Bucks having the best playing in the East in Giannis, the Celtics (enough said), the media I was consuming seemed to put the Cavs in a tier below this teams, with the prediction that we’d be fighting for home court advantage with the above teams as well as a new and improved Orlando, and a Pacers team that just made an ECF run. With the Cavs running it back with our same roster, everyone seemed to think the Cavs would be decent, but inherent roster flaws capped their ceiling much lower than what we are seeing now.

The season is 82 games, and we’ve only seen 5 from the Cavs, but I think this team competes for the 2 seed this season, which I think I can confidently say that no one thought that would be the case at the beginning of the season. || why do we talk about jersey shore as an old show.  i just watched the new episode last night. || Dude this was amazing. Generally I don't have fond memories of or nostalgia for Jersey Shore but thats a fun phrase with a cool sorta niche backstory, super well written and illustrated. Definitely a lot of nostalgia for that time period though, a lot of the advantages of internet and modern tech but social media and in particular online stuff (everything from streaming to shopping to ride share services you alluded to) hadn't absolutely just taken over dya to day life. 

Cavs are also killing it, Mobley in particular seems to have taken the leap many had predicted last season. A winning team with a somewhat unique style of play is great for everyone even if you hate the Cavs or have a 3 point fetish or whatever other aversion that may not make them your cup of tea. || Thank you! And yeah, I dont think saying a team will be fighting for the four seed is disrespectful whatsoever, but clearly the Cavs have started stronger than that (and their peers have looked worse than expected). A 2 seed should be the goal for sure. || Everything I was reading throughout the offseason predicted the Cavs at 5-7th or so in the East. You're definitely right about that. And Reddit certainly did not take the team seriously (usually just memes about standing pat in a conference where many teams upgraded their rosters, at least on paper.)


The Average Person seemed to think the Cavs would finish behind Boston, NY, Indy, Philly, Orlando, and Milwaukee. But their two biggest obstacles last season were coaching (potentially solved) and HEALTH (remains to be seen!) As a young team with bad luck and bad coaching last year, there was every reason to believe they would improve this year, but people disregarded them because of a lack of splashy offseason moves.  || Agreed - I was among the crowd who thought that this roster construction had capped out and wanted at least one of DG/Allen to be moved for a starting wing. I knew that JB was part of the problem, but I definitely underestimated the effect Atkinson would have on the 2-big offensive conundrum. They’re absolutely humming on both ends. || lol I’m talking when it was brand new! Did they reboot or something? || Thanks!

And yeah, that’s how I feel. I’m glad that teams like the Cavs have found different ways to generate points || A top 2 seed. A 1 would be fine lol.

Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-11-15,nbadiscussion,1gt5g0d,De'Aaron Fox's Recent Play,"I think it's time that we finally give De'Aaron Fox his flowers. The way he has been playing to start the year makes me believe that he could be the legit #1 scoring option on a championship team (not to say that the Kings are a championship caliber team, because they're obviously not).

Needless to say, I have been really impressed with how efficiently he has scored the ball to start the year, and I just don't think there is nearly enough conversation around him. 

Fox provides so much value to Sacramento, yet often times Sabonis is the one that gets a lot of the credit or conversation. Even though Sabonis is in a sense the engine of Sacramento's offense, I believe Fox is clearly their best player. He is one of the best scoring guards in the league and a capable player on the defensive end especially considering the lack of defensive talent around him.

I would like to get the sub's temperature on Fox, maybe I am too high on him, but I think he is a top 20-25 player in the league and in the Kyrie, Ja, Haliburton tier of guards. However, with his recent play, I think he is closer to approaching the Mitchell, Booker, Brunson tier than we may like to admit.",66,27,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1gt5g0d/deaaron_foxs_recent_play/,2024-11-16 23:16:46,"He's been this good for 3 seasons now. 2 years ago his 3 was bad, Last year took a leap in 3s but his ft were bad.

I think his case is helped significantly by Morant still finding his feet and what unfortunately seems to have been a legit post-injury regression of Halliburton, but at the very least, right now, he's playing the best of the guards you mentioned.

He plays in SAC though mate, so he'll be lucky to be an all star for yet another year. || Give him his flowers? 

You wrote a long post arguing he is arguably a top 25 player. He was named all NBA third team all nba. He's ranked 22 in the ringer 100, 26 on ESPN. In both of those he is ranked ahead of Sabonis.

He's an excellent player. He isn't going to get to the Mitchell/booker/Brunson level until he makes some noise in the playoffs.

Why do people think that every player is underrated or disrespected? || Tbf Fox’s play before these past two games has been hit or miss. The biggest difference has been his renewed willingness to attack the paint. He’s focusing on high percentage shots and hitting middys/threes when they’re available. He started the year by shooting a ton of threes (and missing many of them). Fortunately, he’s pivoted when the Kings need him the most. He’s re-discovered what made him so successful in 2022-23. Let’s hope it continues. The Kings could be a legit threat if he keeps this up when DeRozan, Sabonis, and Monk return. || Prior to them trading Haliburton when his value was likely the lowest, I was really hoping the Pistons would've traded for him. I love Fox. Ivey is now what I thought Fox would be in terms of a complement to Cade, but obviously Fox is significantly better lol  

He should've probably been an all-star last year, hope he is again this year.  Glad to see him getting more attention || Fox was 5th in the league last year in clutch scoring providing 122 clutch points, just above Jalen Brunson on similar efficiency. The big difference is that Brunson was +59 while Fox was -2 in the clutch. A good thing for Sacto is that DeRozan was 2nd in the league and had a massive +94 plus/minus so that should give the Kings a couple more wins.   Other interesting players in the clutch were Ant at similar 43% fgs but with -44, Trae Young at 41% and -55. Malik Monk is also high on the list at 51% and +24!

So far this season Fox is leading the league in clutch scoring (45 so far) at 53% and +21. DeRozan is 4th btw :)

Your post is a little conflicting. You think he can be a #1 option on a championship team and also have him in the top 20-25 range, that doesn't make sense.

He was already in the Kyrie / Hali tier.

Also not a big fan of people 'giving flowers' and making judgements right after a good stretch of games as recency bias has a huge impact. || Fox's advanced numbers so far this year are a bit better than last year, but worse (especially the AST% and TOV%) than 2022-23 (which was his best season overall, and the Kings were 1st in OffRtg that year). He's shooting more from the outside this year, but the tradeoff is that he's getting to the line less too.  
    
He's obviously not going to be exactly the same every year, and there's plenty of time for things to rise, but he's not really doing anything at the moment that he hasn't done before. || Fox is a top 25 player and just had an incredible stretch, but he needs to be more consistent if we're going to lock him into the top 20. The NBA has never been more stacked with stars and while Fox's shooting has continually improved, his efficiency at the rim has been very underwhelming the last few seasons, holding back his best attribute as a player (superhuman speed with the ball in his hands). || Thanks for giving Fox some shine. He’s been great for us for years now. He was the Clutch Player of the Year two seasons ago and he’s one of the top closers in the league.

He’s definitely paying the small market/Sacramento tax. If he played for another team he would definitely be in those elite player discussions, kind of like Haliburton as soon as he went to the Pacers.

One aspect of his game that doesn’t get enough recognition is his defense. When the game is in crunch time, he’s one of the league’s best two-way players. His lateral movement and twitchiness are unmatched and he’s also the league steals leader at 2.0 steals per game (statmuse). He’s not a liability on defense and doesn’t get targeted on that end, unlike some of the more popular pgs across the league.

So yes - put some respect on De’Aaron Fox’s name. || Yah, it's been a while now, really since they traded Hali. 

And for all the talk about Haliburton, I think Fox has been the better and more valuable player.

Crazy thing is, he's been shooting the ball really well this year, but his 3-ball has been really streaky. If he shoots it like he did the last few years he's a 30 ppg scorer. || [removed] || Which is really unfortunate, because he deserved to be an all-star if not all-nba last year. But I expect a similar fate for him this year too. || Yah just seeing how well Ivey and Cade fit, I could only imagine what Fox would look like next to Cade. Those two would be really lethal next to one another. That is the thing about Fox that is so appealing to me. I feel like he can fit seamlessly next to so many star players in the league, whether it be a big, a wing, or even another guard.

It is a shame that he is stuck next to Sabonis and DeRozan for the foreseeable future. Not that either of them are bad players, they're both terrific. There is just a hard ceiling with those 2 next to Fox that wouldn't exist if he were next to a number of other players that fit his style better. || > And for all the talk about Haliburton, I think Fox has been the better and more valuable player.
> 
> 

This is some crazy recency bias.

Haliburton was All-NBA last year and led the league in assists. Fox is a volume scorer on below average efficiency who doesn't set up teammates remotely as well as Haliburton and doesn't space the floor or play off the ball nearly as well, either (98 TS+ last year for Fox, exactly on his career number, and 104 for Haliburton, also exactly on his career number). And the scoring gap between them last season was just 6 points -- despite Haliburton doubling Fox up in assists and doing everything far more efficiently. Fox actually averaged more turnovers than Haliburton despite 5 fewer assists per game.

Fox deserves credit for his start to this season, especially the last couple of games with DeMar and Sabonis hurt. I don't know why that credit has to come in the form of a shot at another player on another team. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || It’s hard to be an All-Star in a conference with Luka (fans will vote him in even if he plays the same way as he does right now), SGA and rejuvenated Steph. Then we add a new shining toy in Ant, Booker who is having a pretty good season so far and even Kyrie who has arguably been Mavs best player so far this seasons: that’s already 6 quality guards without even taking into account Ja; competition among West guards is brutal. || Agreed with the context comment. He's in a great context, but it does feel like there's a hard ceiling on this team. Maybe if Fox makes a leap, though, that ceiling gets pushed upwards a bit? Not sure, but it's definitely feasibly. I think they'd need to snag a few gritty defensive role players to really round out a championship roster but I don't think it's *too* far away if he makes a leap. Lots of ifs though || >Haliburton was All-NBA last year and led the league in assists.

I never understood why they rushed that trade.  Everyone was saying they didn't fit together, but Mike Brown probably could have made it work with a season or two.  They're fundamentally two different players, with two very different playing styles, and Haliburton can guard most SGs.  We're not talking CJ McCollum and Dame here we're they have the same weaknesses, and do the same things.  

Also, with Haliburton's penchant for getting injured, it's not like Fox won't get plenty of shots to run the offense without Haliburton.  They could have had a Manu/Tony thing going.  

Sabonis is great, but he's undersized in the West as a Center.  The Timberwolves did Denver and Sacramento a huge favor by getting rid of one of its three 7 footers.  But Sabonis has more value in the East. || You might be the one with recency bias. Two years ago, Fox made All NBA, was at 103 TS+, and won CPOY. Last year he led the league in steals in addition to his offensive contributions. He often guards the other team’s best guard or wing. He’s become a much more impactful player than Tyrese on the defensive end. 

It’s not really fair to compare assists, since Fox does not initiate the offense on most every possession like Hali does. The turnover thing is a fair point. Fox’s tend to happen when he needs to create a shot, though, so that also is impacted by the difference in their roles. || > It’s not really fair to compare assists, since Fox does not initiate the offense on most every possession like Hali does

That's because he's not nearly as good at it as Haliburton is. How is that ""not really fair"" to compare the entire concept of setting up your teammates and running an offense? That's completely absurd. || Tell me you don’t watch the Kings without telling me you don’t watch the Kings lol. 

I explained why in the part you quoted. It’s very simple. Sabonis initiates the offense on most possessions, so Fox doesn’t have nearly as many opportunities to get assists as Hali. Fox doesn’t even touch the ball on many possessions where DeRozan, Murray, or Huerter score."

The early 2000s were super iso centric, the best player on the team would usually have the ball in jis hands for 10-12 seconds at a time most possessions and it would result in a more 1v1 type game. That doesnt lend itself to a lot of steals. 

The modern era is very much the opposite. Its not rare to see possessions where all 5 offensive players have the ball in their hands. As such, since the ball is moving around more there’s more opportunity to steal it || More ball movement = more passing = lesser skilled players getting the ball = occasional bad plays = more turnovers || Idk exactly why but I noticed the steals numbers and just the stats overall come against the same bunch of culprits. Teams that push pace bc they can’t stop anyone. Or the tankathon teams that aren’t good enough to not turn it over 20 times a game. || Agree with all the good points posted above, only new point I’d add is, the data shows that steals create an incredibly valuable offensive possession going the other way.  So what was once considered ‘bad defense’ because a player is gambling and allowing a back door cut is now being baked into the calculus by some coaching staffs, for some players.  It can actually be part of the scheme to allow Westbrook to roam as a free safety if you trust Jokic behind him to deter the potential 2 on 1 created by a missed gamble.  If you allow 2 back door layups per game but get 3 pick-6 steals at half court that lead to easy dunks, maybe your gambling strategy paid off. || This is funny because last year was actually the lowest steal per possession rate in NBA history.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/s/z9gbwo5fM9

It's way too early to make conclusions about these types of things and it's normal for the first few weeks to be much sloppier than the rest of the season as players find their groove but it is interesting to think about.

Of course with more possessions, the number of steal opportunities rises and thus the number of steals will also go up. What you might not know though, is that the NBA actually averaged more possessions during a lot of those 60s-80s seasons and at the same time, those players were often playing 36-40 minutes per game for the entire season so seemingly it's not just about the possessions.

We don't have steal (or block) numbers for the 60s so we don't know how many Jerry West was averaging but I am guessing that it was something as ridiculous if not more than Daniels when you consider the fact that he led the league in steals at age 35, his final season and the first year they recorded steals at nearly 3spg.

Unless you use a rate statistic that can adjust for minutes played and/or possessions it's hard to say exactly how or why those numbers are going up. Maybe it's just noise and it will even back out by mid season. Maybe Daniels is hitting his stride and is Alvin Robertson/Mookie Blaylock 3.0 and will keep it going. Maybe he got lucky and will have below average numbers for the rest of the year. Only time will tell.

I think it's safe for you, as a Dyson Daniels fan to assume, Dyson is a great on ball defender whose versatility and lateral quickness is going to allow for him to have a very long career barring any serious injury. || To me it seems the regular season is becoming increasingly unserious, and ALL stats are inflated because of this. We're having more possessions and looser play. Just a theory || Lazy passes on offense. Selfishness on offense - seems guys aren't as willing to move off ball.

Random subs and mismatched lineups. Teams going for 'potential' with young, inexperienced players instead of trying to win. || This happens early in the season usually as teams settle into their offensives a lot of teams run new stuff or have new personnel and that takes time to get used to which creates mistakes. || More playings taking chances going for steals.

Australia has a huge amount of NBA young players plus VETs with great chemistry: Patty Mills, Josh Giddey, Dante Exum, Dyson Daniels, Josh Green, Joe Ingles, Jock Landale, Jack McVeigh, Matisse Thybulle, Duop Reath, Johnny Furphy. Plus some first rounders coming through: Proctor, Zikarsky. 

Serbia has a bunch of Nikola’s who keep multiplying. We know they don’t mess around.

France has that guy named Wemby who will be a one man team. Gobert, Sarr, Fournier, Yabusele.

Don’t get me started on Canada. SGA, Murray, Dort, Barrett, Nembhard, Brooks, Olynyk, NAW.

Sure the talent is with USA but talent goes so far in international competition and has only allowed USA to just get by in recent years. || People are naming stars but lets be realistic, looking at 2012, who can you envision being at the level of 2012 version of Lebron, Wade, Kobe, Melo, CP3, KD in the next Olympics?  That is the thing, we will have stars, team USA seems to be lacking that big transcendent star. Cooper Flagg may be him but lets see. || No chance Embiid is on the team in 28 AD I think would but it’s closer to 50/50 than a sure thing

I’m interested to see if Tatum even plays next Olympics 

It being in La and Kerr not being the HC I would assume he does, but if not that’s a much bigger loss than most people would care to admit  

Most of the guards you listed outside of Booker and Mitchell are more interested in “getting theirs” than winning games (and Booker was like that before cp3 came to the suns) 

Gotta be able to switch and defend for international ball, can’t call sell either

I would not assume they’re in great hands, especially seeing that USA needed clutch performances from curry and Lebron to keep them even medaling || I’d post this as a suggestion of the exact opposite.  That it’s looking scary in the next Olympics for team USA .   The old school elite elite talent in the nba is aging and won’t play (curry LeBron and kd) and the new top elite level talent ( Luka, sga, joker, giannnis) aren’t from the US. It’s good for basketball and bad for the USA. || None of these guys are premier shooters which is what most games come down to these days. 

5 out basketball with good shooters is what wins today. It’s what the Celtics played and Nuggets played the last two years

It’s why we almost lost to Serbia but we stayed attached due to Steph’s shooting || Team USA is always the best team on paper. With aged players dominating minutes last Olympics, this next roster can be expected to have significantly less minutes together than other world Olympic rosters. || Usa will likely have  the 2nd to 6th best players on the court at any given matchup even if there may be a matchup where the best player is on the other team


They will remain strong favorites even in the single game format || This is a lot of cope.

European style basketball is superior because it develops big men better, and big men are the most important positions on the floor.

Yes, America has a ton of guard talent. This is established. However, something has to change. I will root for Team USA failure until the youth pipeline is overhauled, and we stop seeing AAU being an iso-fest of guards, with bigs doing nothing but rim running and no one sharing the ball. || I think there's a good shot USA loses next Olympics. The Europeans are better built for the Olympics. They are better coached, have better chemistry, move the ball better, shoot better, understand the rules better. The USA is always at a disadvantage and especially when the players are used to NBA rules + spacing. I don't see 3 guys who can properly fill in for Steph / KD / LeBron but I could be wrong. || Without several super star level players US has no chance vs other powerhouses || [removed] || For the 2028 Olympics, 12 players born between 01/07/1999 and 31/06/2003 (ages 25-29 as of 31/06/2028), in their absolute prime:

The US will win the Gold in an absolute canter, *again*, and everything will be fine. || Literally played 71 games last season wtf || I agree. The USA was close to losing this year with Steph/KD/LeBron || I agree with you, but when it's phrased like that it sounds like a big deal but look at the reality:

SGA, Canada, they've got a solid squad. Not on USA level but filled with good players and will be good competition. Though USA has several players who are at or near SGA's level also so the ""best player on the court"" could very well be Tatum, Embiid, Ant, AD, Donovan Mitchell, etc.

Wemby, France, they have a lot of long athletic interesting players who could be a nightmare defensively but are mostly theoretical on offense and can't shoot. Definitely one to watch, but they have a ways to go before they truly rival USA, even if Wemby is the world's best player in 2028.

Jokic, Serbia, only have 1 other player in the country under 30 who is getting minutes in the NBA, Nikola Jovic. They are a very skilled country that pumps out solid int'l players and shouldn't be taken lightly, but the talent gap is surprisingly large with them. Plus Jokic will be 33 in 2028 and might be slowing down a little.

Luka & Giannis have nowhere near the teammate talent to matter.

Other countries like Germany, Spain, and Australia will be competitive but don't have the elite talent to factor into the concern you raised about an elite talent disadvantage, though Franz Wagner and Sengun are ballers and could add Germany or Spain's name to this list really soon. || Embiid is not playing in 2028, come on || I don't think Tatum will decline, isn't it an Olympics on home turf? He'll be the face of Team USA and would have a chance to win his 3rd gold. Jaylen I could see declining for obvious reasons. || Only way Tatum declines is if Kerr coaches again.

He has a long history of playing for team USA and he’d love a chance for redemption. Just not the type to say no.

His camp complained, but I don’t think Tatum ever criticized Kerr || Booker played that role pretty well in the Olympics this year || Single elimination highly favors gameplanning for things like 3 point shooting, that's really the issue. In a 7 game series no country stands a chance still, but that's not international ball. You beat the USA on streaking 3 point variance. || We removed your comment for being low effort.

Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-12-08,nbadiscussion,1halrfh,This years Cavaliers reminds me of the 2014-15 Hawks which is a great thing. ,"The Hawks finished the season with a 60–22 record for a franchise high in wins, earning them the first seed in the Eastern Conference and home court advantage for the Conference. 

They lost to the Lebron James Cavaliers in the ECF that season ironically. 

They are a great regular season time but don’t have the star power to compete with the top 3-4 teams in the playoffs. Donovan Mitchell is great and is a superstar. He just isn’t in the upper echelon tier with Jokic, Doncic, or even Tatum. 

Same for supporting cast. They are great but none are as elite as Jaylen Brown, Kyrie, or Jamal Murray(championship run). 


Edit: everyone says 04 pistons is much better comparison and I agree. Thanks for correcting me. ",89,51,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1halrfh/this_years_cavaliers_reminds_me_of_the_201415/,2024-12-09 17:03:09,"[removed] || Donovan Mitchell isn’t on the level of those names but this man has scored 70 in a game and has 5x All-Star appearances at 28. That Hawks team as a whole had 3 AS appearances going into the year. They were a lot more about having a deep rotation that let the team stay fresh/fast. 

This year’s Cavs are much more reminiscent of the 05-06 Pistons to me. Ridiculous frontcourt defensively, very strong offensive 1-2 in the backcourt. Limited depth. They don’t have a wing presence like Tayshaun Prince though which puts them a clear notch below that squad imo. || [removed] || Disagree.  Mobley shows flashes of unbelievable things.  Atlanta didn’t have anyone quite like that.  Milsap was food but Mobley is a complete game changer.  Cleveland has much better depth and I think you are underrating Garland.  He has awesome quickness and body control.  He is SGA lite for me but with a better 3 point shot.   That Atlanta team didn’t really have anyone comparable to Mitchell either and I definitely do not put Mitchell on a lower tier than Kyrie, Brown or Murray. || [removed] || One key difference this year is the top five players are largely on troubled teams.  I haven't been too sold on the Cavs title chances since ~95% of all title teams in NBA history had a top five player.  


Jokic, Luka, and Giannis are all on somewhat incomplete teams.  Embiid is probably not a top five player anymore.  That just leaves Tatum as a top player on a good team.

This Cavs team is also somewhat built like the Pistons title teams (pretty much the only exception to the ""have a top five player"" rule), with a deep bench and a lot of all star caliber players with an all NBA caliber player.

So I would not make the Cavs title favorites, but I would put them in contention.  I never really did that with those Hawks teams.  If there was a year that a team without a top five player could win, this would be it. || That seems like a very very bad thing to me? That team, and I believe the Raps one year we LeBronto’d them all people could talk about was the depth. That shit didn’t matter at all cause our starting 5 absolutely cooked them, and the minimal rotations we needed was good enough.

I’d rather liken us to the 2013-14 Spurs, and we’re not there as of today, but as a model. Everyone plays completely unselfish, and we do have star power at several spots with PG (even a potential Manu if Ty can keep pace), PF, and C. And a legitimate superstar closer with Mitchell. That nucleus is surrounded by guys who play right always but also go off sporadically (Dean, Vert, Sam, Strus). 

We don’t want to be the 14-15 Hawks that team was never going anywhere. This is hyperbole (for now) but we have our blossoming versions of Tony, Duncan, Kawhi, Green. That’s the team we want to emulate, Hawks had nothing close to Spida and that’s why they got swept. || As a Cavs fan I’m worried that this take will be proven correct, but it seems like comparing these teams is a bit reductive. There have been teams that have had this model and won. People forget, but the 2014-2015 Warriors were more a collection of good players young players (even though Curry won the MVP thanks to voter fatigue on Lebron). Curry was good that year, but more won on the strength of being the best player on the best team that year (then had a dominant MVP season the next season). The 2004 Detroit Pistons are probably the best analogue for this version of the Cavs (two dominant bigs, two ball dominant guards). The fact is that more teams that win have great regular season are for real than are not. If the Cavs win 55-60 I’d say they are likely a for real contender and likely to be good going forward.

Edit: for what it’s worth, I think the absolute best team to compare this Cavs team to is the 2013-2014 Warriors. There’s no reason to think this team will get worse, but it does feel like this team is a season too early. || The Hawks famously were as balanced as they come. The Cavs are a bit more top heavy. Higher ceiling, lower floor. || Honestly a terrible comparison. The cavs team is much better than that hawks team. No one on the hawks was as good as mitchell. I wouldnt even take anyone over garland this season as well from that hawks team. That hawks team wasnt a contender sure and cavs may not be one either but they are still in different tiers. || [removed] || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || Limited depth? Lmao what? || Prince on this year’s cavs would be crazy. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || That 14-15 Hawk's team didn't have anyone close to Donovan's level either. This Cavs team has way more talent than those Hawks. 

Much better comparisons are the early Warriors and the 00's Pistons in terms of overall talent || Mobley has shown incredible progress in adapting his play to share the floor with another big. My only concern at this point is the fit between Spida and Garland || I think you make valid and defensible points.


I just want to point out I never said Mitchell was on the same tier as Jaylen Brown. I said he isn’t on the same tier as jokic or Doncic. 

I would rather have Jaylen brown and Kyrie in a playoff series than Mobley at this point in their careers. || Mobley scores 67% of his buckets from rolling w garland or put backs 

I don’t think you really saw how good Paul millsap and Horford were at that time.

Garland is closer to Immanuel quickley than SGA || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || I think any team earning the 1 seed and making the ECF is a great season. There is only one champion a season and that’s hard to do. 

Also I don’t think TY is anywhere close or on his way to becoming Ginóbili. Ginobili finished games and is a hall of famer.

I think Jared is great but I don’t think he is a definite top 10 center. You can make an argument though  for him to be there || Agree take is pretty reductive. I think they are a great team and contenders. You make great points and comparisons. 

I don’t think Donovan Mitchell current season is close to Stephen Curry’s MVP season. There might have been Lebron Fatigue but Curry had a top 3 season that year at least. I wouldn’t say the same for Donovan. 

Also again I consider them contenders, They just wouldn’t be in my top 4 playoff teams for who had the greatest chance of winning the title. || Yeah chauncy pistons better comparison. 

Though I would take prime Al horford over anyone except Mitchell. || [removed] || I don’t like their depth in a postseason setting. The Cavs’ strongest lineups include their 4 key starters, and then there’s an opening at the 3. 

I only think Levert/Okoro are playoff options at that spot. Jerome/Merrill are too small and Wade/Niang too slow. They can probably get limited minutes at the 2 or 4 respectively but I think those will necessitate Cleveland to stagger their backcourt and frontcourt pairings. 

In the playoffs I think that’s pretty suboptimal for a team with limited star power, you don’t want to have to weaken your lineups to accommodate role players. You want your best lineups out there as often as possible and for the role players to fit interchangeably into them. || Exactly. Nobody was saying Steph was a superstar until suddenly they won 60+ games and a ring. That could be the Cavs this year or next year.  || I'm not worried about that at all honestly especially with how Kenny staggers his rotations. They both get plenty of time as the lead ball handler and they're both capable and willing off ball players and cutters. There's been quite a few moments this year where Mitchell will straight up tell Garland to run the offense and defer to him, he's done a great job adapting his mentality and game to the situation as it changes || get your brain checked buddy || On the Ty thing, definitely not Manu was an all timer. I’m just saying I’d hope our layout to be more like them than the Hawks lol. If it ever were to happen we’re in the infant stages of building it. I just don’t think the Hawks is a great thing (referring to your title). We’d better hope it’s more a Spurs type team or this team we’ll just fall short every year. Even Boston might be a better comp, they’re deep but they have 2 killers which we might end up with (Spida and DG or Mobley). || Can you name the top 10 centers in the league then?"
Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2024-12-27,nbadiscussion,1hogf1q,Mock Early All-Star Rosters,"I was thinking today about how stacked the league is in terms of individual talent, and how there will be quite a few guys getting snubbed from the all-star rosters this year.

I tried to put together some early rosters based on my opinions and my estimates of how voting will go. I'll also include some notable snubs.

East:

G: **Jalen Brunson** - Bonafide superstar after last year with the New York market to back him up.

G: **Donovan Mitchell**- Best offensive player/most marketable player on a team on pace for 70+ wins.

F: **Jayson Tatum** - Known commodity having an excellent season

F: **Giannis Antetokounmpo** - Superstar arguably having his best individual season, likely best player in the east, leads the league in scoring and Bucks are hot.

C: **Karl Anthony-Towns** - With Embiid being in and out of the lineup KAT is likely the best center in the east, and he's been playing amazing as he meshes into new surroundings. Also has the New York Market.

B1: **Damian Lillard** - Popular vet having a great season.

B2: **Jaylen Brown** - Last year's Finals MVP who will lose his shit if he gets snubbed again after the Olympics.

B3: **Trae Young** - Trae is back to proper All-Star form after a few down years missing the weekend.

B4: **Evan Mobley** - Young big who has made the leap into a versatile legit weapon on both ends.

B5: **LaMelo Ball** - Honestly I'm not too sure about this one, he's averaging thirty but he is typically made out of glass so I think it will depend on how many games he plays in the coming weeks.

B6: **Cade Cunningham** - Young budding star with great counting stats and who's impressive maturity has helped turn Detroit around immensely.

B7: **Darius Garland** Great player on a team that I think deserves to get three guys into the game.

**EASTERN SNUBS** (in no particular order)

Mikal Bridges, 
OG Anunoby,

I'd probably put Tyrese Maxey, Derrick White, RJ Barrett, Jarrett Allen, Jalen Johnson and Tyler Herro first up for injury reserves.

**WEST:**

G: **Shai-Gilgeous Alexander** - On here for obvious reasons

G: **Luka Doncic** - See above

F: **LeBron James** - Ah, this is a tricky one. Obviously fucking LeBron James will be an all-star game starter. And is he an all-star caliber player? Yes. Does every all-star caliber player get to be in the all-star game in the year 2024? No. Does LeBron objectively deserve to be an all-star starter this year? Probably not.

F: **Victor Wembanyama** - Everyone knew it was only a matter of time before this guy was at the very top of the league in terms of production, and here we are.

F: **Nikola Jokic** - An absurd basketball player

B1: **Anthony Davis** - The Lakers have a lot of problems, and Anthony Davis is only one of them sometimes. One of the biggest names in the league, he will be in the All-Star game.

B2: **Anthony Edwards** - Edwards has had a... weird season thus far. He has all but abandoned his athletic interior game to chick up threes on ridiculous efficiency. But is that what the Wolves need from him? Probably not. He will also be in the All-Star game.

B3: **Jaren Jackson Jr** - The Memphis Grizzlies are second in the West, so naturally I hear nothing about them ever. I was surprised to see that Jackson Jr. is their leading scorer. Maybe a Memphis fan can explain their success despite Ja and Bane having down years statistically. (Especially Bane, wtf is happening there?)

B4: **Kevin Durant** - Kevin Durant will be in the NBA All-Star game

B5: **Stephen Curry** - I honestly don't believe Curry deserves a spot this year, but see my entries for KD and Bron for an explanation.

B6: **Alperen Sengun** - Sengun is probably having a worse individual year than last year when at time she was heralded as the second coming of Jokic, but the Rockets have shot right to the top of the West this year and need a guy in the big game. I figure it should be Sengun, but again I literally never hear anything about the Rockets outside of Reddit and am not totally sure who their main guy is considering it seems that they have pretty consistent production across the roster and their top scorer Jalen Green is still the proto-type of AAU ball.

B7: **Kyrie Irving** - The last spot in the West was a tough decision. I gave it to Kyrie because he is having a great year, the Mavs are near the top of the West, he's coming off of a high publicity playoff run, and he is a known commodity in the league.

If you read this far congratulations. This has been a nice way to spend an hour. Let me know what your thoughts are.",96,60,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hogf1q/mock_early_allstar_rosters/,2024-12-28 16:57:33,"I'm really nibbling at the edges here, but snubs implies that they're having a great season and maybe only barely miss out on a spot. It doesn't mean a known good player who's scoring 20 a game or some prior All-Star. Maybe they're honorable mentions or sub All-Stars (a concept from Thinking Basketball), but they're not snubs.


For instance, I find it difficult to believe that the Pelicans get 4 players in the snub category with the worst record in the West. Green, Randle, and Gobert (as much as I liked his contributions with us) are not snubs either. 


Similar for the East. || Anthony Edwards is shooting 3s this season because the starting line up has Gobert, McDaniels, and Randle who all do not give him spacing to play an interior game. || I really agree with these. It's hard to get new blood in the game with all the legacy/ large market picks but that's just part of it for now. 

As a Grizzlies fan, Bane had an oblique injury early in the season and he just now seems to be shaking the rust off. Combine that with playing fewer minutes by design with a deep bench and his numbers are down. I'm not concerned. || I can explain the Memphis situation. JJJ massively improved when he was the only one healthy last season playing with literal G league players as his starting teammates. Ja keeps getting hurt every three games so he has missed a lot and is trying to focus on assisting more. Bane got an injury early season and is just now getting back to form. He was pretty bad for a while though. The Grizzlies are doing so well because during the offseason they fired almost all of the assistant coaches and brought in a ton of new ones. The new offense is all about sharing the ball and playing with the fastest pace in the NBA. Most games even the starters play under 30min because the philosophy is to always have fresh guys in the game. So far the Grizzlies have the best bench in the league and that’s why they keep winning even though Ja and Bane haven’t been at their best. Also drafting two rookies who are top 5 helps. Oh yeah and GG and Vince still haven’t even played yet. (Vince played two games but I’m not counting that.) || If you think Curry doesn’t deserve an Allstar nod this year, I will agree on that. But Allstar game is in San Francisco, his home turf. Plus, he is like top 2 in terms of popularity so I think he will still be an Allstar even though he is regressing. || Jalen Williams has to be in there, OKC are miles ahead in the West and deserve at least 2 All-Stars (and if Chet wasn't injured you could even make a case for 3 All-stars) || I think your East is probably close to what it will be (some of it is easy to predict – the East starters are already pretty much locked up). However, I think it will Herro instead of LaMelo. Coaches reward winning with the reserves. Heat are sixth right now, Hornets thirteenth. Heat will have someone. Bam is having a down year and there’s no way coaches reward Jimmy for whatever is going on with him. And Herro has been great. He’s having a crazy efficient year and has been good enough to deserve it. || I think your east lineup is great. I think Herro might sneak in, but that’s it. 

In the west, I think Harden should be an absolute lock, but because of politics he might miss it. He’s better than Sengun and Kai. Imo Sabonis, Fox, and maybe Book and JDub have also been better than those two. || Harden deserves it. I don’t think Dallas should have 2 all stars. Luka might miss it depending on the severity of his injury. 

As for the East, I don’t think Cleveland will get 3 all stars. I think Hali or Maxey gets in instead of Garland. || Sengun inclusion by a non biased Rockets fan is great to see. His game isn’t as flashy because of the Udokas system, but he’s way more effective overall which has contributed to team success. || Nice breakdown…pretty darn accurate…definitely hope Melo plays the rest of the games till ASG…he’s a joy to watch, makes me chuckle how much fun he’s having 🕊 || Agree with all except for Kyrie, I think JDub and Harden deserve it more than he does rn given that the league normally awards the top teams two all stars like last year with KAT and Ant and that a surprising team like the Clips would normally have an all star especially one thats a house hold name. 

Though I do not hate the selection and understand your reasoning for that || Focused mostly on your East lineup as I’m a Sixers homer. 

Lamelo entertaining AF and has played 22 games, def would keep him in.

I take the all star as popularity / the current season. So don’t care that Brown was finals MVP or would be upset, he’s on outside of the fence for me 

Josh hart as a snub what? 

I’d get Maxey in the mix - otherwise generally like the work (once again, am homer) || LaMelo is not an All-Star!! His team is 7-24. This is the Bradley Beal 2020 situation. 30 PPG on a bottom feeder on bad efficiency is not All-Star worthy. Also noteworthy that Beal shot 45% from the field and LaMelo is shooting 42%. Empty stats. || I agree on all of the above. My heart tells me that Lebron and Durant should be swapped, but I know that is unlikely.

Doesn't mean I won't keep voting for Tyrese and Pascal but after the start we had... Siakam has an argument but it is unlikely. || I will be shocked if Sengun makes the all-star game

He should behind Jalen Williams, Harden, Fox definitely and then probably behind Nooker, Morant and Powell || I would take Trae over Brunson for the first five this year. He is doing great as a playmaker with that young players around him. || Definite agree on curry arguably not deserving it, might put KD over Vic in the starters just due to fan vote and bc he’s still been very good this year || [removed] || [removed] || I’m glad you asked caused I dropped a video 2 weeks ago, a few minor tweaks 

https://youtu.be/MyZcJWoxE_k || Nice list, what shocked me the most is that Jaren Jackson is the leading scorer not Ja Morant! || He won't make it because of the injury, but Cam Thomas at least deserves a mention. || Its pretty crazy how many people don’t realize all star reserves aren’t selected by fan vote || yeah i definitely was rough around the edges with the snubs. forgot to mention i had a low bar for that. to be fair i literally added those three guys right before i posted lol just as an add-on || i will also say that despite narratives and team success, check out randle's shooting splits when you get the chance. his scoring his slightly down but it's not like he some bum already. || Him “chucking up” threes is literally what the wolves need from him lol || What was wrong with the Grizzlies assistant coaches? || Spot on, but I think a lot of Ja's games missed to injury are precautionary this year. || that is what is frustrating about legacy guys eating up spots. you can assume every year that injury will call for replacements. also swap him and kyrie and you get no argument from me."
Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2025-01-20,nbadiscussion,1i70obp,Team Standing vs. Individual Performance in Regards to MVP,"So there's a lot of discussion about whether Shai or Jokić should be leading for MVP right now and I was thinking about how much winning vs. individual performance not only should matter, but also has mattered for the MVP race.

Jokić is having an all time season, averaging close to a 30 point triple-double which has only been achieved twice before by MVP winners Oscar Robertson and Russel Westbrook. 

Shai is currently leading the Thunder to be on pace for a 70 win season, which has also only been done twice before by teams which were led by MVPs in Micheal Jordan and Stephen Curry. 

The Cavaliers are also on pace for a 70+ win record, but it seems to be pretty much agreed upon that Shai's individual performance outweighs anything anyone on Cleveland is doing right now, so long as their records stay similar. 

So an argument I've been hearing in regards to Jokić is that the Nuggets aren't performing well enough for him to win a real MVP, apparently regardless of his insane performance. This does obviously also have to do with SGA and the Thunder's success this season, but for reference: 

Jokić is currently averaging 30.1-13.2-9.9, and the Nuggets are 4th in the west with a .619 record.

MVP Westbrook averaged 31.6-10.7-10.4, and the Thunder were the 6th seed with a .573 record.

MVP Oscar Robertson averaged 31.4-9.9-11.0, and the Royals were the 2nd seed with a .688 record. There were like 9 teams back then but they still went 55-25 if you're interested.



Now, if Shai does lead the Thunder to 70+ wins and keeps up his performance, it will be pretty hard to argue against his MVP case. Lets say they do wind up falling to 65 wins though, something that has still only been done 21 times. Of those 21 teams to win 65+ games, 15 were lead by MVP winners. The 6 who didn't are as follows:

The 1972 Lakers went 69-13, MVP went to Kareem who averaged 34.8-16.6-4.6 on the 63-19 Bucks 

The 1997 Bulls went 69-13, MVP went to Karl Malone who averaged 27.4-9.9-4.5 on the 64-18 Jazz

The 2008 Celtics went 66-16, MVP went to Kobe who averaged 28.3-6.3-5.4 on the 57-25 Lakers

The 2009 Lakers went 65-17. MVP went to Lebron who averaged  28.4-7.6-7.2 on the 66-16 Cavaliers 

The 2016 Spurs went 67-15, MVP went to Stephen Curry who averaged 30.1-5.4-6.7 on the 73-9 Warriors

The 2017 Warriors went 67-15, MVP went to Russ who averaged 31.6-10.7-10.4 on the 47-35 Thunder



With the 09 Lakers and 16 Spurs, the MVP went to the best player on a team that had an even better record. With the 72 Lakers and 97 Bulls. the MVP went to the best player on a team with a worse record, but that team still had 60+ wins and the player put up an arguably better performance.

The 08 Celtics and 17 Warriors are outliers however because the MVP went to a player on a team that was under 60 wins, despite having 66 and 67 wins respectively. With both of these teams, part of the ""problem"" was that there was no clear best player on their rosters. It was easier to attribute their success to 3 or more players on the team rather than any one players performance, where Kobe and Westbrook during those years were clearly the best players on their team. 

08 is also interesting however because LeBron was statistically a better player than Kobe that year putting up 30.0-7.9-7.2, but his 45-37 record was used against him, meaning that year the award went to neither a player on a historically good team nor the best player stat wise.

  
So depending on how the rest of the season goes it could be one of the most divisive MVPs of all time. There have obviously been other questionable years in the past, but if everything pans out how it has been going (Jokić averages a 30pt triple-double, Thunder AND Cavaliers get 70+ wins,) they could give it to SGA or Jokić and not be wrong, so they'll probably give it to Shai due to ""voter fatigue.""

However there are still a few interesting scenarios: What if the Thunder drop to \~65 wins but the Cavs hit 70+? Would Donovan Mitchell get it for the historic record? What if the Nuggets get the 2nd seed? What if Jokić leads the league in 3+ categories by the end of the season? There are so many ways this award could go depending on if these players/teams can stay the course, I'm interested to hear some other people's input at this point in the season.",22,33,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i70obp/team_standing_vs_individual_performance_in/,2025-01-21 21:38:02,"I think this conversation hit a fever pitch like 10-ish years ago when you had Curry and the Warriors crushing everybody, while Harden was putting up near-nightly triple-doubles every night and almost singlehandedly dragging the Rockets into the 8th-seed.

My view is that, if you're top 5 in at least 2 major categories, you deserve to be in the discussion. Then you factor in team performance. IMO, it's way harder to be the top guy on a stacked team that wins, than the top guy on a team that barely makes the playoffs (even if they would be a basement team without them).

Beyond that, I rarely ever have a problem with who wins MVP because it can be so subjective and they're all deserving at that point. || The difference between this year and previous years, to me, is that it's actually close now. Advanced stats *don't* have Jokic as easily the best player. (BPM does but I think that's because it favors big man assists a lot.) EPM has SGA ahead and bball-index LEBRON has them neck-and-neck. Neil Paine's estimated RAPTOR has them neck-and-neck as well. As far as other comparison points, Jokic's averages are crazy, but so is OKC's team performance, currently on pace for the all-time net rating record. Obviously supporting cast plays a huge role, but without Shai (and assuming Chet is still hurt) it's not a crazy talented lineup? Deep for sure, but would definitely struggle offensively. A Jokic-less Nuggets would struggle way worse but tbf the Nuggets *with* Jokic are well behind OKC too. And his backup is Deandre Jordan which makes the with-or-without-him argument make him look a lot rosier than it is. Anyhow I think either player would deserve it if they keep this up. We can just sit back and enjoy. || It was the same for Luka last season. He did have an all time great season. The team was injured a lot. Once everyone was available, the team also performed very well. And then they made it to the finals.
 
But no MVP for this ridiculous season, because of missing team success. He was third actually. I would be a bit mad if now for Jokic „rules“ were different.  || You are pretty much ignoring the fact fhat SGA is also having an alltime season. || It really depends on if we are debating who we think deserves MVP. Or if we are debating who we think the voters will select.

Shai is leading because voters historically skew towards narrative over contribution. The narrative is that OKC is having an all-time great season, and Shai is the driver of that success. 

The narrative isn't how Jokic is single handedly carrying a weak Nuggets roster with historic performance. Not because he isn't doing that. It's because he's done that for 4 straight seasons, so it's not new or noteworthy. 

It's why the Bball reference tracker, which is based on stats has Jokic at 66% to Shai's 24%. But the betting odds have Shai as a 3-1 favorite to win it. || I think the easy answer for why team success is so heavily valued in NBA Awards voting is that players have a lot more flexibility in their roles that you see in other team sports. 

In baseball, the batter is trying to get hits, the pitcher and defensive players are trying to get outs. It's pretty straightforward. Likewise for football, the offensive players are trying to get yards, first downs, and touchdowns, the defense is trying to stop them. Most of the real ""decisions"" are made on the sidelines.

In basketball, the goal is to accumulate possessions and efficiently turn possessions into points. Rebounding and turnovers get the team X many possessions, which is the currency the offense has to win the game. Every time you take a shot or turn the ball over, you're ""spending"" a possession. Every shot a player takes ""robs"" a teammate of an opportunity to take that shot. Let's say a player scores 50 on 40 shots, making 20 of them. What would have happened if those 20 missed shots were taken by his teammates? It can be pretty hard to know. If a player takes just 10 shots but makes 8 of them, was he passing up opportunities by not shooting and hurting his team that way? 

TL;DR it's very hard to know if players are making the ""right"" choices on a macro level to help their team, and ""well, if the team won, it was probably a good choice"" can be a very helpful thing to fall back on. 

Narrative can play a role too. For example, in 2016-17, KD led the Warriors in most advanced statistical categories, but the team's record went from 73-9 to ""just"" 67-15 after they added him in the offseason. So it felt weird to give the MVP to KD, and he kinda cancelled out 2016 MVP Steph. || I've always thought that while I don't always agree with who wins the MVP, it always goes to someone who deserves it. It was always gonna be a subjective award, so while I think some players on some years deserve it over the eventual winner, you can't really argue that the one who won didn't deserve it that year

Yes, stats matter. Yes, team success matters. Yes, even storyline matters. And criteria for voting is allowed to change every year. That's really just the nature of the award. || I mean some advanced stats have Jokic leading all time for a single season rn, and by a pretty large margin. Idk how you can say advanced stats don't support his MVP case when they are some of the best supporting evidence for it lol there's really only a couple Shai has over Jokic.

Like sure 30.1-13.2-9.9 is impressive, but doing it while also leading all of NBA history in PER and BPM is insane. For reference MVP Westbrook who had a similar stat line is ranked 27th in PER and and 19th in BPM all time. || Luka had a great season last year, I thought he deserved MVP too, but Jokic is just on another level this year. Like I mentioned before the 2017 Warriors won 67 games, but the MVP went to Westbrook who couldn't even hit 50 with the Thunder that year.

Basically the NBA and the voters have set themselves up to contradict themselves no matter who wins this year, and honestly that's probably better for media attention. || 1. Everyone in the MVP race every year is having an all-time great season.

2. Playoff performance has literally zero to do with a regular season award, mentioning it at all is just trying to prop up a weaker argument.

3. Why are you assuming that 'missing team success' was the sole reason for Luka not receiving the award? Perhaps some voters thought that Jokic simply had the more valuable season? ||  It  was more than lack of team success. He missed 12 games compared to 3 for Jokic and per game stats for Jokic at least matched him. Jokic had fewer points but with more rebounds, better shooting efficiency, and fewer turnovers. || I don't agree with this statement, can you make your case for it to me?  A great season?  An MVP season?  Sure.  But all-time? || Yeah it's not really the same. All time for Shai maybe lol, but in regards to whats been done before it's just really good. If SGA and Jokic were putting up the same numbers they are today but the Thunder wasn't doing as well it'd be way less of a debate. SGAs 31-5-6 is great, but it doesnt hold a candle to Jokic putting up 30-13-10 on incredible efficiency. When I say all time I mean this season by Jokic is potentially a top 10 season by any player ever. SGA is not doing that this year, he's only in the conversation with Jokic because he's leading his TEAM to a historic all time season. || Well Luka had great stats and was dragging a bad Mavs team last year but winning less than the Nuggets was the main factor in losing it. 

I would say the gap this year in winning is even further than that. Thunder on pace to win 70 games is insane. It's too much winning. Too much! || PER is a pretty rudimentary advanced stat, and as i said, BPM weights big man assists higher than guard assists which is why i think it's misleading in Jokic's case. Also Shai right now is 9th all-time for BPM (22nd in PER) so he's not even trailing by that much anyway. EPM, LEBRON, and estimated RAPTOR are some of the most advanced all-in-one stats which is why i favor them over PER and BPM. || Those rebounds are pretty but he plays 35 mpg at center. How many rebounds does an avg C get in 35 minutes? It's really more superfluous than an actually impactful statistic - the points and assists are great but he's probably not far above average as a defender at his position. That's why you should look at all the advanced stats beyond just PER.

Meanwhile Shai is leading the league in points and is about 12th on the DPOY ladder while playing on a team with a likely unprecedented net rating in this era of basketball. I mean, maybe GSW did it in their hey day, but Shai is the man behind the madness like Curry was for GSW. || I guess then I just disagree with you. In my opinion, Luka did not just have a „great“ season. I know people don’t like counting stats. But his were the best ever, or in a really long time. 

Similar to how Jokic is perhaps in a different league, Luka was last year. But Jokic won. Jokic has gotten enough praise.  || You gotta admit generally when Luka was brought up in MVP discussions for last season it was always as third place because Jokic and Shai were tied for the first seed and the Mavs were a fifth seed so the easy differentiator was “Well Luka doesnt have enough team success” || 1. Jokic did not have an all time season last year, but Luka had.
2. I mentioned this to show that the Mavs were not as weak as the standings said and were injury ridden. It was not meant as an argument for MVP.
3. I am not assuming this, was literally all over the media last season in all ranking discussions for MVPs. I am not assuming anything  or making stuff up here. It was super clear Luka would be Nr.1, but all sites and voters argued the team record is too bad. Many have also discussed that Jokic got it because he was snubbed the year before for Embiid. Are you saying Jokic had a an individually better season than Luka? And SGA too?!? || The offensive load on him is incredible for a non-point guard player. They gave him one dimensional shooters + rim running center + JDub and asked him to get a top 10 offense. There's no real point guard on the roster. Cason Wallace is pretty much a 3-D guard closer to Keon Ellis than a real point guard who can make decisions with the ball in his hands. 

People also have to realize JDub is amazing because of the 2 way potential, but the offense is not amazing or anything. You can still very easily shut him down. He's not yet a great playmaker. He picks up his dribble too much in the paint. He's not athletic enough to just blow by guys. He's shooting 34% from 3 point range this season. There's plenty of games where he just can't perform when the defense focuses in on him. 

Basically SGA does everything for them on offense, while being a top 25 defender in the NBA this season. I can't stress how flawed the OKC roster is on offense. They have 2 guys in total on the roster who can attack a mismatch. They have only 3 guys in total who can pass and dribble with the ball in their hands (SGA, JDub, Caruso) and one of them (Caruso) can't attack a mismatch. || Defense exists.

Jokic is essentially disqualified from having top 10 all time overall seasons with his dreadful defense at his position. || [deleted] || Let me ask you this, to get away from SGA for a second because you brought up something really interesting - how do you feel about OKC's chances for a deep playoff run this year with a flawed offensive roster?  Do you think it will sink them?  Or do you feel this might be an '03 Pistons-type team? || People on this sub read stats not watch games. They'll give you 500 advanced stats to try tell you Jokic is a decent defender like your eyes don't work || Braindead take, Jokic is 4th in steals, 4th in defensive rebounds, and only 6th in defensive rating for centers. Still top 10 in DRB% as well as TRB%, and Jokic is actually 2nd in DBPM behind Shai right now.

On top of that, Jokic literally has the highest single season box plus/minus AND player efficiency rating OF ALL TIME at the moment, to say his fairly decent defense disqualifies him from MVP given these other stats is crazy bias. 

I know you can't always depend on stats to be an accurate representation of what really happens on the court, but when he's in the top ranks of so many different defensive categories ""big man plays bad d, disqualified"" doesn't really hold up. || lmao seriously-- Jokic *obviously* had the best season last year

A strong case could be made that Luka had a better individual season than *Shai* last year but got 3rd because of the team success differential... but Jokic very clearly had the best year || Ugh, I really detest this style of commentary.

There's no argument presented or attempt to deconstruct the other commenter's argument.  It's just a short, thoughtless attack on the commenter with no real response to the content of the comment itself.  Even the (lame, pointless) claim that the other commenter is biased goes unsupported by evidence.

Having a discussion means being willing to engage with what others have to say.  That's not always easy, especially when we realize our original argument wasn't as strong as it might have initially felt.  But one of the values of discussion is that, via exposure to ideas that are unfamiliar or uncomfortable, we might learn something new or have our view changed.  Attacking the person not the argument prevents that.

My hope is that this subreddit can be preserved as a space for discussion, not shitposting. || The offensive flaws are mitigated when Chet comes back- you don't need to work as hard to break down defenses anymore because of the better spacing. 

But you can still see where this team can get shut down offensively- and JDub is the swing piece. Against teams like the Nuggets and Clippers in the playoffs there's gonna be games where JDub doesn't have the juice to get it going. As the 2nd option he's on 55.5TS% right now and it's getting close to chucking here. His length almost works against him because he's not super vertically athletic or explosive. His game is all about muscling and methodical craftiness to get his shot off. But guys like Aaron Gordon, PJ Washington, Kawhi, he's gonna have a lot of problems because they're all stronger and longer than him. In the playoffs he's gonna have to rely on his midrange/3 point shooting a lot more because the lanes are gonna close up on him. If he could actually draw fouls this would be less of a problem but he can't at this point. 

Anyways, even with JDubs weaknesses I still see them getting to the conference finals. Their defense is 4.5 points better than the 2nd place team which is crazy. But in the later rounds when they go up against better teams their ball handling and half court creation ability will get attacked. Like I mentioned the Clippers are a really bad matchup for them I think. 

They're neck and neck with Boston only because Boston is coasting a bit more than last year and Boston is underperforming from a 3 point shooting perspective. 

But if this was last years Boston vs this year OKC I would give it to Boston in 6 games. || I had one of them tell me Jokic could win dpoy if he focused on it a few days back... || None of these are valid defensive stats. DBPM is quite literally broken."
Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2025-01-20,nbadiscussion,1i6jo8a,Minnesota Game Notes From MLK Weekend,"This team ""could"" be built to play their best basketball in April, May, and June.

I received a lot of positive feedback about posting my notes from the games I watched in preparation for my guest-hosting gig on the All-NBA podcast with Tim Legler. [Here are the notes from those games.](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/the-tim-legler-podcast-that-never)

I’m sharing notes from three games again but keeping one team the same: Minnesota.

Thanks for reading Low Man Help! 

* MIN vs. NYK
* MIN vs. CLE
* MIN vs. MEM

That’s three games in four nights, which is a good snapshot of the team. All three opponents are high-quality and present unique challenges.

MIN went 1-2 in these games. They are working through a new roster and could be a dangerous team in April. But, if they don't get it together, they could become wasted potential.

**Three macro things stood out to me on this three-game set:**

1. Rob Dillingham’s development.
2. Julius Randle’s playmaking opportunity.
3. Anthony Edward’s PnR reads—Process vs. Result mindset.

I was drawn to Dillingham during these three games, especially in the PnR. He’s a key piece in the MIN puzzle. They don’t have a lot of bites at the PD apple, and he’s a top-10 pick that they gave up a lot to get. His development matters a lot to their calculus.

**Dillingham’s PnR before the three-game stretch:**

* Per 100: 43 - He’s getting the film.
* PPD: 0.921 - He’s getting in the right spots; the process reads can improve.

**Dillingham’s PnR after the three-game stretch:**

* Per 100: 43.6
* PPD: 1.047 - He showed that his speed and creativity can present a unique element in this action.

Another big-picture takeaway was how vital Randle’s playmaking is for this team. JR and MIN should increasingly embrace it to be the best team they can be. I don’t know if he enjoys it more than scoring, but I believe it’s his elite skill and the one that MIN needs him to do the most.

Randle has the size and skill to create [cracked shells and rotations](https://lowmanhelp.substack.com/p/the-blueprint-cracking-the-shell?r=2wmouo) against almost any defender he faces. Cover him with a guard, and he can bully in the post till you send a double. Cover him with a big, and he can get into the paint via dribble to draw a second defender. Put him in a two-man action with Edwards, and he gets to play advantage basketball from the pocket.

**Randle’s Playmaking Stats:**

4.5 Assist (Need more here as the season ticks on)

3.0 TOs

The optionality and playmaking of Randle & Dillingham are two of the most significant swing factors for this team.

Finally, the Rudy-Edwards dynamic is weird. Edwards does not like to give Rudy the ball in the pocket every time in blitzed two-man actions. I think Rudy needs as many reps as he can get in pocket playmaking situations, but even that feels weird to say out loud, given that Rudy is in his 12th year in the league.

\^\^ Edwards openly gets frustrated with Rudy during games. I am not sure that’s great for the situation—something to monitor.

# MIN/NYK:

MIN—Off the bat, OReb kicked out three. There is NO better time to shoot the ball. I think it’s because we grow up catching passes from a rebounder under the basket, so it’s the most natural motion. Who knows.

MIN—Randle + Edwards DHO game could be a game changer when teams go to blitz AE.

MIN only runs 3.9 per 100 and scores 1.095, but this action would be gold for them with Randle and Reid's ball-handling ability. It would also allow AE to set up backdoor cuts and play 3v2 downhill—scary.

Handoff Combo (pre-MEM game)

**Randle + Edwards:**

* Per 100: 3.9
* PPD: 1.095

**Reid + Edwards:**

* Per 100: 2.6
* PPD: 1.292

MIN—Not many players in the NBA are better at reading Drop coverage than Conley. The floater is such a weapon when “breaking” the big in the drop. Here’s a breakdown of MC “breaking” PnR bigs from last year's DEN series.

NYK—Brunson’s floater is up there with MC and he’s pretty good at “Breaking” bigs in the PnR. He’s such a fun watch. What a start for JB here, where would NYK be without him?

NYK—Bridges driving closeouts looks good, back to back catch & shoot threes generated. NYK needs more shot creation for from guys not named JB.

* OG misses corner drift WIMS read on first drive, turns into a ATB three instead of corner one.
* JB makes an awesome 2nd window WIMS reads for a catch & shoot three.

MIN—Good creativity and read from Dillingham in first PnR with Reid - got to use the left hand on the left side. Guys are too athletic in this league, can’t give that angle back.

MIN—AE step back 3… If Rudy is under the rim, has a cross-match, and you can see both of his numbers, you must give him a touch. Got to have some EQ there.

MIN—Dillingham’s speed is an outlier. Opened up a Reid 3 PM in a PnR action and then a lob to Rudy on an empty corner PnR. He looks like he’s got a chance to be a guy that can blow a game open every few nights.

MIN—The other side of the floor is a more significant learning curve for Dillingham. Back to back threes from Payne during his PnR coverage. I know it’s a drop with Rudy, but I would love to see how he evolves with getting skinny or not dying as much on the screen.

\^ Just gambled for a steal on a switch and gave up another Payne 3. No bueno.

NYK—CAM PAYNE is making it RAIN!! He just broke off a play to get a SB3 up, lol. I can’t fault him for wanting the heat check there, but Hart didn’t like it.

MIN—Dillingham gets a TO on a lob to Rudy by not making Sims “break” his 2v1 coverage in the drop. I’m excited to see where RD is at by the end of the year in reading 2v1 actions in PnR Drop coverage.

Three Dillingham PnRs from 1st half: Missed lefty opp and one good “breaking” read + one poor “breaking” read — I’m willing to bet he figures the NBA PnR out with reps.

NYK—Bridges & Hart’s defenders sitting slightly deeper in the gaps—court compressed. Without JB on the court, it’s difficult for them to generate good stuff consistently. Maybe it’s just this stretch.

**Bridges & Hart without JB According to CLG:**

* \+15.2 with Towns (507 poss)
* \+16.5 without towns (102 poss)

MIN—Reid feels like a cheat code. Man, that guy is talented offensively.

\^ How long will he be amenable to coming off the bench?

NYK—They refuse to switch JB onto a good guard in PnR actions. AE just burned them two plays in a row for 5 points. AE gets the switch right before the half and goes drag → SB3 on JB.

NYK—Bridges keeps shooting. I respect the hell out of that guy. The worst thing is going 0-1 while turning down nine open looks. I love that he’s willing to go 0-10.

MIN—There are just a few missed single reads from AE every game that feel forced. He’s so talented that he thinks he can score in any situation (he might be able to). But there are times when hitting a single would do wonders for him/MIN; this is one of them. Open corner 3 or swing swing to MC 3 if JB makes the help the helper closeout.

NYK—1st poss of the 2nd half JB off-ball screen action. NYK has to find ways (like this) to get him time off the ball to attack from an advantage. It's too much of a load to handle and score as much as they need him to—similar to Cade in DET without Ivey.

MIN—AE -> Rudy in the pocket | Rudy -> McDaniels in the corner | McDaniels advantage attack to a middy. You have to get Rudy these reps in the pocket now; they'll need to be able to play this card in May.

MIN—AE and JR have with two TOs on backside defenders stealing passes in the span of five possessions. Too casual.

NYK—What will they do when they get to the PO, and all teams do is spam JB’s man as the screener in every PnR action? It looks exhausting trying to keep him from switching.

AE had his way in these actions throughout the game. NYK gave up a Beasley 3 to lose vs. DET on a PnR where they didn’t want to switch JB onto Cade.

NYK—Must play fast without JB on the floor. Hart is easily a top 5 transition player in the NBA. He's so creative in the open court.

MIN—AE “breaking” Sims for a PnR lob to Rudy, I love that! AE can be the best player in the world if he falls in love with the process of hitting singles. The talent is otherworldly; he would grind teams down.

# MIN/CLE:

MIN—First play… geez. AE gives up layup to DM going UNDER a DHO. If you go under the action, you can NOT give up a straight-line drive at the rim. Bad tone setter here from AE.

MIN—Help UP the lane dunk for Rudy on an MC advantage drive. I imagine this is what they looked like when MC got traded to MIN.

CLE—Garland is so good at reading whether Rudy is “breaking” in the 2v1 Drop. I could watch him play PnR basketball all day. He’s the best teaching tape out there for young guards. I would 100% use it for Rob Dillingham. They are both undersized and have to be crisp and creative with the reads.

MIN—JR’s shooting is a significant swing factor for this team. It feels like he is turning down a lot of looks that Towns feasted off in two-man games with AE and MC. He’s had one outlier season as a shooter; otherwise, it’s low 30s.

\^\^ My eyes say the shot is not linked together and I would not bet on him shooting 40% on volume again with these current form.

MIN—Great LMH AE read and swing swing 3. This is the NYK play before halftime from last night. This is one of those singles that have to be hit every time and live with the results because it’s great process.

AE has made three of these early LMH reads → Corner passes this game. It’s nice to see him do the simple. Each one has resulted in a GREAT shot for MIN.

CLE—There is such a big difference in the quality of three-point looks they’re getting up tonight compared to the OKC game. Their dribble penetration looks so much better. OKC is so good at keeping the ball out of the paint.

MIN—FINALLY they get the ball to the middle of the zone (Reid) after five empty trips, and no one gets into the soft spot. The zone is giving MIN fits a good change-up pitch from KA.

MIN—How talented is Reid?! Off the bounce 3, soft spot of the zone euro floater, and running two-man game into a help up the lane lob to Rudy. All in the span of a few minutes.

MIN—NAW, great story of self-awareness. There was a real chance he was going to end up out of the league after NOP. His shift from “I can be the man” to “How can I amplify the man” will make him generational wealth. So awesome to see.

MIN—AE DHO with JR into an early LMH read and wide open Reid 3…. I love the process here. More singles like this from AE is a big deal, make or miss.

MIN—McDaniels & Randle do not give me much confidence as a shooter. Their kinetic linking isn’t good. It opens the door for mental blocks when they hit a stretch of the misses.

MIN—Rudy in the pocket → Help UP the lane → McDaniels in the dunker. Keep getting Rudy the reps!!

CLE—Graland and Mitchell are cooking this Drop coverage. What a two-headed monster those guys are in the backcourt. Play too deep, three ball. Get up to the level; pocket pass to 3v2. Help too much with LMH, skip pass for 3. These dudes are lights out against Drop.

**Garland & Mitchell vs. MIN:**

* 40 Direct PnR
* 60 Points

\^\^ Rudy’s DROP Coverage in PO—I feel like MIN matches up well with OKC and poorly with DAL because of this specific coverage. Luka can shred this coverage shooting from deep. SGA can cook it, too, but he won’t break you from the three-point line like Luka can.

MIN—I love it when Randle does the dirty work; he is all over the O glass. He’s so strong and can create chaos when physically engaged at a high level.

MIN—I do not understand how MIN forgets to get the ball to the soft spot in the center of the zone. Every time they get a touch there, it turns into good looks, but they forget and let CLE off the hook by passing around the perimeter multiple times in a row.

**MIN vs. CLE Zone:**

* 20 Poss
* 16.6 Avg. Poss Length
* 0.700 PPP

MIN—Dillingham PnRs in 4th. At his size, he’s got to be so crisp in the process and relentless in attacking.

* Allen in a switch and gives it up, no bueno. Keep it or boomerang here; get some penetration. SGA was merciless on these switches a few nights ago.
* Jerome UNDER on the next one and keeps going (he shot this one vs NYK).

CLE—Hunting Dillingham with Garland or Mitchell to salt this game away. These are good reps for RD but he’s got to figure out how he can put more resistance on guys at his size.

# MIN/MEM:

MIN—First play… geez. AE dies on a screen and gives up a WIDE OPEN Bane three. gap it or lock and get on the back hip and L&T. I know it's much easier to say, but back-to-back games with bad tone-setters from AE.

MIN—Randle Handoff game opening up things for AE. I really like where this action could go; so much optionality, and if blitzed, then Randle 4v3 is the best option for MIN.

MEM—Morant, man that dude is special finishing around the rim. Lefty one-hand pickup, wow!

MIN—Another backside TO to JR, this time from MC. All of them are in the 20ft area. I wonder if it’s a spacing thing with the bodies covering up where help defenders are located. Out at the 3-point line, you would see the backside defender; in the post, they wouldn’t be low enough.

MEM—It's not Morant-only, but the rip-through foul grifting is out of control again. Ty Jerome, Brunson, Morant, and Edwards. I’ve seen so much rip-through grifting over the past three games.

MIN—JR is creating a lot of good offensive looks as a playmaker. He can generate quality actions when he’s in the open-court playmaking.

MIN—AE PnR Single Reads. 2nd Half THREAD.

He’s one of the best players on earth. I really think he can be the best player in any series if he leans into hitting singles and trusting teammates more. He does it sometimes, and I believe consistently doing it would begin to empower his teammates and elevate them/him. Teammates feel when the best player trusts/believes in them (Jokic does this), and it helps; god, does it help them become more.

**Process vs. Results:** Too many times it feels like AE is swayed by the results of the previous play. AE has another leap in his game (scary) and it will come when he is no longer controlled by the results and falls in love with the process.

* PnR 1 (Level → Blitz/Switch) Opportunity to get JR in a 2v1 playmaking opportunity. AE takes a forced shot off a spin move.
* PnR 2: (Level → Blitz) Finds Rudy in the pocket early enough that Rudy can get his head around and read LMH. MIN gets WIDE OPEN 3 from Advantage Basketball created by AE.
* PnR 3: (Level → Blitz) Finds Rudy in the pocket again; the screen is lower, and space is tighter for Rudy. Rudy reads LMH and sees help UP the lane but makes too hot of a pass to handle for NAW.
* PnR 4: (Level → Blitz) Doesn’t hit Rudy in Pocket. He gets the corner on JJJ and forces the action. AE gets a foul, but it’s a bad process, and it’s a 50/50 foul. These are the plays where the previous result (not process) shapes AE’s process.
* PnR 5: (Level → Blitz/Switch) Gets the corner on SA and creates a cracked shell. AE can make this type of difficult finish, but there is a wide-open catch & shoot 3 from a really good shooter whose man has switched onto him. I believe he sees Wells here, so he knows it’s not a Veer switch.
* PnR 6: (Level → Blitz) Finds JR in the pocket early, and it leads to an open catch & shoot 3 for a really good shooter. Love the process here and trusting teammates at the end of a game. JR can thrive as a 4v3 playmaker in this type of two-man setting with AE when teams blitz.

PnR 4 & 5 are the ones where his results drive the process. I think his game makes the leap when he falls in love with the process and empowering his teammates.

*Side note—No AE bounce passes to Rudy. It is much harder for bigs to catch a non-bounce pass and then make good pocket decisions. MC gets Rudy bounce passes in the pocket more frequently, which helps his playmaking.*

MIN—AE off-ball actions in this game seem to be greater than the previous two; I really like that. Makes the on-ball action scary at the end of the game because you don’t have as much of a rhythm seeing it.

MIN—Dillingham PnR reads keep getting better. I really think the reps are helping so much and you can feel his teammates empowering him to take them. Feels like his teammates understand how much chaos his speed can cause.

* Pull up 3 vs. Drop—Love it! At his size, he’s got to be a process monster and be able to hit every shot in the book in the PnR. I think he has the talent to do it, the shot needs to be linked together a bit more to be a consistent shooter from above the break.
* Back to back plays where the nail help just stunts at RD. The first time he gives it up, and the second time, he keeps and gets a layup. Really like to see him learning on the fly.

\^\^ Big RD stretch in the 4th.

MEM—Morant is special going downhill. The fact that you can still go UNDER on any PnR actions with him and live with the results makes me feel like he can’t take the step of consistently being the best player in a series during the PO.

MIN—AE and NR gave up 4 points in the second half saving the ball underneath their basket. Little things like that kill you in close games.

MIN—JR is the guy who has to play make in the pocket when AE gets blitzed at the end of games. Created two WIDE open threes. Randle, in ”playmaker” mode, takes this team to another level.",39,12,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i6jo8a/minnesota_game_notes_from_mlk_weekend/,2025-01-21 09:23:33,"These notes are accompanied by a substantial number of film edits.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || Great read, thanks!

Love seeing NAW get a shoutout. He’s come so far last 3-4 years. Keeps adding to his game. I thought this particular 3 game stretch was one of his weaker ones of the year, which isn’t a knock, he’s been incredibly consistent. Can’t wait to see if he translates in the playoffs this year, last year was too big of a stage but his confidence & bag keeps growing.

Thoughts on starting Naz over Julius?  Naz allows Rudy to be much more of a rover (Rudy is just average as a man defender IMO). Randle has had a nice season and is great when things are going well and he looks pass first but when he ducks his head its game over for the offense, see both memphis games for examples of top of my head.  Feel like Naz’s instant decision making leads to better offense vs Julius’s slow slow slow ball stopping.  Though Julius can be nice when hes passing (ie Cavs game).

Really really excited for Dillingam’s growth. He needs time to mature but the stage isnt too big for him.  They might have a pretty good offensive player here. || The Wolves are okay, they'll probably perform better in the playoffs just because Ant is a demon there and for whatever reason he just makes like 45% of his midrange shots. But they still arent a good team or particularly well constructed.

Dillingham is insane. || Great job.  Going to cross post this in in r/timberwolves.

Minnesota prefers dribble drive paint touches vs. passing to person in the paint.  So their main actions don't typically apply well to get to the soft spot of the zone.It is a point of frustration with me as well. || A lot to unpack here. First off, you're welcome. Thanks for reading it.

NAW, I love it when players figure out who they are in the league and how they can fit in. Every one of these guys has always been the best player on any team they’ve played on before making it to the NBA; having the self-awareness to know and accept that this has changed is a hard step for a player to grasp. So my hat goes off to him for that.

NAW in the PO. I hope it goes well for him (a big bag is coming if so). It will be all about simplification of his game. Take open threes, drive closeouts if run off the line, and make good decisions on early help = pass or not enough help = finish. Basketball is simple, but that doesn't mean it's easy to do at this speed.

Reid vs. Randle. I don't know. I love NR, but JR has the playmaking that this team desperately needs in a PnR partnership with AE to be a high-level team. They both will play a lot in a PO setting, so not so much of a big deal here, but they do have to figure out if NR is the long-term starter. 

Dillingham is a big swing piece. He's talented, that's for sure. I bet TC sees some miniature Will Barton in him. I think getting him the reps now in the PnR is critical (it feels like they are) because his speed can create chaos and make life easier for many other guys. Especially AE when it comes to always having to generate defensive rotation.

  
I hope that covers it all. Thanks for reading, and looking forward to seeing how this team develops in the 2nd half of the season. || Better in the playoffs, yes, AE has shown to be great in that type of setting.

I know it doesn’t look pleasant now, but I think they have a chance to be special in the PO. Some tweaks have to be made, but I think there is a great team inside of the parts they have. || Thanks! I posted it in their sub (I'm not usually in there, so it might get taken down).

The zone stuff is very elementary. That should never happen with an NBA consistently in one single game. || Whats been so jarring is that there is rarely ever a game in which Minny has played greater than the sum of their parts, they havent clicked as a unit at all. || I haven't watched every game, but this might be true, which can be a positive if you're inclined to look at their glass as half-full. 

They have higher gears to get to as a team over the second half of the year. Just got to find them. || There's been multiple little 3 game sections of the season where they've clicked and gone on a 3 game win streak with each win being by 20pts. 

They'll usually come out the gate in game 4 surrendering a 14-2 run in the opening minutes and just lose their mojo for the next 10 games or so. Usually go like 4-6 in those stretches with a few single possession loses.

It's a really weird season for them. They have the talent to make a deep playoff run but the sustained chemistry has just not been there. They'll either get really hot late and upset the 3 seed or fizzle out."
Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2025-02-02,nbadiscussion,1igllkj,Considering the Mavs Return for Luka in the Context of a Hypothetical Bidding War,"No one denies that the Mavs could have gotten more for Luka. I too thought Shams made a mistake when he first reported it. However I don't think this trade is as bad of a return as most think. The reason is because we need to put ourselves in Nico's shoes and really look at the factors influencing the decision and the potential constraints he was under. I'm going to outline what some alternate trades could have happened if the hypothetical bidding war actually occurred. I only wrote down trades that A. could have potentially been better than receiving AD in the Mavs front office's mind. B could realistically happen, yet I also offer insight on why they possibly wouldn't happen. 

If you're a fan of any of the teams involved please feel free to give your insight. Also if I didn't include a team that you think had a good package please add them. 

Before viewing the alternate trades we need to list a few assumptions and considerations.

1. The Mavs want a win now player to continue to compete at a high level. Emphasis on Defense.

2. They believe Luka is seriously injured or close to serious injury and that will impact him moving forward.

3. They need to trade him to a team that he wants to resign to in order for them to get a good package.

4. Trading Kyrie is hard. Kyrie is the type of player to control his destination by any means. The only teams he would likely want to go to are the Lakers, Miami, Suns, Knicks. The only teams that would try to trade for him are the Lakers, Miami, Suns, the Clippers, and the T Wolves. Only package Mavs would care about is Jimmy Butler or maybe Norm Powell, or Julius Randle. That makes Kyrie almost a given to stay with the Mavs to keep the player assets the Mavs want, to remain competitive. So they also needed to trade for players that would not cause Kyrie to force his way out. Now back to Luka.

These are the following teams that could have offered the Mavs what they were looking for. We are prioritizing player assets because the Mavs indicated no intention of rebuilding. These trades aren't factoring in salary cap. Also you should ask yourself would Luka resign with that team after that trade. If the answer is no, you know why it wasn't considered as an option by the Mavs top brass.

Celtics (JB Holiday)

If the Celtics wanted Luka, which they may not because they too value defense, their offer may have looked like this. I believe they would try to keep Porzingis and White in favor of Trading Brown and Holiday. I'm not sure the Celtics offer this trade. 

Knicks 2 of (Brunson, Bridges, OG, Towns)

Knicks have the players to get Luka but the only combo that would be better than getting AD is Brunson and Towns for Luka. That trade would also be awkward cause it's likely the Mavs would have to move on from Kyrie, which they may not want to or can do. Also Brunson and Towns aren't defensive players. 

Cavs 2 (Mitchell & Allen) or (Garland & Mobley)

I'm sure Cavs could throw in some picks. This is one of the trades that could have competed with the Lakers offer of AD though AD is still the best player offered in this scenario. It also gives the Mavs offense and defense while getting them younger player assets than AD. However Luka resigning with Cle is a mystery.

Lakers better offer AD Reaves Knecht 

This is the head scratcher. Why didn't they get the Lakers shooters as well. Unless Luka is damaged goods, which maybe the story underneath the story. Perhaps Nico was also asked to get under the cap. 

Thunder J Dub Chet

This probably would have been the trade to have made along with a boat load of picks. This trade does create more questions about the fit between SGA and Luka and filling out the rest of the team may prove difficult. Plus I'm not sure both J Dub and Chet would be on the table in this hypothetical. Also would Luka like playing with SGA and resign in OKC?

Grizzlies (Morant) or (Banes + GG Jackson)

Morant is a great on the court player. Not as great off the court. Also not sure the Mavs want to flip Kyrie after this move. Also Morant is not a defensive player. Would Luka resign with the Grizzlies?

Pacers Tyrese Haliburton + Mathurin 

Again we run into a similar problem of having to move Kyrie after this trade. But maybe not because they can all play together due to Haliburton's facilitatiom. Again does Luka resign in Indiana?

Pelicans Murray Zion Ingram or switch any name for Jones and/or Murphy

This one is weird. Why trade Luka for more injury prone and unconditional players? I just wanted to add it as another player assets rich trade but it illustrates the issue. There are not too many landing spots for Luka. Again would Luka resign with the pels? Maybe for the food.


Honorable mentions

Rockets I think the Mavs preferred AD to any combo of Green Sengun and Eason(i think Rox want to build around Thompson. Ik Thompson shouldn't hold up a Luka trade but I'm taking the perspective of the Rox wanting to have something to pair Luka with).

Hawks Trae. Trae is amazing but he's a cut below the other PGs listed. Plus the PR nightmare of Trading Trae for Luka would not allow this to happen though it would have been funny. 

Cooper Flagg

This is an honorary mention because the Mavs don't want to rebuild. And Luka would not resign with the team who got the #1 pick. 

I feel like seeing these options, outlined, shows that Nico did not have an easy job when given the directive to move Luka and get under the tax. AD is actually a decent return. And while you may believe the Mavs should have rebuilt with picks and prospects, the Mavs don't agree. Also Trading Luka to another team makes the pick even more worthless if Luka continues playing at his current level, which the Mavs question. Luka's health also may have become a bigger issue in a bidding war. It's easy to bash this trade, but I don't think the Mavs could have found much better given the circumstances and it's a pretty good return in terms of the player they received back, especially when you factor in the alternatives and see the potential options.",0,17,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1igllkj/considering_the_mavs_return_for_luka_in_the/,2025-02-03 04:50:01,"At an absolute bare minimum, getting other teams involved puts pressure on LAL to throw their best offer at Luka rather than what they did. Reaves, another pick, maybe some swaps, etc. it also allows them to build a 3 teamer to maximize value which was impossible with the way they went about it || Timberwolves for Anthony Edwards also. Zach Lowe made the great point that if you make this trade after the season it's a much wider landscape. Maybe Chet never comes back healthy and OKC crashes out in round 2? Maybe the Rockets get upset in round 1 and it becomes clear they need a true Alpha scorer? You never know what can happen, but right now every good team thinks they have a shot at the title and after this season only 1 will get there. The rest will be searching for answers and maybe trying to save their job. That drives the price up, and likely gets you one last shot with Luka. Maybe Dallas crashes out this year cause he's never healthy and Lively doesn't come back, so the fans will be much more understanding to everything. Now with the open bidding you get the Lakers up to Knecht, Reaves, '31 FRP, and 2 pick swaps, and you get a fanbase during the offseason that is more open to considering changing course with Luka. Nobody gets blindsided, the offer gets better. I feel like that just seems like the much better course of action for a number of reasons. 

...also, maybe I'm right, Luka comes back, Lively comes back, Mavs make a run to the finals again and Nico realizes he should do everything in his power to keep and support this generational talent. Guess we'll never know. || The Mavs would not want Ja with Kyrie. Ja and Kyrie are two undersized guards and fill similar ball handling roles. While not a total liability on defense like he used to be, Ja is not a stopper. The Mavs were focused on getting positive defensive assets. I could see Ja + SPJ and/or wells and picks. 

At the end of the day, the Mavs seemed to be laser focused on AD and allegedly someone else that turned them down. My guess is Bucks or Spurs. || Still not a single one of those seems worth it. Maybe jdub and chet and a boatload of picks? || First point: Nico was under no directive to get this done. It was purely his idea. He just wanted Luka gone, so made it happen--for much less than he should have gotten.  
  
As for the value received, I will counter your argument this way: If Nico called his good buddy Rob and offered to undo the trade, would they? Absolutely not. He'd demand extra picks and probably Lively. Luka hasn't played one second for the Lakers yet, and they wouldn't accept anything CLOSE to the package the Mavs got. Hell, if Rob decided to flip Luka before Thursday, he'd demand (and get) something more than the Jazz got for Gobert. The trade is indefensible at every level. || First, yours is the type of high quality, thoughtful post that we should appreciate.  Thank you.

Second, I have to say that I really think there were literally only two options for the type of premier defender and offensive efficiency monster that the Mavs would want: (1) Giannis and (2) AD.  That's it.  When Nico said he had spoken to Kidd about desirable ""archetypes"" I have to guess he meant Giannis and AD being the mobile defensive paint beast who can play the 5 but prefers the 4 and is an absolute monster of efficiency on offense.  It's just those two guys. 

Luka isn't going to stay in MIL.  It was AD or blow up the entire roster, which was not an option while ownership is trying to get approval for a mega gambling/shopping/destination/arena complex.

I think Cuban saw issues with Luka's commitment relative to someone like Dirk, and that was some of the impetus for him selling earlier.  That part is simply wild speculation. || Lol bro the gobert trade they got 4 1st round draft picks a 1st round player from this year and 4 other decent players including Beasley....... gimmie a break the mavs was a good deal. It was a sham... and im a bulls fan sooo I Dont care but it's was a horrible trade.... yall talking bout what coulds happened but none of it did...... it doesnt matter.....it was a sht deal and will go down as the worst trade in the history of the nba.........the facts are mavs are holding the state of Texas for ransom to legalize gambling or their gonna move to Las vegas.....thats what's happening....and the new owners own a huge casino in Vegas already.... facts.... mavs coulda gotten 5 1st rounds picks and players for luka... but they settled for injury prone A.d. whos past his prime and a 2028 1st rounder 3 years away. Who knows who thats gonna be lol...and some no name player gimmie a break...... A.D. and a 1st rounder even next year is not a even deal to luka.....it's not... Luka is the golden boy of the nba right now. ZION is a flop and not the star the NBA thought he was gonna be. Luka is as biggger star than Giannis Ant because Giannis plays in Milwaukee is a small market compared to LA or Dallas..The stars of the NBA are getting old too soo la needs to have a super star in la for the nba to be news worthy snd stay popular its probablythe most popular team and the biggest market for the nba. Its a must have to have a star in la for the nba. LeBron is almost 41, steph Curry 36, chris paul 39 jimmie butler, Demar DeRozan, brooke Lopez, mike conley, James harden, Kevin Durant, jrue holiday, Damion Lillard,  are all 35-36 yrs old. Nba is declining and losing viewers.  LeBron is either retiring or getting told its time to retire in a year or 2 and Lakers got his replacement. Luka and LeBron are not compatible teammates. Lol their not...Luka is the money maker now and the team will build around him. Mavs coulda gotten alot more for luka....there is no doubt. Who wouldn't take that deal for luka lol... any team would have given there next 4 1st rounders for luka. But mavs settled for 1 1st rounder 3 years from now and a past his prime a.d. lol come on.....this deal is about Las vegas. Break the team down and then force a move.....you dont go to the finals last season then destroy your team the next season... nobody does that... pissed off their entire fan base and the arena is gonna be half full.... either Texas legalize gambling and mavs rebuild or they'll be in Las vegas......p.s. I just think this was a forced trade by the nba... didn't the nba put the kabosh and shut down a big deal trade couple years ago? Something doesn't sit right with this trade.... it's just strange || They definitely could have gotten a better return over the Summer. I don't think the T Wolves give up Ant for Luka. I'm not saying they wouldn't. I'm just saying that they need to convince Luka to re-sign after the trade. The T Wolves without Ant is not that attractive of a destination for Luka. I think the Mavs prefer AD to the Rox young core. I agree they should have gotten more out of the Lakers. No question || Obviously, the Mavs are only interested in short-term investment. They don't care about the future and banking on two aging stars. Nico just made the most important decision ever made in NBA history. || That's what I'm saying! The trade isnt as bad in context. And I'm not sure that OKC trades both of them, though they should. Cavs also have a competitive offer. Either way AD was the best player they were getting back right now. || The Lakers would not redo this trade this second no. But if you ask again at the end of the year end of next year and 5 years from now you may get a different response. That's the nature of trades. The Gobert trade went from a Jazz fleece to a win win trade back to a Jazz fleece. I agree that Rob could have gotten more but my point is not much more edit: in the context of trying to continue to compete instead of rebuilding. I outlined the alternatives to show that.

Edit: also there is no way ownership was not in on this decision and that Nico was a solo actor. Ownership was at the very least in and the fact that the Mavs got under the tax indicates it may have been their directive || They got so many picks because they didn't get a player of AD's quality back. They turned into a tanking team. AD is the best player they could have gotten when you consider that they want to compete and that whoever trades for Luka also needs to get him to re-sign and they would need enough assets to make sure they could field a good enough team around him || Nico has said he worked the deal out on his own over several weeks, and that when it was done he presented it to ownership for approval. Said that Patrick Dumont laughed at him at first.

As for undoing the trade, my point is simply that the Lakers KNOW they got Luka on the cheap. They wouldn't trade him here (or anywhere) for anything close to what they gave up. NOBODY WOULD. Only Nico was dumb enough/ego fueled to make THIS deal. Trying to put a semi-positive spin on it is defending the indefensible. Given the context, I firmly believe this will be recalled as the worst trade in league history. I can't think of a worse one. And he's destroyed the goodwill of the city and fan base in the process. It's really unbelievable. || I dont think Ad is worth that much anymore personally. He's not worth A star like Luka. Their not on the same level trade value wise. And then a 1st round pick 3 years away?....I personally think this trade was made or pushed by bigger things behind the scenes... Nba needed a huge trade to happen. And La is a huge market and needs a star to replace Lebron. La has had at least one superstar player their entire existence lol.... nba can't have their most popular org. Not winning or in the conversation. Or without a superstar... Feels like something was forced here. You can even look at the mavs press conference... lol Jason kidd was not happy and the mavs head couldn't even answer simple questions about why the trade happened.... mavs coulda afforded to pay Luka.... mavs are the 4th largest market in the nba. Money isn't the issue... I feel like there's bigger things happening behind the scenes that made this trade happen. And im not a big conspiracy guy, but this trade didn't make any sense. Especially with a 25 year old superstar... something bigger going on here...with the mavs owners, Las vegas, and / or the NBA.... this was or is one of the biggest trades in the history of the nba just cause of how much it didnt make sense......Just my 2 cents || I hear you but this is too big of a decision to be the sole responsibility of a GM. I don't care what Nico says publicly. He was not going to go up there and say the owners told me to get rid of Luka and stay under the luxury tax because they don't want to give him the super max, because that would make ownership seem cheap and get him fired. 

I agree the Lakers got Luka cheap. But not that cheap. AD is by far the best and most impactful player they could have gotten at this time and potentially if they waited. It will only be awful if Luka keeps up this level of play and availability for longer than AD is effective with the Mavs, which seems like a likely bet. But if the team that just went to the Finals with him wants to cut bait. I think that speaks volumes. It will also be awful if AD is a disaster in Dallas. I don't think he will be but it's definitely on the table. Again we may think the Mavs should want to rebuild and get a ton of picks and prospects but they didn't want that. If that's not what they wanted, they definitely got the best player available in AD. If Luka continues to miss a bunch of time and the Lakers flounder in the playoffs due to incompetence, then this trade won't turn out that bad. I think Nico was early on this so he looks crazy. It's like Mark Jackson calling Steph and Klay the best shooting back court in the league. He sounded crazy at the time because they hadn't proved it yet but he was right.

Edit: the goodwill peace will be mended by winning. The Mavericks will be a better team than the Lakers this year and next. Also Dallas doesn't have income tax. That's a big draw for FAs || Yeah because you don't value defense. If you look at the options and what other teams could/ would have offered, AD is by far the best player they are receiving back. If you don't agree please share the alternative player. Stars never really go for the equivalent value. It rarely works that way. Picks aren't that meaningful and the Mavs want to continue to compete. 

I wouldn't put it past the league and Silver to mandate this but some of what you're saying is flawed. The Lakers were ass for the end of Kobe's tenure and had a 2 year window between Kobe and Bron. Bron chose to sign there because of his business endeavors and just what Lake Show symbolizes and ingratiate Laker fans so that he can have some extra defenders for his GOAT case. 

Also this trade makes sense if you think Luka is on his way to some significant injuries and missed time. If you think he'll be healthy then yeah it's a shitty trade but not that shitty cause AD is nice. Also I don't trust the Lakers to surround Luka with talent, but who knows LA is an alluring place. || I appreciate your argument, your sharp thinking, and your coherent argument(s). But more is leaking out from the Lakers side, and they're laughing that they were able to convince Nico that they were taking on all the risk of an overweight player who drinks too much and shrunk the deal from a package that included more picks and more players by ALSO convincing Nico that there were zero suitable trade partners other than them. Your arguments sound like what they sold Nico, so congrats for figuring that out. 

And GMs talk ALL THE TIME. They float ideas long before they involve ownership. I don't think the Adelson/Dumont faction was involved or cared. I bet they do now, and Nico will be on a very short leash if the Mavs fall flat in the playoffs."
Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2025-02-04,nbadiscussion,1iicmtc,Why do I believe the AD fit - no matter the off-the-court elements - will be a terrible fit for the Mavs and a disaster in general,"I see that the general zeitgeist is ""well, AD is a great player and will be a great fit for the Mavs, the problem was the price"" and, considering what I know of the team, this could not be more wrong. I'm entirely convinced that the AD fit will be a disaster for the Mavs and would be even if everyone hated Luka. 

The expected lineup, as of now, is Kyrie/Klay/PJ/AD/Lively. On paper? Yes, strong. On the court? I don't think so. First, AD is not a knockdown shooter from deep and neither is Lively. Nico specifically mentioned the Cavs model and this is both a bad thing and a poor example. We all saw how the Cavs suffered against the Knicks and even the Magic, how their lack of shooting was hurting them and forced Mitchell to play hero ball way too often. The Cavs also had Garland, which is (at least for me) a better passer than Kyrie. Mitchell may or may not be a better scorer than Kyrie but certainly attracts more gravity than Late Era Klay. So, the Cavs had a better backcourt, more suited to try to make two non-shooters work together, and it still did not work. The Mavs will have Kyrie as primary ball handler and main passer and we have seen how he struggles in that role. Now think the Mavs will have an extremely hard time spacing the floor and how much Kyrie relies on drives (specially considering that he is a subpar pick n'roll ball handler, at least in my eye test, could be wrong), the team will have a clogged paint and will need to deal with Klay, Christie and PJ having contested 3s because perimeter defenders will feast with doubles. Odds are the whole offensive system now will be an ""your-turn-my-turn"" with Kyrie and AD, since Kyrie cannot really play off-ball from AD, AD is not an expert point forward/center and he will not have a stretch 5 to give him enough space to work an in-out offense (and he is not that good of a passer to warrant this style of offense anyway). 

On defense, which was supposed to be the main strength of the move, I'm skeptical. Let's remember that the Mavs already had good interior defense. PJ and Lively or Gafford already were a very good duo and bad rim protection was not a thing in Dallas. Mavs problem this season was perimeter defense, not interior. Now, comes AD, AD does not want to play C (and the Mavs will not be that idiotic to disgruntle AD on a very public request of his after all of this drama...I think), so he needs to play PF. This knocks Lively as C. Lively with AD will be a non-factor. On the limited pick n'roll we'll run, odds are it will be with Kyrie or Dinwiddie and AD, with Lively awkwardly hanging around waiting for a putback. On defense, sure, he or AD will be very good help defenders. but the Mavs just took their sophomore C, that in his rookie season anchored a Finals defense and showed high promise as a rim runner, and placed him in the corner. He will not even be AD's protegee because AD sees himself as a PF and will play as a PF, even if he is unable to stretch the floor. Lively, overnight, became an afterthought in Dallas and I wouldn't be 100% shocked if he is moved for a stretch 5. Now, comes PJ. In theory, moving PJ to SF strengthens the perimeter defense and makes the frontcourt a No Fly Zone...but PJ is a poor fit at SF. He has good lateral quickness, yes, but for a PF. He can hang on the neck of guards driving to the rim, yes, but he cannot chase down guards for 30mpg in every game. It's not his strength, it's an weakness that will be exploited. Teams may suffer driving to the rim even by using switches to lure Lively to the perimeter, but any movement offense will have a lot of real estate in the perimeter by exhausting PJ and relying on a defensive weak backcourt. ""Well, they have Max Christie"". Yes, Christie would be the antidote to this, but him playing means that one of Klay Thompson or PJ Washington will be benched. 

So, just to fit AD perfectly, you'll need to: 1) probably trade away your sophomore C with a very high ceiling to find any sort of stretch 5, 2) bench either your current best defender in PJ Washington or the best shooter in the team, Klay Thompson, a move that will throw a wrench in any resemblances of locker room unity and 3) either force Kyrie in a role that he showed he is not good enough, as a main ball handler, while also needing him to shoot at an elite rate. If you bring in another ball handler, that would be Dinwiddie, that would be an even worse idea defensively and would assure that TWO of Klay, PJ or Christie will be on the bench. Another possible emergency option, Grimes, was just traded for goddamn Caleb Martin, yet another forward (and honestly makes me think if Nico isn't ready to trade both PJ and Lively for a stretch 5). You destroyed the whole identity of a Finals team, a perennial playoff contender, you're left with no offensive system and, if you try to at least place in players that can mitigate the offensive issues, you'll reduce the defensive upside. There is no right answer, fitting in AD in this roster will require multiple moves that will be pretty much Kyrie and a whole new team gelling after the deadline, with a hostile fanbase, either empty stands or stands filled with aggressive fans, a media scrutiny that will reach frenzy levels and a locker room itself shaken. 

Long story short: the Mavs are set for disaster on short AND long term, on and off the court. Mavs (up to this moment) have the 2025 and 2026 FRPs, but after that? Only in 2031. 2027 and 2029 were straight up traded and 2028 and 2030 are swaps with very likely-to-be great teams in OKC and San Antonio. Now the Mavs are led by two guys over 31 years old, one of which has a player option and a record of having ugly team exits. And they traded all of that for what I believe is a terrible basketball fit,",140,122,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iicmtc/why_do_i_believe_the_ad_fit_no_matter_the/,2025-02-05 10:31:42,"I don’t agree with the Lively take. I feel both of them are rangy long athletes and will make it absolute hell for offenses in the paint. Truthfully, I don’t see how they don’t have one of the best defenses in the NBA. And AD has shown he plays best with a tall dunk/block/rebound type C. 

Offensively? I agree entirely, Kyrie has shown he is not a playmaker but more so a scorer. I do not see a true facilitator on that team which could result in some ugly offensive streaks. It’s gonna come down to coaching in a half court set to get players to their spots rather than relying on a playmaker to open up the floor for them. 

In conclusion, I don’t think the Mavs are doomed, but they have an uphill battle and time will tell. It could go right, but it could also go horribly. I’m at like 40/60. || The other thing is that are you getting locked in Kyrie or going through the motions Kyrie. I think he really liked playing with Luka. Luka could do a lot of the playmaking and was clearly the top player. Now he has to do basically all the playmaking and is paired with another guy that is better as the second best player. || This sums it up pretty nicely. The reason Lively and Gafford added any offensive value is because they had the greatest lob thrower in NBA history. Now they have AD one of the 5 best lob finishers in NBA history with no great lob throwers.    

They might improve on defense slightly, but they still won’t be in the same universe as OKC on that end. Their offense is going to crater with only one shot creator who doesn’t accentuate any of the bigs on the roster. The quality of their 3 point looks is also going to crater because they lose one of the 2 best kickout passers in the league.    

They will struggle into the play in and lose in the first round at best. || Lost me when you started using the Cavs as an example of a failure. The team that lost in the playoffs is NOT the same team as this year. We will see how it plays out but it’s clear that the JB system didn’t utilize their players correctly. The Mavs are not basing their opinion based on the 23 & 24 Cavs teams, they’re basing it on the current version that is amongst one of the best offenses in the league. || This is just anecdotal and AD knows his body and the league better than I do, but I wonder if playing the 5 helped keep AD healthy these last few years, and if going back to defending the 4 will put more lateral strain on his body and expose him to more injury risk.  

I've got a bad knee.  I never hurt it banging with other players in the post, but when I'm chasing down guards on defense is when I'm putting the kind of pressure on it that causes my injuries (that and being dumb enough to play when I haven't been doing my rehab exercises at minimum 2× per week).  

I get more scratches and bruises in the post, but I'm fine with that.  

Yes, I know he played PF in 2020, but that season was interrupted and gave him time to get healthy before the playoffs, and there was no travel during the playoffs giving him better recovery between games.  I'm not discrediting the 2020 title, the Lakers were dominant that year before the bubble, and almost every title has a weird suspension or injury to a key opponent; but I am saying that because of the weird format to the season, I wouldn't look to it as a model to replicate. || If you want and example of AD at the 4 look at the 2019-2020 season and playoffs.  AD had a lot of wear and tear saved because he didn’t have to guard the other teams center every night.  It allowed him to roam on defense and cover up any deficiency the team had on defense.  That 2 big lineup he played in was used about 50% of the time.  The rest of the time he was back at center.  Having a player like AD allows the Mavs to play small ball with a really large mobile big on the floor that can shut down the pain on his own, it also allows them to play 2 big lineups to go against a team like Denver where one guy can dedicate his entire game to making Jokic’s night as difficult as possible while AD roams on defense.  On offense an effective 2 big lineup means either a team puts a traditional PF on AD who he is way too big for or the other big is ignored and becomes an instant lob threat.  

I do agree having both Gafford and Lively is probably unnecessary and the Mavs should consider trading one of them for another 3&D wing with size because the most effective use of AD would be to have him play both C and PF in any given game.  That would realistically limit the amount of time one of them plays and likely squeeze one of them out of the lineup completely.  It bore out in the playoffs where one series you saw a good amount of Javale, against Denver Dwight got a lot of time of Joker.  Against Miami none of them really played and it was AD manning the 5 the whole series.  I would trust that Kidd recognizes this, he was a coach on that 19-20 team.  He got a front row seat at how versatile a defender AD was and what he could do when shifting between the positions. || Yep, this team is headed to the play in. I hope they tank again. They have no chance in the post season || To put it simply, the Mavs have 3 sidekicks and no Batman.  That's why it's not going to work. || You’re lacking nuance. You’re looking at it through the lens that every single team is trying to play the same exact way. You don’t NEED to be a knockdown shooter to create spacing in real life, it isn’t 2k. The Warriors for example have been running two non shooters for years (Draymond, KL) If someone is just sitting in the paint versus the Mavs. AD or Lively could just set screens for Kyrie, Klay, PJ, Martin etc & now it’s shooting practice until the big steps up. The Mavs have already been running 2-3 man screen actions before the trade. Kidd gets creative with his sets, so that’s maybe why they figured Lukas heliocentric plays isn’t a necessity anymore. They’d be better off with the improved defense instead. Kyrie & Klay are also elite off ball players to the highest degree so the fact AD can’t space the floor doesn’t matter as long as Kidd is doing what he needs to do. There’s unlimited sets the Mavs could & have run this year which takes advantage of teams defending non shooting bigs. The Mavs aren’t just rolling the ball to Kyrie & Spencer every play & telling them to figure it out. Most teams today are taking advantage of the surplus in ball handling & the skill increase around the league overall with advantage creation. Look at OKC & Boston plays. Shai, Tatum, Browns job isn’t to score every play or ast on every play. It’s just to beat THEIR man, & force a rotation. That then creates the advantage for the next player who gets the ball. Klay Thompson or PJ cant beat most good defenders straight up off the dribble. They can run past almost anybody who’s over committing to a close out. Aggregate ball handling is a very real thing in today’s game & I think the Mavs are ahead of the curve with it. Plus better defense means more margin for era. When your team is built around someone who is giving up baskets every play on the other end. Not only that superstar, but the TEAM now has to play almost perfect on offense to win games, while giving extra effort on defense to make up for the superstar not playing none. Yeah, it makes the offensive superstars numbers look great. But it’s not the best way to win championships. Non defensive superstars do not win championships. 

Defensively, you are just completely wrong. On just everything. Just to start off, replacing Luka with AD will Never. Never. Ever. Ever. Ever make your defense worst. Like we could just stop there. You are replacing Luka with Anthony Davis. There is no universe. Not a single universe where you replace Luka for AD & you get WORST defensively. The Mavs are literally, no exaggeration. Replacing probably the WORST starting defender in league, with probably the BEST defensive player in the league. At worst he’s top 3. I could tell you how AD actually strengths their defense from a scheme standpoint, but why should I go further than AD replacing Luka defensively. To say you don’t understand how the Mavs got better defensively, it makes me believe u haven’t watched Luka or AD play in your life. || What’s also being overlooked is that Kyrie is now the number one option. In Dallas, he was the second option, typically matched up against the opposing team’s second-best defender while the game plan focused on Luka. Even in that role, he was just okay. Now, facing the opponent’s best defender every night will create new offensive challenges for this Mavericks team. This isn’t the Brooklyn or Boston version of Kyrie anymore. || [removed] || Trade is bad but you comparison is off 

AD is what the Cavs hope Mobley would be.  The Knicks and the magic were able to bully Mobley with a Randle or paolo type of player.  That isn’t happening with AD. Mobley and Allen are limited offensively. || I actually feel like both teams are gonna be clunky for the remainder of the season and maybe find something in the playoffs if they make it. I think the lakers are gonna have a harder time acclimating with Mika and  not having a half decent center. || While the fit may be questionable at best, I can’t see a team with so much talent ending up terrible. The offense may stagnate at times, but the defense is going to be crazy especially if they swap out Klay for Naji in tight situations to get a stop.

What has made the Cavs thrive this year (among many things) is putting the ball in Mobley’s hands to offset his lack of spacing. AD has shown good handles for his size, better than Mobley, and can likely thrive in this role even more.

Also, I don’t think you know what zeitgeist means. || Honestly no shot Mavs are even top 5, honestly I don’t see kyrie and AD healthy to even see a second round. Luka beat this entire west which is so tough bc he was the best player. How do the Mavs improve period now or later on? They just lost every fan bc nobody can explain this basketball wise. They should move to Vegas bc they will be bottom five in attendance and they were literally the best || I think the kyrie take as far as his ability or competence in the PnR is a little off base 
in his celtic years where he was the main facilitator he was a pretty capable operator out of the pnr

in 2017-18 he was 12th in PnR possessions per game (6.7) amongst players who played 60+ games and out that group he was first in PPP (1.10)

in 2018-19 he was 18th in PnR possessions per game (6.6) amongst players who played 60+ games and out that group he was third in PPP (0.99) 

While this team isn’t very similar to boston teams i think he’s shown that he is capable of making proper reads out of the pnr if he needs to even though he prefers to be primarily a scorer. I think him being a capable operator and finisher and tight spaces can really help negate the spacing issues that come from a double non-shooting big type of lineup || I think they will have a strong interior defense. AD is at his best when you stick a center on the opposing center and he can float around away from the ball and provide help. He’s really good in this role and having two solid defensive centers and really going to allow him to thrive as the general of the defense in the middle of the floor. 

Where I’m generally concerned is the perimeter where, although you do have Pj who has some decent on ball chops, you have two seives in late era klay and kyrie. 

Kyrie has never been a plus defender and his increased offense load and play making responsibilities are going to zap an already questionable drive on that side of the ball. Klay is pretty much washed compared to what he was during his prime and injuries have pretty much destroyed his lateral movement and quick twitch burst.

I think that the interior defense covers up for a lot of this, but the true struggles are going to come on the offensive end during the playoffs. 

Kyrie is pretty much your sole shot creater and playmaker, aside from AD’s questionable flailing for foul calls (usually leads to him ending up on the floor and getting hurt) and driving to the rim. I do not think teams are worried about it AD getting creative in the mid-range/ from deep where he has taken a nose dive in efficiency since the bubble. 

There is going to be IMMENSE pressure on kyrie to be the engine that runs this offense and his size/age/history of being bullied by larger guards in the playoffs for the past few years is going to make this a real challenging role for him. || As a Lakers fan AD is a fit anywhere. 

That said, he’s an elite finisher NOT a creator. It’s one thing that always held the lakers back and made LeBron carry more of a load than he should have. It’s gonna be tough with only Kyrie throwing him passes. His ability to create in traffic is also gonna hinder how much time her can play at the PF position, since lively and gafford can’t shoot. Their offense is gonna look rough a lot. But some nights it will look unstoppable because AD will be on. 

The defense might be good but the problem is that teams actively try and pull AD out of the paint. If for offensive or injury reasons Lively or gafford aren’t in the game, it becomes the same problem the lakers had. Dallas might have better perimeter defenders tho so we’ll have to wait and see.

All in all it makes them worse now and in the future, as much as i love AD || They’ll dominate the paint with AD/Gafford/Lively and they can kick out to Kyrie, Klay, Washington.

It ain’t amazing but they’ll probably hang around and make the playoffs with a dark horse chance to make it to the second round.

I know everyone thinks everyone needs to be a shooter but there are other ways to play basketball and punish your opponent depending on other areas of your strength. || Cause you want to. Lots and lots of people think it’s a positive at least for this year. You’re overthinking it. AD doesn’t affect the 2 headed centers Lively and Gafford. Their defensive strengths next to a top 3 defensive player of this generation offsets the loss of Doncic isolation scoring. Theres a bit of overlap in positive outcomes with the Luka/Kyrie offense || You’ll lock down the paint for sure. But perimeter defense? You’re adding defense where it was ok and loosing offense that made all the current peaces makes sense. This is meltdown level disaster move, with zero understanding of modern basketball. Can’t beat Denver or OKC with this team. Probably won’t make it out of first round if they qualify. Peaces are great, but they were specifically developed to work within a Luka offense. Nico is an idiot. || Yeah the Lively take is not right.  You don’t need a 3 point shooting PF to stretch the floor for space for Lively, or a stretch 5 to make space for AD.  They can play together, and AD has enough mid-range touch and scoring gravity to space the floor.

The trade is being panned because of long term reasons.  In the short term it is debatable whether the Mavs are better, but you could make that argument.  But 2-3 years from now, or maybe sooner if Kyrie walks, their window will snap shut.  With Luka it would have been wide open || On defense, AD would not guard the opposing center in LA, but sort of play the 4, and be on a roaming role. Lebron sometimes would play the 5 on D or even Hachimura. The Lively/AD pairing will work great on D. But the OP is right in that there is only room for marginal gain, Dallas defense was already good. 
The problem does exist in offense, where AD would be the 5 in LA. Denver makes Gordon+Russ in offense with a lot of cutting (and the best passer in the world, yes), similar approach as the Cavs. Dallas will need a lot of offball movement to make this work || Can you see a trade happening sending Dray to the Mavs ?

I don't feel like Dray is as important as he was in the Warriors especially with Butler's arrival.

Also, Lively won't like to bang up with other bigs, and AD said he rather play 4. Gafford is the man for the ""Nico timeline"".

But I have a hard time seeing West-West trades anyway. || Could trade Kyrie for Trae Young? Or bring in Lonzo ball || >they had the greatest lob thrower in NBA history 

Just curious what you’re using to quantify this statement. 

In the modern era, I think Chris Paul is definitely the most prolific and successful lob-passer, and he’s been doing it for almost 20 years now. 

After that I’m pretty sure Trae and Harden also have a case, and LeBron probably deserves a shout in terms of accuracy. || I'm calling it now. The Mavs and Lakers will finish #9 and #10 and have to face each other in a Play-In game for the 8th seed || The defense will be tremendously improved. Luka had the highest blow by rate in NBA history in last year's finals and his conditioning was making him more and more of a liability on that end after already being a liability. || >The Mavs are not basing their opinion based on the 23 & 24 Cavs teams, they’re basing it on the current version that is amongst one of the best offenses in the league.

And where are they getting that that's at all a realistic expectation for their team given their personnel and current coaching? The Cavs have basically the exact same roster as last year, the difference is coaching and scheme, and we have absolutely no evidence that a team that until Christmas was running heliocentric Luka-ball and since then has had a 7-14 record in their last 21 games is capable of moving towards a Cavs model of play. 

Especially since, without Luka, Kyrie is the Mavs only playmaker better than average NBA starter level. || The current version of the Cavs has Garland and Mitchell two absolute stud shot creators both playing at an All-NBA level."

Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2025-02-07,nbadiscussion,1ikd9gj,Will somebody surpass steph curry's record? Players that can reach 3000 3 pointers and how many i think they will get (out of the current top 250 players for total 3 pointers),"I see people making strong statements saying that you are kidding yourself if you don't think that curry's record will be surpassed ""by manu guys"". Of course if the nba exists for 200 more years everything will be surpassed by manu guys but This is my prediction as far as players who are in the top 250 of bball ref, which is 800+

Curry (5000) and Harden (3500) already have  
Lillard (3600)  
Thompson (3300)  
Mitchell (3200)  
Tatum (3500)  
Doncic (3600)  
Edwards (3500)

close but no: pg buddy hield kd lebron, mccollum.

I may be exaggerating curry's number but he still scores 4,2 3pointers per game. It's true that steph curry's record is not optimized which is crazy considering how much above everybody else he is. Curry has lost quite a few hundreds 3 pointers by being born before the curry revolution. Then he also played 3 years in college, also his durability has been very average, 2 big injuries + many missed games every year.\*\* But at the same time

a) it's incrediby tough to beat it. for example if you play an elite 1300 games (24 players in history, chris paul is at 1320) and you manage to have a 3,3 3 pointers per game, you are at 3900, which is his current number (3925). The thing is, currently, after curry (3,9) the 2nd highest is 3,1 (klay) and 3,0 (lillard) btw two players from his generation. some young players that now average around 3,0 can grow of course because they scored less of them in the first few seasons, but it's tough to imagine that it can grow to 3,3 or more, or maybe it can for a bit before going down this mark at the end of their career. Of course they could play more than 1300 games, there have been some guys at 1400, 1500 and even 1 at 1600, but that's incredibly rare and ofc average goes down as total games go up.

b) there havent been elite all time great shooters in the last years, or at least great great shooters that are great players or great shooters that seem to have great longevity. all the guys scoring a lot of 3s are not great shooters. edwards, doncic, tatum, mitchell, all go from decent to good (mitchell), for all of them elite shooting is not the main part of their game, edwards and mitchell are more athletic than shooters, tatum is shot creation at his height and versatility, doncic is overall offensive creation and playmakig. beside this edwards outlier season.

Steph curry's record can be broken, but there needs to be somebody in the league who's an all time great shooter and a great player and that will have great longevity, and for now we don't have anything like that.

\*\*it's tough to have it all, for example stoctkton has those unbeatable records despite not playing a lot his first 3 years, also playing 4 years of college, and also playing at least half of his career in a low pace era. james scoring record on the other hand is pretty optimized. he started playing at 18 when you could go straight out of hs, ofc he has one of the highest career ppg, the first 10 years of his career he played in a low scoring era but now he played more than half in a high scoring one. not totally tho cause he shoots less than other players + he didnt start in a high scoring era. wilt's rebounds record is very optimized cause in those times they averaged damn near double the reboudns and the guy played all the minutes",158,78,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ikd9gj/will_somebody_surpass_steph_currys_record_players/,2025-02-07 21:55:14,"Yes, it’ll happen eventually. 

Curry wasn’t chucking threes quite at the rate he is now when he first entered the league. Not to mention his first few years were plagued with injury. 

You already have players coming in shooting multiple threes a game while remaining healthy. ANT just earned the nod for the youngest player to reach 1000+ threes. ANT is already on pace to do it so long as he stays healthy, and there will undoubtedly be more players who come in who
shoot a lot of threes while remaining healthy

Will Curry be passed as the “greatest” shooter ever? I don’t think so any time soon, but his record will be broken. || Nobody in the league right now is surpassing him.

This recent wave of young NBA talent still was not fully immersed in the 3pt revolution. They may have molded their games around it in HS and college but it’s not the game they grew up playing.

Kids these days are trying to play Steph Curry’s game. It will still take a generational talent to overtake him but they will arrive in the next 20 years imo. || It’ll happen for sure. Curry could stay the greatest ever but he missed a lot of time entering the league late, being the one to revolutionize the 3 means he wasn’t taking as many as he should early in his career, and injuries. || If Silver pushes through with that 10 min quarter, then no, no one is surpassing him... || every record (except maybe wilts 100 and stocktons career assist record due to inflated stats) can be broken. remember, kareem’s record was thought to be unbroken until a few years ago || Steph is sitting at 3925 3PM right now. Let's say he retires with about 4800. That means someone has to average 300 3PM for 16 years. I think that's technically doable, but under the assumption that 3pt FG volume goes way up. Last year, Steph made 357 3PMs. Nobody else in the league made 300.

What would make Steph's record vulnerable? Steph was 21 when he entered the league, so someone who enters as a teenager has a few years head start. Also, Steph didn't even attempt 500 3PAs in a season until his 4th season, and didn't attempt 10 3PAs a game until his seventh season. Add in a few injury-riddled seasons and he left a lot of 3PMs on the table.

That said, if someone else ever makes 402 3PM in a season, I'd be astonished if he made them at a .454 clip. And I'd also be shocked if someone shoots .454 3pt٪ and makes even 350 3PMs. Maybe it can happen if the NBA pushes even softer defenses and teams averaged 130 ppg. || I doubt anyone can make 5000 3 pointers in their career. 
Hypothetically, let's assume a legend comes up at 18 years to the league and plays till he's 38.(Not everyone can be LeBron).
In those 20 years, he'll have to make 250 3s every single year. Considering how most players are only playing in 60-70 games each regular season, it's about (3.4-4.1) 3pm each season. There are 25 players who make more than 3 per game and 12 who make at 3.4 per game.
If you expect 4 per game then it's only 3 players.
Also, the highest ppg by a rookie this year is 15 and 3s is 3 per game.**
Keeping all that in mind, you'd need a  generational player being top 20 in 3s per game and can hit it consistently for more than 20 years and you'll still be lacking a little.
Now let's consider Steph Curry's ceiling.
He's made 3925 3 pointers till now.
He might add another 100-150 by the post season and then 500-600 on top of it.
He'll have a ceiling of 4600-4750.
That's tough to beat. 
The guy has to be generationally good, make 3.5-4 3s a night for over two decades and.... he'll still be under 300-500.
(4×65 =260. 260×20= 4200)
Steph is amazing. You have to realise that everyone shooting 3s might change how the game is, but even so, everyone is sharing the shots, so it's not one guy is making over 5 3s for a whole decade.
I think many will come close, like Ant. But...he's not Steph || Steph inspired a generation of players to bomb away from 3. His record will be broken || ANT has scored 1001 in 4 1/2 seasons. This has moved him from 2974 away from the record to 2924 away from the record.

A lot can change in the nba in the time it would take to catch the record. There could be 4 point shots and no corner 3's before he gets anywhere close. || Hard to say. On the one hand the league has changed so much that the conditions are currently more inviting for someone to come along and break the record. On the other hand, Curry is an extremely unique talent. We also don’t know how long this iteration of nba offense will last. If the nba eventually moves back the 3 point line, or at least gets rid of the corner 3, it’d be hard to see anyone touching the record || Curry had a special combination of elite shooting genetics and dedicated training from a young age, along with his competitive drive (which separated him from Seth). His own children may be the only people capable of eventually breaking his record someday. || It's gonna happen in our lifetime bud. Look at Ant being the fastest to reach 1,000 3's, there are only going to be more players coming in the respect these guys and want to be better. || Curry had 900 at LUKA's age.

Luka have 1300 already.

The rest will be history. || I think young players who will be chucking 3’s their whole career in bulk, from the start of their careers will overtake Curry.  But that doesn’t stop Curry from being the greatest shooter ever. || There are already quite several players on pace to surpass Steph’s record, we have rookies dropping 9 3’s in games already. Some players are averaging 3-5 3pms for the season. 

His record will be broken sooner rather than later but he knows this and doesn’t bother him in the slightest. || [removed] || While I agree with the sentiment someone will catch him there is context to saying Ant is on pace just for the fact Ant is chasing a hockey stick that’s about to kick up to the right.

From 24yo-30yo Steph made 2,113 threes. 

The race to 2k and 3k are going to be interesting to watch || 2011-2012 was the only year he really was seriously affected by injury. He played 80 games on 2009-2010, 74 games in 2010-2011, and played 78+ games from 2012-2017. || We need to realise that Steph was not a volume 3pt shooter in the first few years of his career (compare now) and he also missed alot of games due to injuries. He is not the fastest to reach 1K 3ptrs. 

Anthony Edwards already have 1K in only 300+ games. 

With the 3pt revolution, the guy who will break his record has already arrived or will be in the next 5 years. || Steph Curry’s first all star season was 11.5 years ago. Anthony edwards was 12. And he’s been in the league for 5 years. Risacher was 8 lol. Paolo was 11. Wemby was 9-10. These dudes definitely group up in Stephs shadow || Ant? He already has like 27% of Steph’s record and he’s like 22 || >Nobody in the league right now is surpassing him

That’s a strong statement. Anthony Edwards clearly has a chance if he plays long the like and doesn’t get injured. I’m not saying he will with that high of a chance but it’s clearly greater than 0 percent. 

No one should ever make absolute statements like this.  || The fact that Curry wasn't an all-star player at the beginning of his career will make his record more accessible to break. People forget that he's still a late bloomer since he joined the NBA in 2009. I also don't think it will take a generational talent to beat him. All that person needs to be is a 3 point specialist. || What are you talking about? Kids in 2016 were already playing Currys game. 

It's just that 3 pointers are hard, so nobody is going to close to it anytime soon. 

Lamelo was drawing all sorts of Curry comps as a young player. || Ant is on pace... we'll see if he stays healthy. Either way I don't really buy the premise that they needed to be indoctrinated into the way of the three as children in order to do it. || luka has been firing off steph amount of threes since his rookie year he is an easy candidate if he plays 8-10 more years also wemby shooting 10 threes a game || Luka, Trae, and Donovan will all pass Steph in career 3s made. || did you read the post? || Reboundings impossible, games just so different now || I mean. Records can be incredibly specific so no, there are many records that can't be broken. but even As far as career totals in the 5 major categories wilt's 24k rebouds is unbeatable cause at the time there were damn near double the total rebounds. also wilt lacks longevity but played all the minutes. and ofc he was an incredible rebounder. duncan has the most between players drafted after 75 and he has just 15k. if blocks were recorded earlier wilt/bill blocks record would also be unbreakable cause they were 2 freaks and there were so many more blocks because of shots being closer to the rim on average.  stockton assist and steals record is also pretty unbreakable, not because of ""inflated stats"" but because that's what you get when you combine goat level longevity (6th in total games) with 2nd in career average apg and 7th steals. So that leaves us with lebron's record. Lebron's record is theorically beatable because of the fact that lebron's career average points of 27 is one of the highest but not the highest, especially now if the average stay this high. but still it's incredibly difficult cause lebron will probably end up being 1st in total games played. Lebron will finish this season over 42k points, i expect him to play 2 other seasons, but 1 is also possible so lets estimate 44-45k. If we assume that there's a legendary career 32 ppg career scorer he would still need around 1400 games which is incredible longevity."
Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2025-02-10,nbadiscussion,1ime6jh,"KAT's defense at the 4, or KAT's offense at the 5 - Do we really have to choose?","**""The Knicks are suffering because KAT can't play defense at the 5, but if you shift him to the 4 his offense gets worse.""** I see this take floating around both the Knicks and the Wolves subreddits, as if it is a sort of ""pick your poison"" conundrum,  and I just don't agree with it for a number of reasons. I think the Wolves had largely solved the problem of KAT being a poor rim protector by adding Rudy Gobert next to him, and I think that should be the blueprint moving forward for KAT. 

However, when I ask people to elaborate on it, I haven't really gotten much of a concise answer other than a reference to offensive rating, so I want to dive a little bit into the numbers to see if that take really holds water. Specifically, I will only be looking at his offensive impact because he is a putrid rim protector, and I have no interest in proving that statistically. So in order to evaluate his offensive impact, I think we should evaluate KAT in 2 ways - the first being his individual offensive impact, and the second being his team offensive impact. So let's get into it. 

Side notes, I am not looking at offensive win shares because win shares are pretty heavily influenced by rebounding, and KAT's rebounding role was significantly smaller next to Rudy. I also don't think the 2022-2023 season should be an indictment on him either, considering he was out 50+ games from injury, started the season under weight, and he was adjusting to a new position. Although it was one of his worst years offensively, I still do not think it should carry as much weight.

--------------

**Individual Numbers:**

There are a number of individual statistics that we could look at to evaluate KAT's offensive impact, but because his role changed pretty drastically with Anthony Edwards, and half of his time since Ant was drafted was spent at the 4, it's a little bit difficult to identify which stats are more telling. I don't think PPG is necessarily an indictment on his ability at the 4. 

I think that **EFG** is probably the most telling stat of KAT's potency at the 4 vs at the 5. In 2023 - 2024, KAT had an EFG of .575, and his career EFG is .578. This stat is the first argument in why I don't believe that KAT is more effective offensively at the 5 than he is at the 4. If what people say is true about KAT being more effective at the 5, you would expect that the first full year he spent at the 4 would be his worst, but it was at the same relative averages of his career (Spent entirely at the 5.) He was also absurdly efficient in the first 2 series of the playoffs last year, far more efficient than any series at the 5. (In the Dallas series, it really felt like only Gobert and McDaniels came to play. Everyone else was abysmal.)

**His AST%** remains about the same as his career averages when he is at the 4 vs at the 5. I do want to point out that he had a career in assists during his first year at the 4 with Rudy, which could indicate that he is better at sharing the ball when he has someone down low he can dumb it off. That being said, I won't allow this to carry too much weight considering I said I was going to largely ignore the 22/23 season given how short it was. This year at the 5 is actually the lowest AST% of his career, except for his first 3 years in the league. 

**TOV%** in 2023/2024 was not significantly higher than it had been his previous 4 years at the 5. It is a bit higher than his career averages, but his first 3 years in the league were well below his averages - So his TOV% was far closer to what you'd expect from his prior 4/5 years. In fact, his TOV% usually rises with his AST%, as is an expected correlation with those 2 stats. 

The claim that I tend to see is that KAT's offense takes such a drastic dip, that it isn't worth putting him at the 4, but if that were the case, you would see some noticeable drop in his offensive production or his offensive efficiency when he plays at the 4 - but that isn't the case. The only statistical category which we can observe a noticeable drop in is his rebounding, and that can be explained by the fact that he was playing with Rudy. 

-----------------

**Team Stats**

So if his individual numbers aren't really that much worse, it must mean that his team impact is lower, so let's take a look. For starters, I don't think it carries a ton of weight to begin with because KAT's most successful team was also the year he spent the most time at the 4. The only argument I've really seen against KAT's team impact has been team offensive rating. In 2023-2024, the Wolves were a pretty middling offensive unit. Ranking 16th in the league, but does that mean KAT's place at the 4 was the contributing factor to that middling offense?

According to cleaningtheglass which adjusts for garbage time and possessions at the end of quarters that are highly likely to end up in a heave, league average offensive rating was 115.6 - and the Wolves were above that average mark at 116.1. So while they were 16th, they still above league average offense. This was also the best Wolves offensive rating of KAT's career, not accounting for relative team offenses. 

You might say that this was not a good number regardless, but if you look at this further, the middling offense has far less to do with things like team efficiency, or other stats that KAT could influence from being at the 4, and is likely influenced by 3 other stats. Those being:

The Wolves did not play with a ton of **pace** in 23/24. They much preferred slower games since they were so good on the defensive end, and they were efficient (Top 10 in FG% and top 3 in 3pt%.) Of course, offensive rating accounts for pace considering that it is points / 100 possessions, but teams with a higher pace have a tendency to have a higher offensive rating because it usually comes as a result of faster possessions, transition offense, and transition offense has a tendency to be much easier buckets. The Kings 2/3 years ago, and the Pacers last year are great examples of this tendency of higher pace = higher offensive rating. While offensive rating accounts for pace, pace does not account for the type of possessions, so let's look at 2 other factors. 

**Transition offense** is something that heavily influences pace. If you are running in transition, possessions are not only ending faster, resulting in a higher pace, but they are also resulting in easier buckets, meaning that the offensive rating would inflate. And the Wolves were not good in transition. In 23/24, Minnesota was bottom 3 in transition FGA per game. 

Finally, **Turnovers** would be another stat that would negatively impact offensive rating while not being reflected in pace. The Wolves were bottom 10 in turnovers last year. Pace does not account for a turnover ending in a turnover vs ending in a shot, just that there was a possession at all. While KAT was a massive perpetrator of turnovers, he has always turned the ball over quite a bit, and it isn't unique to him at the 4. 

Pace, transition offense, and turnovers are all things that would negatively impact a team's offensive rating while not necessarily being the fault of KAT, as they are stats that are usually influenced by either the team's lead guard, or a schematic theme. 

------

So, I want to dispute the notion that it is either ""KAT's offense at the 5 or KAT's defense at the 4."" I feel like while it's easy to look at his raw counting stats and say ""Well KAT surely does better at the 5,"" I do not believe that there is any statistical backing to that claim. Despite playing the 4 in 2023/2024, KAT remained one of the league's most dynamic 3 level scorers in the league last year, being hyper efficient from inside, the 3, and getting to the line a ton. 

KAT's offense drops off *very* little (If at all) while at 4 vs at the 5. But while his offense doesn't change that much from the 4 or the 5, KAT is a putrid rim protector and always has been, arguably one of the worst in the league (Especially in drop coverage) and so it does not make sense to put him at the 5. His defense is far more valuable at the 4. I think that last year, we saw the blueprint for how team's should aim to deploy KAT in the future. Considering he spaces the floor well, putting a non-shooting big man at the 5 isn't as punishing as it might feel. So placing a rim protecting big next to him where he can shift and be a big body on the outside is a much better role for him. We saw last year in the playoffs that he was a much more switchable defender, and was able to be much more effective when given specific defensive assignments like Jokic and Durant. 

I think that if the Knicks choose to deploy Mitchell Robinson at the 5, and KAT at the 4, we will see a similar product to last year's KAT, which was arguably the best year of his career considering team success, and his value on both ends of the ball. 

--------------

TL;DR: It isn't because KAT is playing the 5 again that his offensive production has surged, It's more likely that there are 2 contributing factors to him having a standout year offensively.

1) He has an expanded role and he gets more opportunities with the Knicks simply because they play faster offense than the Wolves did. He is also playing with an elite distributor in Brunson. 

2) He is now in his prime. He was never given a chance to be in his prime with the Wolves. It's pretty likely that a player having their best year offensively also happens to be in years players traditionally have their best stretch of their career.

Let me know what you think!",192,43,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ime6jh/kats_defense_at_the_4_or_kats_offense_at_the_5_do/,2025-02-10 14:09:16,"What you’re missing is who’s guarding him on the other team, which is really what matters when looking at his position. At the 5, he’s typically being guarded by a traditional center (who 9 times out of 10 can’t guard him). At the 4, that same center doesn’t have to guard KAT, so they’re typically positioned at the rim guarding whoever the team has at the 5. This allows them to be a deterrent at the rim for KAT, who doesn’t get a great whistle on his drives. In addition, PFs are usually more mobile and can guard KAT on the perimeter better. This means that they’re not afraid to step out on him, leading to less open 3s. If he blows by them? Meet rim protector.

This is one of the reasons that stats can help contextualize things, but it’s important not to discount the fans who actually watch the games. KAT is definitely still elite at PF, but there are definitely reasons why he is less of a matchup nightmare at the 4 vs at the 5. I can also dive into his defensive problems at the 5, but I get the sense that you understand that. || So one thing to keep in mind IMO is KAT in 23-24 had a huge reduction in double teams. Ant absolutely became the best player on the team & was the one being doubled the most. Idk if theres stats to back that up, but KAT hasn’t been great at handling doubles & that was one thing making his life easier that season. || He's playing more minutes and has higher usage. Jalen Brunson distributes more/better than Ant. Don't think it's more complicated than that. || There's a big difference in his catch-all metrics in both box-score metrics (O-BPM) and the plus-minus metrics (O-LEBRON, DARKO, etc.), when playing at the 4 v.s. the 5. I don't think any analysis can justify that as simply a blip. 

Using his career averages as a comparison is pretty disingenuous, especially when you go on to make distinctions that the first years of his career affect the data only when it affects you. When bringing up AST%, why not mention that his early seasons dragged it down severely? He had a 19.4 AST% in the four seasons prior to the Rudy acquisition (2018-2019 through 2021-22), and averaged 17.3 AST% in the two seasons with Rudy. That's not a huge one, but it is significant and meaningful. 

On TOV%, he averages 13.6% in those four seasons, compared to 14.4% in his last two seasons in Minnesota. Given he's never had a season above 14% aside from those two seasons, I'm inclined to believe that difference is not a result of variance - and 1% more turnovers is pretty meaningful imo, especially when you yourself say that assists are correlated with turnovers - yet he was averaging substantially less assists in those seasons.

There's also a point to make regarding his efficiency - it's important to compare relative to the league average, and when offense is going up as a whole, him having basically the same eFG as his career average (slightly lower, in fact) indicates that he's been less efficient. Looking at rTS (better metric for efficiency), he shot +6.2 in 2018-2019, +8.1 in 19-20, +3.9 in 20-21, +7.8 in 21-22. The two years with Rudy, he shot +3.6 and +4.5. That's a clear drop-off. from around +6.5 to +4. So his efficiency has pretty much dropped 2%. Supporting this idea, we can simply look at his lineup data with and without Rudy when they were both on the Wolves - KAT shot 64.4 TS% without Rudy on the floor and 61.2 TS% with him on. 

On the team aspect, I don't see how any of the explanations for the team offensive efficiency not being good stand up. Pace has very little correlation with offensive rating. The 2025 Knicks actually play at the 26th fastest pace in the league, slower than last year's Timberwolves, and have the 2nd best ORTG. Transition offense is mostly just an expansion on pace, and I'll just note that KAT isn't a huge driver or beneficiary of transition offense anyways. 

I also don't think it's fair to just ignore offensive rebounding because that's 'Rudy's duty'. The point is KAT's offensive rebounding loses value when he's played at the 4 v.s. the 5. This isn't a Rudy-specific issue, the same thing is likely going to happen with Mitchell Robinson at the 5. Considering ORB% is a decent driver of offensive impact, it's definitely a factor to consider when discussing the differences between him at the 4 and him at the 5. 

  
2024 was KAT's most successful year in terms of team record because there was the most talent surrounding him. The last time he had a teammate as good as either Ant or Gobert was back in the Jimmy Butler days when he was a second year player, and that team ended up making the playoffs and being the second most successful team KAT has been on (excluding the Knicks, of course). Does this mean second-year KAT was better than KAT from 2019 to 2022? Surely not. 

>  
Considering he spaces the floor well, putting a non-shooting big man at the 5 isn't as punishing as it might feel.

Yes, but you're missing something - it's not punishing in the sense that the spacing is perfectly viable, but that's not the problem. The problem is you're taking away KAT's superpower. Perhaps the biggest appeal of KAT's game is being able to attack 5s, which frees up so much for the offense. He gets to attack slower bigs either off the drive or with his outside shot, without having to worry about bigs lurking in the paint. His teammates reap the benefits too, with the shot-blocker pulled out to the perimeter because they're worried about KAT's shooting. 

  
TL;DR: There's definitely a significant difference in the offensive categories you mentioned when KAT plays at the 4 v.s. the 5, and it becomes even more obvious when we look at catch-all metrics. It's easy to take a narrative and run with it, but in this case the narrative is clearly backed by years of evidence and I don't know how you can deny that. || KAT played the 4 next to Rudy Gobert - one of the best defensive anchors in NBA history, of course his defensive metrics popped. || Honestly, I've heard less  about KAT's  game  being impacted but more so the Knicks' offense  being impacted. The  Knicks have  a  Top  2 offense while  being the  6th  best  3PT  shooting team in the   NBA  (%  wise.)  And a  huge part  of that  is KAT  at the  5  being the ultimate  spacing cheat code.   
 
4/5 Knick starters are shooting above average from 3  with the  ""worst"" one being Josh  Hart at 34.3%. Basically,  it's  a lot harder to help vs the Brunson drive knowing he  has  4  other options  who are good/deadly  from 3. [Among PnR players, Brunson comes in with the 2nd highest PPP at 1.09](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/ball-handler?CF=POSS*GE*5&dir=D&sort=PPP) behind only Shai.   
 
On the other side of the KAT/Brunson combo, [KAT is ranked 3rd in  roll game per PPP](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/roll-man?CF=POSS*GE*2&dir=D&sort=PPP) behind Allen and Jokic.  [The  Knicks rank 4th in spot  ups by PPP](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/spot-up?dir=D&sort=PPP)  
  
Logically, it all makes sense  why this offense  is so deadly. There's no  real weak  points on the offense. But if you're  bringing  Mitch in to clog  up  the spacing, you can't expect it to not  have a negative effect on the offense. || Pretty interesting stuff. Tbh smth that Kat did well last year was throwing lobs to gobert, like very well, and prob is smth him and Mitch could emulate.

I do think that Kat at the 5 just opens up the floor more for everyone else on this Knicks team especially, but clearly the stats don’t fully support that. I’m rly excited to see Mitch and Kat play together, Idt they will start immidiately w each other but if it goes well like u predict maybe they do start w each other. || Excellent write up, it's too bad he's so banged up that he barely resembles the player from earlier in the season.  Props to him for gutting it out, but he hasn't been the same player since his thumb injury. And his knee issues don't help either.  Mitchell Robinson is going to be huge in getting Kat some rest and games off down the stretch. || [removed] || Seems like a simple answer considering the Warriors prioritized Draymond Green defense and offensive point man abilities at 4 over scoring of any kind and they have won many many rings doing so. Take the defense and don’t think too much about it. || I totally agree with your points! The whole ""pick your poison"" idea just doesn't hold up when you break down KAT's numbers and role. His offensive efficiency doesn't really dip when he's at the 4, and in fact, he becomes a more versatile defender next to a rim protector like Gobert. You’re also spot on about the Wolves' offensive struggles being more related to pace, turnovers, and transition play than KAT's positioning.

I like how you emphasized that his role with the Knicks, alongside an elite distributor like Brunson and in a faster offense, is giving him more opportunities to shine. Plus, the fact that he's entering his prime makes his offensive production this season even more believable.

In the end, it seems like the blueprint for KAT is exactly what you described—having him play the 4 and pairing him with a solid rim protector at the 5. That’s where he can make the most impact without the defensive liabilities he has at the 5. Well thought out analysis! || [deleted] || [removed] || A lot of teams had shifted to the Utah defense style on him.   Put their 4 on him and send help in post up situations as required. || This has been my thinking as well. I love what Mitch brings from a defense and offensive rebounding standpoint. I wish he had better hands though when it comes to receiving passes. He’ll probably have plenty of opportunities for close open looks if KAT can get to the rim and the 5 has to move off Mitch to defend the drive.

Completely agree regarding the KAT offensive side of it. With 5’s they either play him a step back to try and avoid getting beat on the drive or play up and he blows by them. Having that 5 in the paint to defend the drive takes away a big part of his offense. Mitch clogs the paint. I’m sure we’ll see that lineup but I wouldn’t expect it to be the starting 5. || Regardless of who is guarding him, whether it be the 5 or another 4, KAT is remains about the same level of efficiency at all 3 levels. If it were true that 4's were guarding him better, we would see a significant drop in his efficiency. The only offensive drop we really can observe is in his FTr. 

And yeah, I'm a huge Wolves fan and have watched almost every game over the last 4/5 years so this is stats helping contextualize the eye-test. || That would absolutely be something worth looking at but I don't have the numbers for that either. I don't really know where I'd go to look for those. || Funnily enough, his usage is actually lower this year than it was last year (not by much) but it definitely doesn't help my case. || First off, I want to say that I appreciate the write up. This is what I was looking for; someone to meaningfully engage with each of the points that I talked about and you did. That being said, I agree with some stuff and disagree with others. But one thing I certainly disagree with, and I touch on a bit is that I do not believe that catch all stats are a good reference here considering his role changed drastically with Rudy, and thus his stats did. 

Unless I'm misinformed on the formulas, catch all stats weigh rebounding pretty heavily on both ends - and that is why I discount rebounding. Not because ""It's Rudy's job,"" but because the sheer volume of rebounding that KAT had to do at the 4 would artificially deflate the impact he provides when those formulas do their calculations. An example of this is win shares, and I know specifically that basketball-reference had to adjust their catch-all formulas because Russell Westbrook was considered the best defensive player in history according to their formula because his rebounds were so insane, which is obviously not true. Nikola Jokic's defensive shortcomings are also scrubbed a bit due to those formulas weighing rebounding. Comparing those catch-all stats year over year for KAT would be disingenuous because KAT's role changes. 

We'll start with career distinctions - the only stat I went on to make a distinction about regarding his first years in the league vs the remainder of his career was turnover rate because they are such drastic outliers comparatively to the remainder of his career. I don't know if that's disingenuous so much as his worst year is closer to his average than his best year is. We could throw out his best and his worst year and then his time at the 4 is far closer to his expected turnover rate. If I did include his first year with Rudy, it would also completely boost his assist rate. 

As far as efficiency, I suppose that's fair but I've also repeatedly indicated that his first year with Rudy should be considered more of an outlier considering the context of that season (coming into the season underweight, missing 53 games, and adjusting to the 4 for the first time) meaning that if we only account for his second season with Rudy, +4.5, while lower than the average, is still higher than some of his other seasons at the 5. If it were true that his offensive potency drops, you would expect his seasons at the 4 would be his absolute worst seasons, which they are not. It seems far more in line with a regular fluctuation of a player's efficiency year over year. 

For team aspect, I said I don't think that offensive rating is a good marker for KAT's impact on the team because offensive rating is influenced by stats that are not necessarily due to KAT's role, but moreso the lead guard or the scheme. Turnovers are a great example of this, being that the Wolves had a horrific turnover% last year, and that certainly played into the poor offensive rating, since while offensive rating accounts for pace, pace does not account for turnovers. 

Furthermore, I reference pace not as an indicator of offensive rating, but more like a barometer, and there absolutely is correlation - I would argue the Knicks are more of an exception than they are the rule. I said that team's have a *tendency* to have a higher offensive rating when they have a higher pace because of transition offense, which I do not think is fair to just call an ""expansion on pace."" It can't be considered just an expansion because the efficiency of them is so different. League average FG% is .465 this year, and while I can't find the exact number for league average transition FG%, it seems to be around 53-54%, significantly higher than regular FG%. And teams are taking about ~20 transition attempts a game on average, which would equate to about 1/5 of total possessions, I don't know how that could be considered insignificant. If the Wolves are simply not taking as many transition attempts (They aren't taking as many as other teams), it would not reflect in their offensive rating, but it would reflect in their pace. 

-----

My point is this: While there is a very slight drop in KAT's offensive potency when he plays the 4, I do not think it is enough to justify putting him at the 5 where he has to deal with his biggest shortcoming - he is a putrid rim protector. Like, arguably worst in the league of starters. It makes sense to place him at the 4 where he has a marginal drop in production, where you can hide him easier and give him more specific defensive assignments. 

You claim the drop-off is significant, but on both the team and the individuals numbers you've provided, they are like 2-3% changes, if that. That's a pretty marginal drop-off, and we see that level of change frequently within players year-over-year. It could easily be justified and explained that it's a standard fluctuation within the context of a career, as opposed to a change in position. || Yeah and I don't think it needs to be all game either. Having KAT play staggered minutes, some at the 4 and some at the 5 was a pretty common tactic last year. Chris Finch would just switch defensive schemes depending on which role KAT was playing.

So if KAT plays 36 minutes per game, maybe 20 of those could be with Mitch, give or take some. Mitch wouldn't even have to start. Maybe KAT sits after 8 minutes then starts the 2nd quarter with the Knicks second unit || He was an extremely good player across the first 2 series last year after coming back early from surgery. He only fizzled out in the Dallas series when 

1) everyone else was awful and 

2) he was tired which can likely be explained by him coming back early and having just played a 7 game series vs Denver.

Bad playoff players are bad until they prove they can be good and KAT certainly proved he could play some winning basketball. || We removed your comment for being low effort and low quality. || Didn’t mean to downplay your viewing stats, I just don’t think the efficiency stat is a perfect stat that explains how good a player is in totality. 

I think you’re missing my point about that rim protector being pulled out the paint with KAT at the 5 affects teams. I also think Mitchell Robinson at the 5 would be great for the Knicks, but being able to go 5 out is a great option for the Knicks when OG is back healthy. KAT is a great passer (was the best on the wolves imo) so that helps him at the 4, but the lack of spacing (unless he becomes strictly a floor spacer which I don’t like) hurts the team overall. I think they go forward with him at the 4 in the future but a JJJ/Giannis mold 4 would be the ideal front court partner imo. || Even though this doesn’t directly impact his own stats, KAT at the 5 allows the Knicks to play a truly 5 man out game. If he’s at the 4 and Mitch is at the 5, teams can stack the paint. With Hart at the 4, the Knicks have 5 legit players who can hit the open 3 or drive to the hoop. || The other thing i didn’t like about KAT at PF (& this is just observational so i could be wrong) was it seemed to increase his drives where he fell trying to draw a foul 🙄 and lead to fast break points at a very high clip on other end. Jim Pete used to bring it up all the time.  Idk if thats 100% related to C/PF but increased in frequency around the time we got Rudy.

Thats one of the biggest holes in KATs game at least in MN, always grabbing/holding trying to draw fouls and more often then not getting (rightly) called on him. His trying to play the foul game absolutely back fires on him in a major way, hurting his value.  Idk if thats still happens in NY but was the biggest issue with him here.  Just was very low IQ. || I probably shouldn't have used the term usage because Usage rate includes TO's. His last year rate was only higher because his TO rate was higher. I mean that he gets to shoot the ball and touch it more. Maybe more involved is the better word. || The reason why I mentioned both box score metrics and plus/minus based metrics was to cover both bases - even if the box score metrics did overweigh rebounding, there's no reason to believe that purer plus/minus metrics or even hybrid metrics would do the same, or at the very least the effect would be much weaker. On/off is a noisy stat, but we can see the in the two seasons he played with Rudy he had an on/off of -0.73, and in the prior 4 seasons his on/off was +7.90. Again, this is a noisy stat that's influenced by his teammates getting better, but it serves as an example to show that there are metrics that completely ignore rebounding that judge his impact as worse in those two seasons. More sophisticated metrics to account for lineup adjustments, or the different versions of RAPM out there, also reflect a clear difference in impact. Hybrid metrics, which would only incorporate rebounding numbers as part of a box prior for the RAPM calculation, also agree on this. It's a pretty universal phenomenon. 

By the way, I think it's a bit of a myth that catch-all metrics overvalue rebounds - in some ways, they do, yes, but only because there aren't any defensive box score metrics that serves as a good proxy of defense. Both your examples of rebounding inflating box score have to do with the defensive side of the metrics, and when there isn't any reliable proxy of defensive player impact in the box score (STL% and BLK% are both flawed in that regard, and Jokic/Westbrook both perform well in those metrics anyways), you're forced to rely more on defensive rebounds. On the offensive side, however, we can weight metrics such as points, assists, turnovers, efficiency, which give us a pretty good idea of offensive impact. It's why O-BPM lines up much more with the 'eye test' than D-BPM, and since we're discussing offensive impact here, I think it's fair to use O-BPM, which gives a generally accurate view of offensive impact. 

I think AST% was a much more drastic outlier than TOV% when comparing his first years of his career against all other seasons. I don't have a problem with you contextualizing his TOV%, I just find it weird that you didn't do the same for AST% when it was a bigger outlier. In general, I think it's far better protocol to compare a time period which better represents who he currently is as a player playing at the 5 against his two seasons at the 4 (which is what I did when I took the period between 2019 and 2022), and doing so would still yield a clear increase in TOV% and decrease in AST%, and I did indeed include his first year playing with Rudy when I brought up the 19.4% v.s. 17.3% which did in fact inflate his AST% (from 15.1 to 17.3). 
> If it were true that his offensive potency drops, you would expect his seasons at the 4 would be his absolute worst seasons, which they are not.

Aside from 2021, they are in fact his absolute worst seasons. He's played 10 seasons in the league, and has consistently posted rTS of over +6, yet 2 of his 3 worst seasons are the only seasons he played at the 4. Does that look like 'natural fluctuation'? Even if you only take the +4.5 from his second season with Rudy, it still doesn't come anywhere close to the +6 he consistently posts when playing at the 5. It's not higher than 'some' of his seasons at the 5, it's higher than precisely one season - out of 8. Note that him not playing many games in the 2022-23 season has already been weighted in the numbers. You may think it should be weighted even less due to the circumstances which is entirely fair, but even ignoring it completely still shows a clear difference - 23-24 is the second worst season (3rd worst if including 22-23) of his career in terms of efficiency, with no other season coming even close (within 1.5%). 

I don't think team ORTG is a good way to look at a player's impact on his team offense because it's affected by 10 other players on the team, and I understand you were pushing back against the same idea, which I do agree with. I simply don't think the explanations for his team offense being worse hold up - from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/18v72in/a_correlation_analysis_between_pace_efficiency/) post, there was a 0.02 correlation between pace and ORTG for the 2023-24 season, and a -0.26 correlation for the 2022-23 season. Two anecdotes don't change that. The point about transition offense is fair, though I'd argue that KAT playing at the 4 directly contributes to a worse transition offense - you have fewer players that can push the pace. 

I don't think you can explain the marginal changes in AST% and TOV% with 'standard fluctuation'. A lot of fluctuation can be explained by change in role. In this case, we're comparing averages over 4 seasons and 2 seasons - that should be more than enough of a sample size where the effects of variance are minimal. Plus, KAT has been remarkably consistent in those aspects, most notably TOV% where he had 4 straight seasons between 13.2% and 13.7%. To see that number suddenly jump to 15% and 14.1% doesn't seem like natural fluctuation to me. Same with AST% - he's been constantly above 17% since 2019, but it dropped to 15% in 2024. That's best explained by a shift in role imo. And those differences aren't the largest, but they're not insignificant either, and it all adds up. Increases in AST%, decreases in TOV%, increases in rTS%, especially when you factor in the offensive rebounding, it all contributes to his offensive impact. 

I agree he's best at the 4. What I don't agree with is the idea that his current production and offensive impact will maintain with him at the 4. Most likely, we'll see a significant drop. All of this isn't an indictment on KAT whatsoever: (perimeter) players simply become better offensively relative to position when asked to slide down, because the average center isn't as valuable as the average guard on offense. There's better spacing and better ball-handling, and that opens up a lot. In KAT's case, attacking from the perimeter (his FTA/100 has also seen a rise at the 5). We saw it happen with LeBron a couple years ago. KAT isn't immune to this. The issue here is moreso his inability to play the 5 in playoff settings, where he gets hunted on defense. That means it is kind of a 'KAT offense at the 5' v.s. 'KAT defense at the 4' situation, where I believe the defensive tradeoff tends to be better in the playoffs. || If your takeaway is that KAT only fits as part of a top tier championship contender if he's the 4 in your starting and closing lineup I agree.

The problem is when at the 4, he plays like a borderline All-Star, and he's getting paid like a perennial All-NBA player. || I tend to disagree with the idea that one playoff year like last year proves KAT is not a bad player in the playoffs.

His play off numbers always drop compared to his regular season, given the amount of money he’s on even as a second option he should be be able to step up when others are struggling, look at the Celtics last year where jaylen brown was incredible in both the ECF and the finals. KAT is yet to have a moment like that in his career, hopefully the change of teams resets both him and Randle who both have these playoff struggles. || A player like JJJ or Giannis truly would be the dream partner for KAT. Lowkey, even somebody like Brook Lopez who is a good rim protector but can still space the floor would be pretty solid."

>  are we supposed to believe one back up Center is going to elevate them as a contender for the East?

He's only a ""backup"" because KAT is an All NBA quality guy. MR's rim protection and domination of the offensive glass (23% ORB) against Allen and Mobley was a huge reason the Knicks beat the Cavs in '23; he was easily their 2nd best player with Randall shitting the bed.  No guarantees he'll be as impactful after over a year of rehab but at best yes he might make them competitive with the big two in the East.

> Mikal Bridges has posted a -22 and -23 +/- in back to back games against the top seeds in the East.

A one player tiny game sample (n=2) AKA no one should give a rip. 

On the other side of the small sample coin:  Tatum, DWhite, Jrue, Horford, Mitchell, Allen and Mobley have combined for over 80% TS against the Knicks this season.  If anyone thinks that will hold up over a 7 game series, their 401K is probably all in meme stocks. || The thing people keep missing about the Knicks team this year vs last year is how big of a deal Hartenstein was for them. He flowed so incredibly well with everyone - 'metal bats', if you will. As a Knicks fan, I felt like the month we had ALMOST everyone healthy after the OG trade was the best i've seen a Knicks team since the 90s. Brunson at the 1, Donte at the 2, OG at the 3, Randle at the 4, and iHart at the 5, plus Josh Hart off the bench as the swiss army knife - that team punched you in the mouth; no way they'd lose by 40 to this amazing Celtics team or the incredible Cavs, because they physically wouldn't allow it.

Flash forward to this year and its easy to see how much of that 'metal bats' identity we've lost. No question KAT is a better player in a vacuum than both Randle & Donte combined, but he is just not the bruiser that they are - and far far cry from iHart, whom he is effectively replacing in his role at the 5 now. On top of this, Bridges has looked very apprehensive this year. He seems to be avoiding contact, passes up layups more often than I can count, and isn't fighting through screens. Again, in a vacuum he's better than someone like Donte at their position - but he isn't going fight the same way, and sometimes that's what the team needs.

I'm still happy we're having the best season we've had in like 25+yrs, and I am still holding out hope that MitchRob comes back with bionic legs and a ferocious tenacity like we haven't seen in years, pulling it all together - he is MUCH better when healthy than 'a backup center', OP; the dude led the league in offensive rebounds at one point, and is one of a very players on the defensive end that can slow down Embiid - but I am also not exactly looking to bet on him elevating this team to the point where we can beat Boston/ Cleveland. And it sucks, because this time last year I was honestly thinking 'I seriously think we can beat anyone', and now I'm like 'yeah, we're definitely a 3rd place team'. Hope someone smarter than me can fix it all soon || [removed] || [removed] || If any other team tried trading for Mikal the Nets would've been fine with two 1sts.

Their failure to add a back up five before the deadline will end the season early. || I have no idea what they can do about it but bridges has been absolutely invisible, particularly in these last few Celtics games. I forget he’s playing for long stretches, he seems to have no clear role in the offense, and he’s not the defender he was.

OG might round into form but Bridges seems lost || Honestly the biggest issue with this team is the inconsistency from Bridges but also the lack of bench depth and the obvious hole left in the middle by Mitch. Sure, they presented this team as a contender in the offseason, and sure, it is a fine team they built, but idk if we ever were contenders. || Thibs does this to his team every year. Injuries plus exhuastion plus all other teams kick it up to a new gear and they slowly become less effective. || We all knew, that OG at 4 spot was not going to be sustainable for the whole season.

Also, as great as KAT is playing this season (# 5 on the MVP list), he needs a big (at least 6'10) next to him to help him on defense.   

 Once MitchRob comes back, we will have the proper roster line up to fit Thibs defensive scheme (Mitch, Karl, OG, Mikal, Jalen). || Yes, they do have matchup problems against those teams. But to be fair, one of the losses to the Celtics was opening night when the Celtics got their rings, were bringing back their entire championship roster, and the Knicks had a brand new lineup on the floor from last year.

We'll see what happens in the 2nd round against Boston, assuming they don't get bounced by the Pistons first lol. || Thibs said Mitch will start at the 5 once he’s back, I think KAT at the 4 will solve a lot of defensive issues for the Knicks. He’s a bad rim protector and fouls too much, it’s no wonder this seemed to alleviate once he and Gobert figured out how to coexist || There isn't a path.  We fucked up this build by failing to secure iHart's Bird Rights when we signed him snd blowing iur asset load on an average NBA starter who hasn't been an elite defender in two years.  It'll take eayy too long for us to realize it (if we ever even do) but the best move now is to sell high on our players and pivot to a true rebuild.

There is zero chance of us catching up to the top 3.  They are all both better now and better equipped to develop and improve.  The worst teams on the league are more competitive with us than we are with them. || [removed] || Glad the bucks got a win against OKC so we don't have to sit next to those loser Knicks || That lineup will never be elite defensively if Thibs continues to play drop coverage and give shooters so much space. Their 2 biggest competitions in the east are the cavs who shoot the highest percentage from 3 and the celtics who shoot the most 3s. They hardly even look competitive against either of these teams because their defense let's the cavs and celtics get everything they want despite having some pretty great individual defenders. I think it's a scheme problem || The twin tower lineup is a nice option to have and could be the difference maker in some matchups but I think the main value of MR is that, unlike Precious or Sims (RIP) or Hukporti, MR is actually good at something important that KAT isn't.

- 2nd team all nba in 2023
- Likely 1st team all nba this year.
- Best guy on a team currently on pace to win 68 games this year

There's a pretty good chance that the Jazz don't get a player better than Mitchell from tanking or the trade return they got back for him.

The current Cavs clearly have a better supporting roster than the Jazz did, but the 2022 Jazz on paper seemed to have had the ability to build a good team around Mitchell (I'm not a Jazz fan so lmk if I'm wrong here, but I always did think it was weird of Ainge to blow up the team so soon) and were only 1 season removed from being the 1 seed in the west.

They could have kept their DPOY level Gobert to continue anchoring their defense - or use the massive return they got from the Gobert trade to retool around Mitchell. The Jazz also had a young Nickeil Alexander-Walker at the time (didn't know that until today, thought it was a cool fact) and most of their own FRP to trade to improve the roster.

5. Luka was a quite a lot better than Mitchell at the time of the trades. Mitchell was “just” a solid all star with the jazz, not an all nba/mvp candidate caliber player || Only similarity is the age of the players imo.

Luka is unquestionably better at 25 than Mitchell was at 25.

Utah was imploding, Mitchell was going to ask out, and Utah decided to blow it up after failing to make any noise in the playoffs after many attempts.

The Mavs just made the finals and arguably got better in the ensuing off season. There was every indication that the Mavs were set up to be a contender until Kyrie got too old or retired. 

Reporting indicates Mitchell wanted to be traded. Luka likely wanted to retire a Mav.

Utah blew it up. Dallas made what can charitably be called a lateral “win now” move. 

The situations are not at all comparable, but yes Utah arguably gave up on the team too early.

There were so many rumors for so long with that. Imagine if Luka had had rumors for like 2 plus years he was gonna leave and sign with the Knicks or Heat.

The mavericks had great team chemistry, went to the finals last year and the WCF 2 years before that.  Neither team had any business getting past the 2nd round and no other player in the league, save jokic and maybe lebron, could have taken them as far as they did go. || The Cavs aren’t winning a championship with Mitchell as their best player. He’s never going to be a #1 I don’t think they gave up on him too soon the team went as far as they could go without a true #1. || yeah the rift between Gobert and Mitchell is also different from the chemistry the Mavs have.

They're just two professionals who see each other as colleagues and their interaction as purely business so we don't see the drama. || Keep in mind as well, the locker room was collapsing because of Lukas playoff dominance over them lol

It's crazy that Luka's dominance over Western teams in the playoffs have led to multiple team re-tools (jazz, Suns, wolves) || Yeah, hindsight, the Mitchell trade was overdue for all the reasons that were mentioned. Plus, they peaked. The Jazz weren’t getting any better and the West was beginning to get more and more competitive. They never stood a chance and they knew that.

The Luka trade has to be the worst trade in recent majors sport history. Idk (and, quite frankly, don’t care) what was going on between Luka and the Mavs (specifically Nico), but they literally sold their future for nothing. Luka is a generational talent. He has given that organization the most success they’ve ever seen outside of ironically another non-athletic ultra-talented European. He just took them to the finals last year, been a consistent MVP caliber player for the last several years… and they threw him away for what?

All they have to show for it is an injury-prone mentally fragile aging superstar (respectfully AD) and a player I can’t even remember the name of, and *1* future pick. They didn’t even get multiple, they only got *1*. Mavs need to be investigated, because that trade made no sense; the only rational explanation is sabotage. 

If you tried inputting that trade in MyLeague, 2K would actually crash cause the trade is so illogical. 

I’m not a Mavs fan, but I truly feel for them. The entire city of Dallas has every right to feel the way they do right now. || The nba also didn’t just get spanked in the ratings by the nfl necessitating they prop up their marquee franchise with a bogus trade."
Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2025-04-04,nbadiscussion,1jrea75,2001-02 Seattle SuperSonics - Most top heavy playoff team of all time?,"I came across the statistics of the 2001-02 Sonics team ( [https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SEA/2002.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SEA/2002.html) ) and it struck me this team was essentially 3 players carrying the team all season to the #7 seed in the West.

**Gary Payton** (in his last season in Seattle) and **Brent Barry** had VORPs of **5.9** and **5.8** respectively with **Rashard Lewis** contributing a **3.2** VORP. Everyone else on the team had a VORP **below 1.0**.

By comparison, the championship Lakers that year, which were extremely top heavy as well, had **Shaq** (**6.1**), **Kobe** (**5.2**), **Horry** (**3.0**). Top heavy, but actually slightly less so than those Sonics. They had players with VORPs above 1.0. The LeBron Heat teams which are another obvious candidate had other contributors with VORPs above 1.0 as well outside their Big 3.

By comparison, this season, only 3 players in the entire league have VORPs above 5.0 - **Jokic** (**9.1**), **Shai** (**8.6**), and **Giannis** (**6.0**). The next closest is **Tatum** at **4.6**.

I looked for teams this year with at least 2 players with a VORP at 3.2 or above and saw these 5:

* Thunder: Shai (8.6), Jalen Williams (3.2)
* Cavaliers: Jarrett Allen (3.5), Evan Mobley (3.3)
* Celtics: Jayson Tatum (4.6), Derrick White (3.3)
* Knicks: Josh Hart (3.4), Karl-Anthony Towns (3.3)
* Bucks: Giannis (6.0), Damian Lillard (3.2)

By the end of the year, the Rockets may have 2 players qualify (Amen Thompson is at 3.1 and Sengun is already at 3.8) and the Cavaliers may have 3 (Mitchell is at 3.1).

Not a single team this year has 3 players with a 3.2 VORP or better though. And every playoff team has contributions with VORPs over 1.0.

  
Does anyone remember this Sonics team? Statistically, they had a better Big 3 than the championship Lakers and the #2 contender Spurs. In fact, Payton and Barry seemed to be a better big 2 than both Shaq and Kobe and Duncan and Robinson. But they got little contribution elsewhere outside Rashard Lewis.",52,14,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jrea75/200102_seattle_supersonics_most_top_heavy_playoff/,2025-04-04 11:12:30,"Man, I loved that team. Don't forget Desmond Mason and Vladimir Radmanovic coming off the bench. Probably my favorite team ever just because I used to get to go to so many of the games. You could get tickets for $10.

That’s way more top heavy || The [2008 Cavs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2008.html#all_advanced) had a total team VORP of 9.7 and Lebron had a 9.8. LOL, let that sink in. || You know Vorp is a good stat when 2002 Gary Payton and Brent Barry have similar numbers to Shaq and higher than Kobe. || 2021 Wizards have to be up there. In terms of VORP, Beal and Westbrook were 3.4 and 2.9. Everyone after them was 0.5 or under. || When we look at top heavy team and how top heavy they are.. we look at their best players rankings towards the rest of the league.

For instance KD and Curry top 5 players with Dray and Klay top 25 guys is top heavy.

Nobody cares about VORP || A lot of good examples here (those 08 Cavs are nuts).

I'll shout out the 19-20 Lakers, with Danny Green coming in 3rd with a vorp of 1.1. This team took being top heavy all the way to a title.

https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2020.html || 2008 spurs.

the reigning champs had the problem that they took too long to transition between the inefficient duncan led offense to a efficient ginobili led offense, parker won the fmvp and wants a larger role but he is simply not good enough. duncan is out of his prime, ginobili has 2 years left, parker has not entered it yet. the team is not constructed for the necessary change, instead they stick with the old players and to stagger the parker minutes they keep bringing ginobili from the bench.

the team looks like this, only 6 regular players average at least 20min

Duncan (31) 34mpg **VORP 4.8** BPM 5.2 **TS% 54**

Parker (25) 33mpg **VORP 2.6** BPM 2.4 **TS% 54**

Ginobili (30) 31mpg **VORP 6.0** BPM 8.0 **TS% 61**

Bowen (36) 30mpg **VORP 0.4** BPM -1.4 TS% 52

Finley (34) 26mpg **VORP 0.8** BPM -0.6 TS% 51

Oberto (32) 20mpg **VORP 1.0** BPM 0.4 TS% 61

they finish 56-26 only 1 game behind the 1st seeded Lakers. in the playoffs they reach the WCF but fall to the Lakers 1-4. Ginobili was dealing with an injury that made him lose his speed and elevation the entire run and the old guys could not rise to the level.

this is a good example of a typical playoff-build team, and why they fail. playoff teams need a sixth man kind of player to shake things up when things like injuries happen.

this season to me that team is the warriors. they look good for the last 20 or so games but in the playoffs it is very likely that if they can advance they will start dealing with minor injuries and it doesn't look like they have that Poole type of player like the last time they won. || Was it Vlad Radmanovic with the braids or was it the year after? || I think the '76 Lakers might edge them out with Kareem posting a 9.1 and the entire team going for just 10.2 ('22 Nuggets at 12.4 total).

Donovan Mitchell,"""Donovan Mitchell"" OR ""Donovan"" OR ""Mitchell""",2025-04-04,nbadiscussion,1jrdwn9,2024-25 All-NBA Teams Based on Average Ranking Across 8 Popular Advanced Metrics,"I was curious as to find a way to compile multiple advanced metrics to see if any consensus could be derived about the All-NBA teams this season. I am no mathematician and I do not know much about statistics, so I just decided to take some time and find the answer to the easiest question:

*What is the average rank for each All-NBA eligible player across multiple popular advanced metrics this season?*

This was more for my personal curiosity. I do not claim that this method actually has any validity or importance, but I did the work so I thought I would share.

**METHOD:**

*stats collected on 4/3*

To do this I referenced the 8 following advanced metrics that I see commonly used:

EPM, EW, LEBRON WAR(LW), RAPTOR WAR(RW), DARKO DPM(DPM), PER, WS, and VORP

I decided to include both EPM and EW because I think EPM is the best advanced metric so I wanted to give it some extra weight.

In order to compile the list of players best deserving of All-NBA recognition, I first went through each advanced metric for this season and gave each player a tally for an appearance in the top 20 in each of the stats.

I ended up with a list of 23 players who appeared in the top 20 in >3 out of the 8 stats, who are also likely to meet the 65 games played requirement. I had a few players that surprised me, but generally speaking it aligned with my preconceived idea of who was in contention for All-NBA recognition so I decided to roll with it. The only notable omission was Cade Cunningham who appeared in the top 20 in only 2 out of the 8 advanced metrics. Due to his narrative and likelihood of achieving All-NBA recognition, I included him.

Here are the 24 players:

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

Nikola Jokic

Giannis Antetokounmpo (Likely)

Jayson Tatum

Evan Mobley

Donovan Mitchell

Tyrese Haliburton

Ivica Zubac

Stephen Curry (Likely)

Darius Garland

Derrick White

Jarret Allen

Anthony Edwards

Karl-Anthony Towns

Domantas Sabonis (Likely)

Alperen Sengun

James Harden

Jalen Williams

Josh Hart

LeBron James

Tyler Herro

Jaren Jackson Jr.

Jalen Brunson (Likely)

Cade Cunningham

In the following table, I list each player with each of their respective RANKS in each advanced metric. This is not the metric itself, it is just the RANK in which their metric lies in comparison to their peers. 14 in the table means the 14th best number in the league for that respective stat.

At the end of the table, I include two averages. The first average is their average rank across all 8 advanced metrics. The second average (AVG(IMP)) is their average rank across the 5 all around impact metrics (EPM, EW, RAPTOR WAR, LEBRON WAR, and DARKO DPM). I believe these metrics to be different in kind to the others, so I wanted to see their averages separately.

**NOTES**

\-Haliburton being so loved by advanced metrics definitely surprised me given the narrative about him earlier this season. I would be curious to see his metrics if he can put together a full season of consistent play. Advanced metrics understandably love you if you push pace, generate great looks, and rarely turn the ball over.

\-Derrick White being so beloved by advanced metrics was not necessarily surprising, but the fact that it was enough to rank top 15 in this group of players is impressive. He is the epitome of a winning player.

\-While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated. I believe he deserves a lot more love for his performance this season(DPOY anyone?).

\-LeBron, JJJ, Brunson, and Cade not ranking well is definitely not what I expected going into this. Most of the conversation around these players land them in Second Team at worst and I have even heard arguments around these players to claim the 5th First Team spot.

This likely means nothing to most people, but there may be a few sickos who find this interesting.",292,44,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jrdwn9/202425_allnba_teams_based_on_average_ranking/,2025-04-04 10:56:58,"I have long thought Zubac criminally underrated but this HAS to be the most surprising result.

**Edited** to mention their extremely great health this season has a lot to do with it as they're all eligible for these honors. || I did that a while back and was really surprised how each metrics have their clear bias baked in yet top 4, r guys seem to be all unanimous. Like EPM favors offensive usage, LEBRON favors players that fit well into winning teams, DARKO really favors establish stats, etc. but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context. These metrics are really helpful to find out underrated role players, but for stars, they can be extremely misleading. || It’s crazy that the Cavs best player isn’t even one of the 4 in this analysis  || Very interesting perspective, thank you for sharing!

Zubac is a beast || Interesting stuff. Thanks for gathering this data and breaking it all down. Unfortunately, I think you're right that due to media narrative, there is no chance Brunson and LeBron get left off, and it's likely that Cade and JJJ will make it. Although those guys have all had very good seasons so it's not like it will be a travesty for any one of them to get the nod.

Zubac has almost no chance, as deserving as he is (I've been very impressed with him in the few clippers games I've watched this year) and White and Allen will likely miss the cut. I'd love to see Allen make it. The guy is such a great two way player and he's so unselfish on offense. He really makes the Cavs a much better team. || Jarrett Allen and Ivica Zubac ranking #3 and #4 in win shares is an indictment of that statistic.

> While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated.

I agree with the first part of your statement. But given that reality, why are you then trying to use these insignificant statistics to draw conclusions?

Zubac and Allen have roles to play and they play them well, but role players don't deserve to be ranked ahead of guys like Brunson or Cunningham who have far more difficult burdens to carry. || Why would you base it off metrics nobody uses?

Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil.  They’re useless.  

Obviously this isn’t how the teams are selected.  

Harden hasn’t made an all nba team in 5 years and he’s not going to make one over LeBron, who was the February player of the month and 5th on mvp ladder. || [removed] || Ultimately, the players are very close in a lot of these metrics so one good game or bad game down the stretch could vastly change the calculus for this analysis. 

  
For example, Ant had a good game last night and EW updated so now Ant is up from #10 all the way to #5. This alone would likely push Ant firmly into second team if I were to re run the analysis. But as of 4/3, these were the rankings. || Before Kawhi started playing like Kawhi, I thought Zubac was easily the most important Clipper. And for a team that was projected to be a lottery team to have a shot at 50-wins, that's Hella impressive || PER notoriously overweighs rebounding, so bigs pretty much always have higher PER than guards of similar quality. TBH it's a very flawed advanced stat that shouldnt be included in any analysis including this one imo. || The hate towards him was crazy. The people that were saying that haven't actually watched him play in a meaningful amount. He is the best pure creator in the league, hands down. His three point shooting, while streaky at times, is upper echelon. His defense is improving significantly as he gets more experience. He has moved to being a solidly average defender, when he was often a genuine liability in the past.

He still catches hate from people who like to make similar arguments against him that people do for John Stockton. It's baffling to me that people attempt to make straight faced arguments against these players because they make a high volume of ""easy assists"". You are seriously going to hold it against a player because they are capable of coordinating an offense so effectively, that they are able to very consistently get good shooters open shots, in spots that they shoot particularly well from? That is a testament to their ability as a creator, not a detrimental attribute. || The irony about the ""one good month"" thing is that it's really one bad month that tricked people. He was All-NBA last year and will likely be again this year. He had a bad start to the year but is putting up historically efficient numbers. It's basically him and prime CP3 in terms of this combination of scoring and assist volume + efficiency. Nobody else in NBA history has done this. || It’s the same story around the current MVP debate. For a huge amount of NBA fans, box score is the only value you bring to a team. Offensive output, advanced metrics, film, team success, none of it matters compared to that box score that you can glance at for five seconds and determine how valuable a player is. || The reality is that Allen not being worthy of an all-star this year is mostly a numbers thing, getting four players in is pretty ridiculous given how much talent there is around the league. But having watched most of our games this year, I think it's debatable that he's even our fourth-best player, especially if you consider his defensive impact. He's also the type of player to be underrated by casual/occasional viewers, because he does a lot that doesn't show up on the scoreboard. || >but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context.

Do these metrics underrate these players or are you just over rating them? 

Harden, Herro, and Cade all have good advanced stats. They all carry fairly poor offences || Yes, the biggest reason for this is that none of these stats measure on-ball defensive attention drawn and the benefits that it leads to for other players on the team at the risk of deflating counting stats of the player drawing the attention.

Making open looks as the 3rd/4th option on your team and ending up with a high TS% does not make a player better than say a Cade Cunningham or Donovan Mitchell.

It’s similar to how Ayton had distinctly better advanced numbers than Luka in their rookie seasons along with strong box score numbers at incredible efficiency yet anyone watching knew he was Ayton was a play finisher role player on a fully firing suns team and Luka was the entire Mavs offence. || 2025 is certainly the year of our Lord Tyrone Jerome. || What makes Zubac a role player? He's averaging 17 and 13 playing 33 MPG while anchoring the Clippers' defense. He's contending for the most important player on the team right next to Harden and Kawhi. || > Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil. They’re useless.
> 
> 

Publicly available defensive metrics, absolutely. There's basically zero value in those.

Publicly available overall metrics are solid. The vast majority of basketball value comes from offense and we can measure most of that. It's imperfect, but it's a very good way to determine who's in the ballpark. || My understanding is a lot of these stats weigh a bunch of counting stats heavier for centers than other roles -- which is OK up to a point because maybe a center getting an assist is more valuable than a PG doing the same, but it's hard to know. PER people who know seem to generally perceive as antiquated, right? || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || As someone who doesn't watch much Indiana or Charlotte basketball,  I'm really curious how Haliburton and Ball compare now. And to a lesser extent, Ant.  
Thinking back, man, that was a really fun draft class. || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || It's so weird, he was an all-star and top-tier playmaker an entire year on the Pacers in 22-23 season. His second half of the season in 21-22, when he was traded to the Pacers, was also really really good. His shooting averages have been good his entire career. ""One good month"" people are trolls or need to have their eyes checked because all you need to do is watch 48 minutes of the Pacers and you'll see him constantly trapped and doubled _at the logo_ and instead of playing hero ball he swings it because someone will be open, whether it counts in his box score or not.

But it's no surprise, average basketball fans are really really stupid when it comes to elite playmakers. Jokic was clowned for years and now pretty much everyone recognize how incredible he is. I wonder, what is the difference between now and years before? Ring finger, that's it. || Wouldn't models that include plus/minus stats account for this? Even if you don't necessarily generate an assist or made shot, if your ""gravity"" is actually opening things for teammates and contributing to winning it will show up in the plus/minus."
