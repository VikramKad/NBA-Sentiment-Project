But Khris trade? Brook? Bobby?

Listen, it’s clear the Bucks need a retooling. Stay in this boat, we win some and our veterans get old, then the Bucks have a very good Giannis who will likely ask for a trade. 

The assets acquired from a Dame deal could help build a future where Giannis has a genuine contender around him in Milwaukee

I seriously doubt that anything big will happen until the off-season though.

Is there another major trade on the way? What do you guys think. If you think I’m crazy let me know. I know I’m being reactive, but it’s clear we just aren’t a top-team anymore.

You aren't trading Dame Bobby or Brook for anyone better than them and bucks can't aggregate salary, and have no picks. || You make it sound like a Dame trade is an easy thing to get done, should the Bucks FO decide to go that way. 

Dame Makes $48mil this year. That’s nearly impossible to trade in season. So then we are talking about an Offseason move where Dame as a 35 year old small guard is making $54mil. You’re gonna need a team that 1 even needs a PG, 2 wants to commit to resigning him, & 3 somewhere Dame wants to be seeing as he could just opt out or say he won’t extend. 

Who even wants/needs him? Say MIA still has interest, is Tyler Herro & Duncan Robinson with a draft pick worth the downgrade? Probably not. That doesn’t make Giannis happy. Does UTAH revisit their rumored Dame Interest? Probably not if they finish bottom in the West. 

Outside of that I can’t think of a team who is begging to trade for Dame. Most are set at PG or can’t justify the salary matching/asking price he would cost. || You did not ask the main possible outcome. Giannis asking out of Milwaukee - it’s bound to happen at some point. || Lol if we ever do, we’re still stuck with Doc Rivers. That’s the biggest issue. Plus, with what assets? Nobody trading for aging stars, nobody’s trading for Dame (because who wants that albatross contract in exchange for a red flag player who wants out when he’s not given a championship roster?). || What assets are you getting for dame? Why do you think he has much trade value? He's an undersized 34yo guard who  is atrocious defensively and is coming off his worst season.

No rebuilding team will be interested in him, so the only chance to trade him is to contenders. But contenders aren't going to give up good contributors for him. They may offer worse players and draft capital, but that just ensures Gianni's is going to leave || The problem is every Bucks asset is on their lowest point for the last 4-5 years. What could they get for Dame, Middleton, Brook or Bobbis that is better than these guys? They also don’t have picks to trade and are over the 2nd apron so a bunch of trade restrictions apply.

Even if you think about some weak moves like trying to swap Dame with D’Lo + picks, making the salaries work would be a challenge. || Bucks are in the second apron, Dame has 2 years at over 50 a year left on his contract, he's more or less untradeable. You'd have to match salaries to move him and any team with the salary to do it, likely isnt trying to acquire a 35y/o point guard who's showing signs of aging. Maybe you find a suitor for him if he agrees to opt out of his player option to get moved but for him, that would basically be like setting 50 mil on fire. They can't even attach picks to move him with. 

Khris Middleton kind of reminds me of Dray on the warriors, his value to the team is greater than his market value, whatever you got back for him likely wouldn't be as impactful as just having him on the team, that said I could see teams being interested in him. I could see the Pacers, Hawks, GSW maybe even Cavs making a move for him but idk if you'd get much back in return. 

Brook Lopez I think you'd have a good chance of moving too, I think the Knicks would happily take them if you're willing to bet on the health of Mitchell Robinson.

Portis, I could also see getting picked up at the deadline by a contender looking to consolidate their roster. 

I think you could probably manage a pretty quick rebuild and be competitive again within the next 2 seasons, but idk is Giannis onboard with throwing away 2 years of his prime to let you guys catch up (that said it would be pretty good timing, you start to contend right as Boston starts to run into the sand) || It's 3 games into the season with 2 new starters for now. Everyone looks like they are giving minimal effort as well. There is no big move to make either, they are all in for a chip. || Their past suggests they won't ever go into a full rebuild even if they scrap their current roster (or are forced to, hi Giannis) || The Bucks are in “checkmate”. There is no big move for them to make. They are stuck where they’re at until they accept that they’re overdue for a full rebuild. 

Even if they trade Dame, the haul won’t be anything special. They’re not getting a difference-making player in return for 34 yr old Dame. || It’s unlikely. The time to make trades is during the draft and at the beginning of free agency. The Bucks are over the second apron so they can’t aggregate salaries in a trade. They don’t  have the flexibility to work out a big trade.

The best they can do is trade Portis or Connaughton while attaching a first or some seconds. However there’s only a handful of players that make similar money and are available. || Bucks keep losing <--- we are here

(Totally not biased) || [removed] || They have been pretty aggressive in the recent past, so I suspect that will continue. || I think it stands to reason that they wait for at least one fully healthy playoff run before they even start to think about blowing it up, main reason for the underwhelming performance being health - physical and mental.

Of course they need luck in their side but they have a capable roster and they also have some pieces (Dame) that could prove to be quite tricky to move. || They can’t aggregate salaries. All they have left is a 2031 first to trade. But really, what could you do with that? That first + Middleton (if he’s not going to be effective this year) could get you Jerami Grant. Does that really make you better?

Ditto for a Dame trade - who is going to send you back a better player or players for Dame? He’s making $48 million right now. Would the Lakers do a package of Russell, Vincent, and Hachimura plus a first? I’m not sure if that improves either team’s championship odds.  || Yeah trade Doc theres no way a team with Dam and Giannis should make some noise || How do you trade for better players? Most teams want draft picks or young players or individuals on bargain contracts. The Bucks have none of that.

Bucks future draft picks

2025 first round draft pick to New Orleans or Brooklyn
2025 second round draft pick to Cleveland
2026 first round draft pick to New Orleans (swap, New Orleans incoming)
2026 second round draft pick to Orlando or New York
2027 first round draft pick to New Orleans or Atlanta
2027 second round draft pick to Philadelphia
2028 first round draft pick to Portland (Portland incoming)

2029 first round draft pick to Portland or Washington
2029 second round draft pick to Detroit
2030 first round draft pick to Portland (swap, Portland incoming)
2030 second round draft pick to Orlando.

Dame is not gonna bring back a player of equal reputation given his monstrous contract which has years left to run at $50 million or more per season.

The nuclear option would be to trade Giannis. Probably to OKC as they have the most picks and they might need someone of Giannis’s size going up in future years against Wemby.

The Bucks seem to have little quality depth and no guard or wing that can erase dynamic guards on the opposition (like Jrue used to do!). 

I think it’s possible if Dame or Giannis miss much time the Bucks might not make the post-season.

If the Bucks sack Rivers then they’ll be paying three head coaches at the same time! Not a mark of a well run organisation. || It was supposed to be a big 3, but Middleton is cooked AFAIC. The best ability is availability, and sadly he seems to just always be injured.

IMO they should have kept PJ Tucker and Jrue Holiday. I think they definitely backpedaled by letting those guys go after a championship. I understand if it was business but you just hate to see it.

Their roster is really a bunch of misfits. It’s like when you  are 4 seasons in to a 2K MyPlayer and all the teams just get jumbled up with the ugliest rosters from simulated trades and signings lol || Should've never fired Griffin, doc made this team drastically worse and now you don't even have the pieces necessary to overcome his bad coaching. Can't wait for giannis to leave dude is wasting his time their. Every move they've made has been a the wrong one post championship  || If the lakers, heat, cavs, etc would be willing to take dame I think that’s the best bet. It’s sad to see that we might be looking at another 50 year gap…… Bud and Jrue should never have been moved and now it may be too late. If nothing happens this year it might be time to rebuild || They need to hit on trades and nail the buyout market but it’s definitely possible. It’s not like Dallas gave up a lot in their retooling which eventually lead to a finals appearance || [removed] || If you want Giannis for life, no.

The NBA salary rules are built that way. They have to trade that piece to re-build effectively, or you ride it until the wheels fall off. || Assuming you mean a trade to make them better this year then I doubt they do anything.  There are just not a whole lot of moves available, so the real question is who would you want them to go get that you think would be first, available, second fits their cap and third actually makes them a better team.

Honestly I think it's more likely they sell if they're still struggling half way through the season, if they're willing to move Dame or especially Giannis they can probably stack picks and young guys to try and put themselves in a position to become competitive again when the Celtics  have to start resigning everyone in 4 or 5 seasons. || The team is cooked man you have doc and ham as coaches no move will save them || So what comes next? Dwell in 3rd-8thseed with lackluster playoff ambitions, having the second best player in the world?

I find it hard to imagine they don’t try something. || After Miami scooped up Rozier? I doubt it. I think Miami's main focus now is to get like wing defenders and depth or a backup PG. Rozier ain't Dame, but value wise, that was a better trade. 

When Milwaukee traded for Dame, It was like , that wasn't their real plan. That was just to prevent Miami from getting Dame. They should've kept Holiday and focused on the 2 guard spot. Now, they're stuck with Dame. Which isn't necessarily bad, but it could've been better for them had they not panicked. They also have cap restraints. 

Miami won't jump on that after picking up Rozier.

I really don't see it either. The Bucks will be with him. || All good points || If things continue in this way it is only natural. Which is why I assume they’re going to not stand complacent."

It then turns into an entry pass and 4 guys standing around watching him try and post up a guard on the block. Been that way for the last three coaches. || I think Giannis needs to realize that a guard switching on him in a pnr might mean that dame also gets a mismatch and to trust him to make the right play || I’ve called this out a lot here: Giannis is at his best when used like Russ— attacking with the dribble from the top of the key. His awareness of action and reading the game are basically non-existent. He’s *brilliant* scoring in his preferred use, but is mostly useless on offense off the ball. To be clear, I rate his as a top 3 player right now, but he gets there through incredible talent, despite basketball IQ deficiencies. 

Lopez or Bobby screening for Dame or Middleton? Easy money. Those pairings check all the boxes. || Giannis refuses to play a different way and help Dame at all…he has not and will not evolve as a player almost to a fault || He was setting normal screens at the Olympics so either he is

1 Scared of setting good screens for 82 regular season games because someone will run into his knees and will turn it up in the playoffs 

2 He's been told to slip them often to draw away the double team on Dame

3. He doesn't want to pick up extra offensive fouls because to set good screens they have to be illegal in the NBA with better screen navigators than the Olympics || This is why it annoys me when ppl say it’d work if it was Steph. No, the problem isn’t Dame it’s Giannis. Dude doesn’t know how to set screens, he’s always just in attack mode. The defenders focus on Dame because he’s the immediate threat from outside so Giannis always goes downhill instead of working to get Dame open.

Giannis’ screens are hilariously bad, like 99% of the time he doesn’t make any physical contact with the defender because he slips too early. He set some good ones to start yesterday’s game and then fell back into old habits. The Dame and Brook pnr is amazing tho because Brook is an amazing screener. Giannis can’t set screens but I think the duo can still be elite using DHOs. || Alright well based on these few responses it sounds like they’re better off not using Giannis as Dames main screening partner. I understand that somewhat, I know Giannis going to the basket leads to good offense and so he wants to slip and attack. feels like leaving so much potential in the trash tho… || I dunno, but I agree and I'm also concerned the same will happen with Brunson and Kat in NYC. 

Like, I'm no pro ball player, barely played many full court games, but goddammit it's not that hard to set a convincing screen. I just don't get it. It's like guys are afraid of the contact, or they're too eager to get the ball back or something. 

Thibs seems absolutely not interested in getting these guys to run good sets. Positioning is all over the place and it looks like each player is being told to go out and play hero ball. Both teams look barely good enough to make the playoffs and not much past that. || [removed] || I mean is it surprising though. Look at the number of possessions that Giannis has been a screener over his career. It's quite hard to change what you're not accustomed to doing. Having said that, this is the second season with Dame and that screening game should be much better || This is coached. They'd rather have him off ball cutting and mobile than stuck at the perimeter serving as a body. It's generally a waste especially considering there's no shooting threat from Giannis at the 3pt line once dame is free. There's a reason they use brook. Obviously giannis knows how to set a screen and from what I understand they would tell him if they wanted real solid ones. || they lost this battle already when they let him fire the coach and hire DOC...so || Doc Rivers is the problem. Why y’all hired him as a “consultant” and then hired him just to torpedo the entire season is beyond me. But y’all deserve it. He will blame literally anyone and anything except himself || I used to think this was a Bud problem, got to the point that I was sure Bud was a horrible coach and cost them games and celebrated when he got fired. But now that he's gone it's obvious that this is just how Giannis plays, and doesn't appear to be willing to change it. I understand him wanting to take advantage of that mismatch, but he also has to be willing to try different tactics more || Yep. It's entirely a Giannis problem 

Gianni's sets a screen looking to score every time || Pretty much. His greatest strength on offense is playing on-ball as a gigantic guard. His greatest weakness on offense is playing off-ball as a middleweight big man. || This is why Bud literally put circles on the floor for where guys should stand on the 3pt line. That way Giannis knew exactly where they were and didn't have to improvise. This is also likely why Doc wants Dame to run the offense. I don't think we would have ever won a title without the bball IQ of Bud, Jrue and PJ. || He so capable of making some incredible highlight pass given his dexterity and length but the guy has never been a floor general, yet all this time when it comes to player comparison people still have him above Tim Duncan/ Kevin Garnett/ Kevin Durant in terms of play making.. other than raw assist per game stat his play making skill is certainly not better than those names above. || Just 3 years ago I had people telling me Giannis has great basketball IQ. No his biggest strength is his physicality and…I’m sure some other things. || I like Giannis and he’s an undeniable great player, but it has been obvious as a non-Bucks fan for a while now that he just refuses to evolve. Honestly, if he figures it out it’s worse for every other team so I hope he doesn’t. || Good point in the offensive fouls, I haven't heard this point yet.  I would counter it with he would get away with it a lot like Bam does but he would have to start setting a lot more screens.  I think he would still average at least one illegal screen foul per game though. He's also going to get 1-2 charges a game as well as 1-2 regulars defensive fouls a game.  I could see him averaging close to five fouls a game but the star treatment would maybe offset that. || It’s probably 2.
And probably he sees that creating two mismatches for him and Dame is a good idea. But he kinda clogs the lane for Dame, and if he doesn’t get an entry pass the whole offence fizzles out. 

I really think he would be better in those sets as a lob threat. || This might fit with number one or might be a separate point. He's a naturally skinny guy who has bulked up. He's also used to having the ball going back to his youth. It's completely different than the guys who are bigger than him or have always been big guys - Lopez, Portis and Nurkic - and have set screens forever during their career. 


I think all your answers are good. On three, I think the Greece coach had his respect and could get through to him better than his NBA coaches. 


There are also times where Dame doesn't set up the screen very well or turns it down and Giannis gets blamed. 


I've also read complaints of him not getting contact on the Bucks sub where he slips the screen, Dame makes a nice pass, and Giannis gets dunk. That's just ridiculous. 


I think it's an overrated problem. He played ten years before Dame got there and no complaints. Now it's a problem?  || Honestly I think they’d be fine if Giannis would delay the roll slightly then wait for big to switch on to dame then dive for the lob over the guard and behind the big. If he posts up the guard it turns Into a double team off of either Prince or Brook Lopez. Giannis isn’t good enough as a passer or a post player to make that work efficiently. || My guess is that all of these players grew up as the undisputed #1 option of their team. Meaning that screens were set for them, not the other way around. 

But that should be only for guards, not big men. || It's always weird to me how many professionals don't seem to know how to set a screen well, or how to run off a screen well either. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || He had a delayed cut last night and it was a wide open dunk. I’ve watching every Bucks game for the past few years and feel like I’ve seen that like 5 times total. || He can roll to the rim after setting the screen like any other screener would do || I’m a Celtics fan I just don’t like watching bad bball"

They were pretty bad defensively last year and got another year older. 

Their roster arguably got worse overall. They're currently starting Taurean Prince and playing him like 30+ minutes a game. He's been a 10-20min off the bench guy his whole career.

Dame and Lopez are currently cold from 3. They have no spacing because of that and teams are able to wall off Gainnis. 

The roster has probably run its course and the whole thing should be blown up. || Their perimeter defense is horrendous. Giannis and Lopez are their only plus defenders, and Lopez can be neutralized by stretch bigs. 

They’re also old. 

Jrue made everybody, and especially Giannis’, defense a lot better. He used to be able to roam while Jrue and Middleton could funnel people into him. 

Now it’s pretty much all on Giannis defensively, and he can’t sustain that for 48 minutes. 

Middleton coming back should help a little, but he’s not the player he once was after all the injuries the last few years.

Also they’re just older and slower. Dame and Giannis don’t have great chemistry, and their bench is not good outside of Portis, and he can be streaky.

But mostly their defense is just bad, and that’s really hard to overcome. || Watching Giannis and Dame play together looks like the trade happened yesterday. No chemistry at all between them || The change they needed to make is stop making changes, especially on head coach. Instability and lack of continuity is what’s actually hurting this team. If you keep changing schemes every half a season, everything is going to look disorganized. The blame starts at the top with the owner.

They should’ve kept Mike Budenholzer, and then kept Adrian Griffin as next best move. || [removed] || Was Dame really an upgrade over Jrue?

Their perimeter defense is asscheeks now. And take a wild guess which top perimeter defender they sent out to get Dame? 

Offensively, Jrue was inconsistent, but Dame is inconsistent as well. Jrue's defense, especially against the opposing backcourt is elite as well.
If they struggle scoring, Jrue has elite defense. Dame, like now, he's 1-12, contributed nothing to the defense. Ja dropped 26, triple double as well, on his head. 


On paper, Dame is a bigger star, but when you watch them, you'd go with Jrue. || If Dame can’t drop 30, they’re going to lose because he doesn’t bring anything else to the table. Bucks have to find a way to get him going. They just turned Dame into a spot up shooter because Giannis is playing selfishly || I mean, Bud is a much better (especially regular season, both have playoffs warts but) coach than Roc Divers. They got to the top with guys who are getting older, the schematic / playstyle advantages in terms of getting up a ton of threes / absolutely dominating the rim defensively are being ebbed away. They limited assets to improve, took a swing on an awesome offensive talent at the end of the window to try and pry open the Giannis window and it hasn't worked. 

Khris not playing yet matters too. || This what happens when owners caters to their superstar they fired a good coach to go get Doc! Smh then broke team chemistry to get Dame by trading Jrue and now there just older and injury prone.They fired Mike Budenholzer who got them the ship, then Griffin who when fired had them with a 30-13 record, Rivers is overrated and it shows. || Problem is that Dame cannot defend when his shots are not falling, his 120 defensive rating stinks. I think there is some issue too from what we can gather about Giannis and Dame lack of workouts in the off-season. Giannis has always been dominating as a point forward, he always has the ball in his hand and Dame has the same issue with the ball. I think they are butting heads hard plus they have a terrible coach in Glenn Rivers so unless they go back to their defensive identity by trading Dame, fire Glenn Rivers and get Adrian Griffin or somebody defensive minded back, then it's gonna be hard for them to win. || They need to actually run plays on offense and hustle back on defense/in transition to start.

Giannis and Dame can get to 60-70 points but the next 40-60 are very difficult for them to get. || Lack of chemistry between Dame and Giannis that wasn't solved this offseason, poor defense not letting them rack up easy transition buckets (https://x.com/JustEsBaraheni/status/1852173915876978870) , and a system that hasn't adjusted to any of these realities. || Whew where do we start? Their defense is horrible, specifically their POA. As soon as the opponent crosses half-court, their defense starts falling apart.  Taurean Prince is not a starting caliber NBA player and he’s getting 30+ mins. Trent is OK, but also not a starter. Delon Wright is an end of rotation player getting too many minutes. If Rivers is taking advice from Ham that’s a problem. Dame looks better than last year, but he’s still not Blazers Dame. He has it in spurts, but can’t sustain it for 35 minutes. They need Middleton back yesterday, but can’t rely on him to remain healthy all year. Then their bench sucks outside of Portis. And the entire roster is a year older with no quality additions this year.

Giannis will start the trade rumors and Rivers will be fired this season. The experiment is over. || I don’t know if Lillard was an upgrade. Numbers wise, of course. But Holiday fit their system so well. Middleton hasn’t played yet either. I don’t see them being top 2 in the East but they will get better.

Rivers is a terrible coach. 
Key guys are old and/or injured. 
Pretty straightforward really. I'm sure they'll have a hot stretch at some point, but this team isn't winning anything. || The Bucks were not contenders last year either. 
The injuries at the end of the season conveniently  bought them time from being heavily scrutinized, unlike the other teams who lost and weren't serious contenders. || > They upgraded at the PG position with Dame

They absolutely did not upgrade the PG position. I can't believe people are still undervaluing Jrue's impact after he was critical to yet another deep playoff run.

The thing people seem to have forgotten about the Bucks playoff runs is that Jrue was absolutely massive for them. He averaged 22/5/10 in the ECF in '21 as the 2nd/3rd option while playing elite defense -- Atlanta's 2nd option averaged 14.7 PPG. He outplayed that by a wide margin. In the Finals, he outscored Phoenix's 3rd option by 2.0 PPG, averaged more than 9 assists, and Booker was very inefficient all series.

Then when the Bucks got eliminated in the second round in '22, Jrue averaged 21/6/6. They lost in 7 with Middleton out the entire series. In '23 Giannis only played 3 out of 5 games in the playoffs, so they never really had a chance. Even still, Giannis went 1/9 from the floor in the 4th quarter of their final game where they blew a 16-point lead and lost in OT.

Point being... Jrue was never the problem there, and when they were winning in the playoffs, they were relying heavily on him on both ends of the floor. People underestimated his impact. So when they made the move for Dame, they not only had to overcome the defensive gap between Jrue and Dame, they also needed Dame to be considerably better than ~19/8 which is roughly what Jrue averaged during those playoff runs. Dame needs to be a legit 33-35 PPG scorer to do that and offset the defensive gap. Dame scoring like 25 in a playoff game is actually a considerable step down from Jrue because of the impact Jrue had elsewhere. || Did they upgrade the PG spot though? I feel like people act like they went from a scrub to Dame. When that’s just not the case. 

Jrue is one of the best defensive guards in the league & an above average scoring option. Dame is one of the best offensive guards while simultaneously being one of the worst defensive guards in the league. IMO It evens out pretty evenly, honestly I’d lean more towards the Jrue side in a “who impacts winning more” debate. 


Then remember MIL’s entire POA defense ran through Jrue, with hindsight the Dame trade gets more & more indefensible as the days go on. 

If it was all for Giannis to extend then that’s fine, but if so what can you really earnestly expect from this team? || They don't have enough talent. 3-12 their roster is old, can't defend and aren't great shooters. Dame is their number two guy, but he may be the worst defensive player in the league and he's an aging undersized guard.

They will get destroyed by any fast perimeter player. I'm watching last night's game now and my friend's 4-year-old son who's never watched basketball asked "" why is the guy in blue so much faster than the guys in white?"" Referring to Ja. Yes, ja is faster than almost everyone in the league but when a 4-year-old can watch him race by everybody with ease and notice it you know you have a problem, || They don’t have any defensive plan. No one knows their role for some reason (cough, cough coaching) so every shot ends up completely uncontested. Turns out mediocre teams can shoot a really high percentage if they are more open than when they’re in practice shoot around. || Tbh, they suck. Cant guard. No middleton. No ball movement. Can’t defend for nothing.

And I blame Doc rivers. || They could've traded Middleton for Bridges and Cam Johnson but they chose to bring Dame to Bucks. Now their defense has become worse. What they needed is a scoring wing not a scoring point guard and they traded the only perimeter defense they had. || How much do we factor in Doc Rivers being a reason as well? Everywhere he goes, his teams have a low ceiling, when it should be higher. || They are old. All the main parts are mostly aging vets.

Giannis is still in his prime but the other vets are on the backend of their careers. It’s an ancient team compared to knicks, Boston, Cleveland etc

Also think losing jrue holiday had a major impact on defense and overall team chemistry 

Bringing in doc rivers hasn’t gotten the intended results.

Still along way to go in the season, and I expect them to make playoffs. || Middleton hasn't been playing. Dame hasn't found how to optimally play his role. Giannis stat pads and Doc said the team hasn't found their identity.  || They are very similar to the lakers last year. Horrible coach now 2x with Ham. Horrible perimeter defense. Only positive defender is Giannis like AD was.  No team chemistry"

Like most trade packages is them giving up their entire depth and roster, who tf are you gonna pair Giannis up with then, you'll just be the Bucks essentially as an above .500 team or like the suns for the last 2 season if you trade for him due to how much you're gonna give up

The only teams that really could trade for him is OKC and the pelicans due to their assets and young players, but I don’t even think OKC really would do it unless they don’t have to gut their entire young core.

But for the Bucks really how would you even trade him, Portland and the pelicans owns your picks. They would have to find a 3 team deal which would not happen. And if they trade Giannis, they’ll also be trade Middleton  and Dame probably but who’s gonna trade for an injury prone player and a star who has  to play alone to be good.

It’s just somewhat of a lose lose situation right now",219,237,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1gmm4g5/should_teams_even_trade_for_giannis/,2024-11-08 11:10:31,"OKC has so many picks but would the Bucks do it for picks or would they insist on players coming back? Feels like Milwaukee holds the cards in that negotiation because Giannis added to last year’s top seed in the west would be crazy. 

There is no way the Bucks find a trade partner for Middleton, he has a 34 m player option for next year and anyone betting on his health should not be a GM. 

if they traded Giannis and maybe they could trade Dame (who played well alongside McCollum, so I don’t know about having to play alone) they’d be stuck with Lopez, Middleton, and a bunch of role players for a couple of years. Their better option is to fire Doc Rivers immediately and try anything else. || If any team traded for him, Giannis to the Rockets makes the most sense to me. Overflow of young talent and plenty of picks. || Giannis is just 29, has never played less than 60 games a season his entire career, was second in PPG last year. 

He also had the most efficient season of his career last year with a TS% of 64.9% which was basically identical to efficiency god Jokic (65%) while scoring way more points per game and had basically the equal highest TS% of any player in the top 20 in PPG which is insane considering he was 2nd in PPG. 

The other players who have multiple seasons close to the top on both charts this century are basically KD and Steph. 

He’s also an elite rebounder (11.9 RPG last season), one of the best post passers (6.5 APG last season) and still easily one of the top 10 standalone defenders in the world regardless of system. 

The idea that OKC would be worse trading Chet or JDub and a few pieces for him is insane. It’s like saying the Wolves would be worse with Jokic instead of Gobert because they would lose their defensive identity. || I think most teams shouldn't trade for Giannis. I'm a Pelicans fan, and I don't want them to trade for Giannis, but if there is one team equipped to trade for Giannis, it's the Pelicans.

We would send Zion, Herb, and picks for Giannis. The contracts (amounts and years) work out perfectly. The Bucks still have inside-outside with Dame/Zion. They'd have 1st team All-Defense perimeter defending Herbo Jones to play next to Dame. Zion gets to play next to stretch shooting big who plays defense and rebounds.

For the Pelicans, Giannis can pass the ball to Murray, CJ, Trey, Hawkins, and Ingram to shoot. Pelicans immediately shore up their rebounding issues, get some interior defense, and get a consistent go to scorer who has been MVP and won a championship. 

I think the team is capable of contending with Giannis. It would just be up to perimeter guys to commit themselves to playing defense. || I think him to the Nets would be cool. (I wanna keep the east competitive). But in all honesty there’s no easy way out. 

1. Fire doc rivers - now you paying 3 coaches… and the coaching market isn’t as hot as it was last year. 
2. Trade giannis - going to be hard to find a suitor and get back ‘fair value’. And you’re trading away your franchise guy
3. Trade dame - maybe you can work out a deal where you get back 2/3 decent role players for dame and this might be the best scenario. Clearly dame still has a lot of capability but he doesn’t seem to work with giannis (also j might be coaching)
4. Trade dame/giannis and commit to a full rebuild. I think you can get a decent haul but this would likely be an offseason move. 

I would like giannis to stay in the east. But the front office full fucked up by 1) firing bud, 2) trading for dame 3) firing griffin. Some of this blame has to land on giannis || My biggest point of contention in these discussions is the idea that the Bucks have the leverage. If the NBA has taught us anything in the last decade, it is that the teams have no leverage when a star demands out. It doesn’t matter how much time is left on the contract, or what the team demands in return. 

If Giannis wants out, he’ll get out. Milwaukee can play hardball and put on a public front for a bit, but ultimately they will concede. If OKC offers them there choice of the trove of first round picks, Milwaukee will take it. If New Orleans offers Brandon Ingram, three first rounds picks, and two swaps (hypothetically- I haven’t looked up what NOP has as tradable assets), they’ll take it. Eventually, they will make a deal. 

They’re a small market team who can’t afford to let a mega star walk for nothing, or to basement dwell when he sits out. 

If Giannis says he wants to play elsewhere, I think the best think Milwaukee can do is call up OKC and try to get the kings ransom, and find a contender who thinks they can squeeze another year out of Dame as a second tier option. I would do this sooner rather than later when you’re getting pressured by the fan base and media, because that’s when you start losing leverage.

This is all just my opinion, and I like to hear the opposing point of view. || You have to be a team that can pay the price for Giannis in picks so you don't have to trade all your depth pieces. Giannis is an elite player still - he averaged 31 PPG on 65% TS last year - but outside of Jokic there are no one-man shows in the NBA anymore. You need to have functional depth around Giannis: OKC and Houston seem like the only ones that make sense. But even OKC would probably balk because Milwaukee will insist on Jalen Williams, and I wouldn't do that deal as OKC. 

Honestly maybe the only team that could/should do it is Houston. With Adams, Jeff Green, Landale, and Tate and $18 million in room below the first apron, they could take back $45 million in matching salary without having to include any of their young guys. They could get to Giannis with just throwing Tari Eason in the deal, for example. That would then allow them to use Jalen Green's salary to trade for another star this offseason (like Durant or Booker.) || I'm sure lots of teams think they would be the best fit.  But the Pelicans are the best fit.

1.  They have two very important Bucks picks (and possibly 3 if they REALLY tank this year) that they can trade back.  That's immense value that no one but the Pelicans can offer.  Pels also have our own 1sts to trade every year.  Pels could offer Bucks own picks back in 2027, plus swap rights back in 26, Bucks pick back this year if it's a top 5 pick, Even if it's just salary back, Pels could offer like 5 1sts including 2 of the Bucks own picks

2.  They have easy salary to trade.  CJ or BI in expiring contracts.  A deal of BI, CJ, and picks for Giannis and Lopez works and fits.  Then Bucks could move CJ and BI for MOAR assets

3.  They have a young star they could trade in Zion.  Zion, CJ, and picks for Giannis and Lopez is another easy deal.  Teams like OKC and Houston etc have to put together a 4 or 5 for 1 player deal realistically. || Warriors should trade him. Owner is insistent on making one last run at it for Steph. We are deep. Can offload kuminga/moody and picks. Maybe podz. || When you get the chance to trade for a top 3 player in the league I think you have to at least try. Obviously it's not for every team as you need to match salary, give up enough for the Bucks to be willing to accept while also still being in a position to realistically compete after giving up the package. 

One thing that I don't think is considered enough is the Bucks basically have no control of their firsts until 2031. The Nets basically owns their pick this year, the Pelicans for 2026 and 2027 and then the Trail Blazers in 2028, 2029 and 2030. So if you're the Bucks you can't just straight up tank but also if you are trading away Giannis you also aren't competing either. I think what makes the most sense is to trade for young players and picks which then some can be sent to, in particular, the Nets and the Pelicans to get their picks back. The Pelicans are a bit more straightforward imo as they need a center with the Nets probably wanting general picks or young players. 

I know OKC is the common team that comes up but to me that doesn't make as much sense as in order to match the salary of Giannis and for future salary purposes they would have to give up JDub, IHart, Topic, Kenrich and Dieng which imo is already a lot of value to give up and if I was them I'd give up 1 decent pick and 1 other low value pick but that would probably be it. I think the team that makes the most sense is the Rockets, they probably don't have a number 1 guy right now and have a good amount of young players and picks to give up. To me what would make sense is getting Jabari, Tari, Brooks, Reed and then a few picks. They could then send Jabari and Brooks to the Pelicans for McCollum to gain control of their 2026 and 2027 picks, and then send Tari to the Nets to get their 2025 pick and so they be left with Reed Sheppard, their own picks back, a few extra picks on top and McCollum who they could look to flip as well. 

I know the Heat and Warriors have come up quite a bit but to me their packages aren't quite enticing enough, especially in the situation as I've mentioned where the Bucks will be needing to send some out to get their picks back. The Nets are a little interesting as they can basically do Ben Simmons expiring for salary and then just a massive amount of picks. The Spurs could make a package good enough but then I'm not sure how good the rest of that team is around Wemby and Giannis to compete. || He is almost untradeable because he's gonna want to go to a contender but to go to one they would gut said team for him so honestly he is best off where he is at. Unless your a team that literally is in win now and screw the future mode I don't see it. || If Milwaukee even considers trading Giannis that is a huge mistake in my opinion. You don’t trade players like him. || as much as okc can acquire him they should wait one more season and see how the core plays out. Their own players got even better.

Bucks should just fire doc and ham lol. Lillard and Giannis are still playing A
all NBA.

And try to trade for a couple role players.

Just make it highly competitive. || I think the Bucks are more likely to trade Portis than anyone else. I like the guy, but he's not been holding it down on the defensive end, and the on/ off stats are kind of atrocious.

Either that, or you just cut your losses, end the experiment, and trade Dame. I personally would still like to see them have more time to mesh, but I think the Bucks could get a much more meshable return than trading Giannis. || If the Bucks have a disappointing season and this could be missing the playoffs to losing in the first round then I think Giannis will be really considering asking for a trade.

The Bucks are a second apron team but will have cap space flexibility in the summer. Outside of Dame and Giannis the Bucks have very old veterans with Brook Lopez an expiring contract and Middleton, Bobby Portis and Pat C all have player options which they will likely pick up. 

The Bucks don’t control their draft until 2032. They have some first round pick swaps (other teams can swap with them if the Bucks are in the lottery) but no second rounders.

Giannis and Dame are both scoring a lot of points in recent games and have lost they aren’t getting much from the other players.

Trade destinations:

OKC has the most draft assets and several players they could trade but would they break up their roster and spend their vast draft equity on a player who is 30 next month and has suffered injuries precluding him from playing in the post-season in recent seasons?

Brooklyn has a huge amount of picks and cap space next summer. But many Nets fans will never accept Giannis in Brooklyn after he tangled unnecessarily with Kyrie as he was trying to land after he dunked in game 4 of the playoffs. This incident ended Kyrie’s season and meant the Nets were down to only KD from their Big 3. Together the Nets had a win % of .800 and were basically unbeatable with a healthy KD/Kyrie/Harden. 

Jordi Fernández, the new Nets head coach is taking the Nets in a new direction with a young core and lots of draft picks (currently four first round picks in 2025 alone). Brooklyn is not a destination for Giannis.

Possible other teams.

San Antonio Spurs. You could team Wemby with Giannis and Spurs have plenty of picks to trade to the Bucks to make it happen. Would the Spurs fast-track their title chase with Wemby? 

Houston Rockets. They have most of the future picks from the Suns and also their own picks and plenty of players to trade in exchange. The Rockets could use Van Vleet’s team option to make a trade happen.

If Giannis is to be traded then the Bucks need to trade Dame at the same time but Dame’s value is not what it was when he left Portland and he has $50 million per season for the next couple of seasons after this.

The Knicks seem to have taken themselves out of any Giannis trade by using their future first round picks on Mikal Bridges (six picks Mik) and trading for KAT.

Given the Pelicans have some of the Bucks picks Nawlins could trade for Giannis and return some of those picks. A Giannis and Zion on the same team could be devastating but both have injury concerns which could be ruinous if both are out at the same time. || I know it’s far fetched but I think the Mavs could do well trading for Giannis. Grimes, Washington, Hardy, Lively and Kessler and 3 firsts. You’re giving up a lot of players but I’d do it for Giannis. This gives Milwaukee multiple young guys and picks to rebuild. And Dallas goes into the playoffs with Luka, Kyrie, Giannis, Gafford and Klay as the starting 5. || OKC could def do it and not lose too much. I think much of it’ll depend on whether or not he has a list or if he just wants to win. No one can match their offer so we’ll just have to see if he wants to go there || Pelicans could do it with Ingram, Cj, and a bucket of picks. Rockets could ive sengun, vets for salary, and tons of picks. Timeline isn’t perfect there but I kinda want to see it || It's amazing that OKC has such a good young  top 5 team while also having the most assets over the next 7 years that they really may not even be interested in a generational superstar like Giannis. 

That said as a Spurs fan.. fuck okc || I think you may have forgotten some teams have some extra picks. Those teams might be more able to throw enough picks in they don’t lose too many valuable players though salary matching will take some. || This discussion comes up every time a top 10ish player is on the block. Yes he makes the core of the team exponentially better, but is it worth potentially decimating the rest of your roster and your future || So MIL priority in any Giannis deal needs to be to demand whatever team receiving Giannis Loops in NOP & to a lesser extent POR. They also need to realize if Giannis is gone then everyone is gone. A fire sale would need to ensue.  

We saw HOU & BKN set the precedent for giving back picks. HOU got essentially 4 FRPs to give BKN back 2 of their own. 

Maybe NOP demands 2 FRPs & a swap from X team to send MIL their 2027 pick back & relinquish the 2026 swap. Whatever NOP wants, MIL needs to tell X team you’re paying it. 

Who actually has a chance or should? 

OKC obviously has the trump card because they can beat any team’s offer. It’s just really a “do they wanna?” They’ve built something sustainable in a small market, this would take a lot of that away. 

Besides them, NOP & POR because they control MIL picks. NOP is prolly stuck In the same boat MIL is with Giannis, just kinda stuck fearing he won’t extend unless you go all in. POR makes zero sense outside of being able to give MIL control of their picks. 

I’d also say HOU has the young players to send MIL & the draft capital to send to NOP for the picks. They also want to make a big move. 

BKN has the picks & expirings to get something done, but would mean they do a complete 180 on their rebuild plan. Also means building a contender from scratch around Giannis, not impossible but also not easy, especially since theres a clock on it. 

Then you have the crop of MIA, NY, the LA teams & GSW who will offer deals, but likely get beaten out if any of the above teams wanted to get in the race. 

GSW is really the only team in that group that has a chance. But would involve a team viewing JK & PODZ as cornerstones. Problem for them is draft capital from a team with Steph & Giannis is not gonna be viewed as “good picks.” 

The rest of the league gets real hard with hypotheticals. || i feel like we’re overthinking this? giannis would 100 benefit teams like okc. having a rim runner like that makes your spacing even more lethal. you may not be able to run that 5 out; i still feel thst giannis presence at the rack deserves respect from any defense || If I was buck I’d flat out have w
Play his contract because the majority of Thisbe is his fault but teams will absolutely trade fur 2x MVP Nba champion || Do you know how bad some max contract guys are? You give up some picks if you are pick-rich team, and you can make the contracts work. || I think it could be worth depending on the team, he's being held down right now by an aged and injured roster and hes been playing great the last few years. You're right about the picks but if they were able to do it with a team that has salary issues it could work. Like the nuggets are really in trouble with their cap sheet. The rockets could be a good move as well since they're kind of overloaded with prospects so they could potentially trade young prospects which the bucks would want, and condense their diluted roster || The market is soley dictated by the stupidest team that is a valid destination. 

I agree with your analysis, and I’ll take it a step further to say with how trades have been lately, it is *impossible* to win a chip if you recently made a trade to get a top 10 player (or any blockbuster trade really). Bucks got worse for Dame, Wolves got better for Gobert BUT they had to Trade Kat since the financials were impossible to work with, Suns got worse for KD and then worse again for Beal… 

It just costs too much to get these guys and their contracts are too big to go get them extra help down the line.

You’d have to be a team with a RIDICULOUS amount of picks to send, a good young core, and some older and over priced player to make the money work. Its a very specific near impossible thing to pull off || Pelicans can easily make a Zion for Giannis move if they were serious about being competitive || I wonder if the Bucks regret trading for Dame. Not quite the same, but pretty close. || If it makes sense for them to go hunting for a trade then of course you bag a Greek freak lol. Every damn time 😂 jk but a few teams make sense and idk why but The Bulls popped into my head first. They have some stuff over there but I won’t speculate. I will however say Cleveland is primed to get into this mix. If youre Milwaukee you try to grab Mobley and change + picks. Then on the other end Dame goes to Miami and brings in Hero + and some picks and you’re in the Cooper Flagg business."

They could then send Jabari and Brooks to the Pelicans for McCollum to gain control of their 2026 and 2027 picks, and then send Tari to the Nets to get their 2025 pick and so they be left with Reed Sheppard, their own picks back, a few extra picks on top and McCollum who they could look to flip as well. 

I know the Heat and Warriors have come up quite a bit but to me their packages aren't quite enticing enough, especially in the situation as I've mentioned where the Bucks will be needing to send some out to get their picks back. The Nets are a little interesting as they can basically do Ben Simmons expiring for salary and then just a massive amount of picks. The Spurs could make a package good enough but then I'm not sure how good the rest of that team is around Wemby and Giannis to compete. || He is almost untradeable because he's gonna want to go to a contender but to go to one they would gut said team for him so honestly he is best off where he is at. Unless your a team that literally is in win now and screw the future mode I don't see it. || If Milwaukee even considers trading Giannis that is a huge mistake in my opinion. You don’t trade players like him. || as much as okc can acquire him they should wait one more season and see how the core plays out. Their own players got even better.

Bucks should just fire doc and ham lol. Lillard and Giannis are still playing A
all NBA.

And try to trade for a couple role players.

Just make it highly competitive. || I think the Bucks are more likely to trade Portis than anyone else. I like the guy, but he's not been holding it down on the defensive end, and the on/ off stats are kind of atrocious.

Either that, or you just cut your losses, end the experiment, and trade Dame. I personally would still like to see them have more time to mesh, but I think the Bucks could get a much more meshable return than trading Giannis. || If the Bucks have a disappointing season and this could be missing the playoffs to losing in the first round then I think Giannis will be really considering asking for a trade.

The Bucks are a second apron team but will have cap space flexibility in the summer. Outside of Dame and Giannis the Bucks have very old veterans with Brook Lopez an expiring contract and Middleton, Bobby Portis and Pat C all have player options which they will likely pick up. 

The Bucks don’t control their draft until 2032. They have some first round pick swaps (other teams can swap with them if the Bucks are in the lottery) but no second rounders.

Giannis and Dame are both scoring a lot of points in recent games and have lost they aren’t getting much from the other players.

Trade destinations:

OKC has the most draft assets and several players they could trade but would they break up their roster and spend their vast draft equity on a player who is 30 next month and has suffered injuries precluding him from playing in the post-season in recent seasons?

Brooklyn has a huge amount of picks and cap space next summer. But many Nets fans will never accept Giannis in Brooklyn after he tangled unnecessarily with Kyrie as he was trying to land after he dunked in game 4 of the playoffs. This incident ended Kyrie’s season and meant the Nets were down to only KD from their Big 3. Together the Nets had a win % of .800 and were basically unbeatable with a healthy KD/Kyrie/Harden. 

Jordi Fernández, the new Nets head coach is taking the Nets in a new direction with a young core and lots of draft picks (currently four first round picks in 2025 alone). Brooklyn is not a destination for Giannis.

Possible other teams.

San Antonio Spurs. You could team Wemby with Giannis and Spurs have plenty of picks to trade to the Bucks to make it happen. Would the Spurs fast-track their title chase with Wemby? 

Houston Rockets. They have most of the future picks from the Suns and also their own picks and plenty of players to trade in exchange. The Rockets could use Van Vleet’s team option to make a trade happen.

If Giannis is to be traded then the Bucks need to trade Dame at the same time but Dame’s value is not what it was when he left Portland and he has $50 million per season for the next couple of seasons after this.

The Knicks seem to have taken themselves out of any Giannis trade by using their future first round picks on Mikal Bridges (six picks Mik) and trading for KAT.

Given the Pelicans have some of the Bucks picks Nawlins could trade for Giannis and return some of those picks. A Giannis and Zion on the same team could be devastating but both have injury concerns which could be ruinous if both are out at the same time. || I know it’s far fetched but I think the Mavs could do well trading for Giannis. Grimes, Washington, Hardy, Lively and Kessler and 3 firsts. You’re giving up a lot of players but I’d do it for Giannis. This gives Milwaukee multiple young guys and picks to rebuild. And Dallas goes into the playoffs with Luka, Kyrie, Giannis, Gafford and Klay as the starting 5. || OKC could def do it and not lose too much. I think much of it’ll depend on whether or not he has a list or if he just wants to win. No one can match their offer so we’ll just have to see if he wants to go there || Pelicans could do it with Ingram, Cj, and a bucket of picks. Rockets could ive sengun, vets for salary, and tons of picks. Timeline isn’t perfect there but I kinda want to see it || It's amazing that OKC has such a good young  top 5 team while also having the most assets over the next 7 years that they really may not even be interested in a generational superstar like Giannis. 

That said as a Spurs fan.. fuck okc || I think you may have forgotten some teams have some extra picks. Those teams might be more able to throw enough picks in they don’t lose too many valuable players though salary matching will take some. || This discussion comes up every time a top 10ish player is on the block. Yes he makes the core of the team exponentially better, but is it worth potentially decimating the rest of your roster and your future || So MIL priority in any Giannis deal needs to be to demand whatever team receiving Giannis Loops in NOP & to a lesser extent POR. They also need to realize if Giannis is gone then everyone is gone. A fire sale would need to ensue.  

We saw HOU & BKN set the precedent for giving back picks. HOU got essentially 4 FRPs to give BKN back 2 of their own. 

Maybe NOP demands 2 FRPs & a swap from X team to send MIL their 2027 pick back & relinquish the 2026 swap. Whatever NOP wants, MIL needs to tell X team you’re paying it. 

Who actually has a chance or should? 

OKC obviously has the trump card because they can beat any team’s offer. It’s just really a “do they wanna?” They’ve built something sustainable in a small market, this would take a lot of that away. 

Besides them, NOP & POR because they control MIL picks. NOP is prolly stuck In the same boat MIL is with Giannis, just kinda stuck fearing he won’t extend unless you go all in. POR makes zero sense outside of being able to give MIL control of their picks. 

I’d also say HOU has the young players to send MIL & the draft capital to send to NOP for the picks. They also want to make a big move. 

BKN has the picks & expirings to get something done, but would mean they do a complete 180 on their rebuild plan. Also means building a contender from scratch around Giannis, not impossible but also not easy, especially since theres a clock on it. 

Then you have the crop of MIA, NY, the LA teams & GSW who will offer deals, but likely get beaten out if any of the above teams wanted to get in the race. 

GSW is really the only team in that group that has a chance. But would involve a team viewing JK & PODZ as cornerstones. Problem for them is draft capital from a team with Steph & Giannis is not gonna be viewed as “good picks.” 

The rest of the league gets real hard with hypotheticals. || i feel like we’re overthinking this? giannis would 100 benefit teams like okc. having a rim runner like that makes your spacing even more lethal. you may not be able to run that 5 out; i still feel thst giannis presence at the rack deserves respect from any defense || If I was buck I’d flat out have w
Play his contract because the majority of Thisbe is his fault but teams will absolutely trade fur 2x MVP Nba champion || Do you know how bad some max contract guys are? You give up some picks if you are pick-rich team, and you can make the contracts work. || I think it could be worth depending on the team, he's being held down right now by an aged and injured roster and hes been playing great the last few years. You're right about the picks but if they were able to do it with a team that has salary issues it could work. Like the nuggets are really in trouble with their cap sheet. The rockets could be a good move as well since they're kind of overloaded with prospects so they could potentially trade young prospects which the bucks would want, and condense their diluted roster || The market is soley dictated by the stupidest team that is a valid destination. 

I agree with your analysis, and I’ll take it a step further to say with how trades have been lately, it is *impossible* to win a chip if you recently made a trade to get a top 10 player (or any blockbuster trade really). Bucks got worse for Dame, Wolves got better for Gobert BUT they had to Trade Kat since the financials were impossible to work with, Suns got worse for KD and then worse again for Beal… 

It just costs too much to get these guys and their contracts are too big to go get them extra help down the line.

You’d have to be a team with a RIDICULOUS amount of picks to send, a good young core, and some older and over priced player to make the money work. Its a very specific near impossible thing to pull off || Pelicans can easily make a Zion for Giannis move if they were serious about being competitive || I wonder if the Bucks regret trading for Dame. Not quite the same, but pretty close. || If it makes sense for them to go hunting for a trade then of course you bag a Greek freak lol. Every damn time 😂 jk but a few teams make sense and idk why but The Bulls popped into my head first. They have some stuff over there but I won’t speculate. I will however say Cleveland is primed to get into this mix. If youre Milwaukee you try to grab Mobley and change + picks. Then on the other end Dame goes to Miami and brings in Hero + and some picks and you’re in the Cooper Flagg business."

I recently discovered that the NBA app on PS5 has the entire NBA finals catalog going back to 1990 available for streaming without a subscription, just your regular streaming ad breaks. Looking for recommendations of great single games to watch as I begin to digest some of the series I'm most interested in (I was born in 89 so I'm starting with the Jordan finals since I barely remember him playing).

Drop your recs, and a brief reason why, here please!

I'm not sure if I hit the 500 character minimum yet so I'll add my own submission: 

Giannis 50 piece to seal the Bucks title in 2021. Absolutely unreal domination in a critical moment. The block on Ayton to put the game away is just iconic. One of my favorite games as a neutral fan that I've ever watched, and I don't even like Giannis.

It might be the closest a team has ever come to winning a title without sealing the deal.  


It's one of those jawns where you rewatch it and still think the Spurs are going to win even though we know damn well what happened lol. || Game 1 2001 finals

AI goes berserk and beats the Lakers that entered the game undefeated since April 3rd (8 RS games, and all of the playoffs) || I’ve watched the first few finals on there and here were my favorite games from each series:

1990 Game 5 - Isiah’s insane 1st quarter sets the tone for the game but the Blazers fight back while facing elimination. It comes down to a game winning shot. 

1991 Game 1 - Another game that ends in a game winning shot, this match is the best Jordan v. Magic game you’ll find. Magic COOKED MJ but the lakers couldn’t really stop him either so it’s a fun one. 

1992 Game 1 (The Shrug) - One of MJ’s greatest performances, his insane shooting first half overshadows how amazing he was as a playmaker in the 2nd half. The game wasn’t really close but it’s a good insight into the Bulls’ dominance 

1993 Game 4 - MJ’s absolute greatest game imo, this is the only game I’ve ever hand tracked where a player generated over 70 points for his team. The Suns honestly might have played better as a team this game but they had absolutely no answer for Jordan. He’s too fast for Majerle or Dumas (as demonstrated in the previous games in the series) so the Suns switch KJ on him cause he can stay in front of MJ better, but MJ just began abusing KJ in the post || The obvious for me is 1998 game 6 of Jordan vs Jazz.

Really fun ones: 

2005 SAS vs Pistons game 5 (dont watch any spoilers if you dont know yet)

2010 game 7 of LAL vs BOS

2011 game 2 of DAL vs MIA || 2016 game 5, lebron and Kyrie each scored 41 points, LeBron put up 41/16/7, Draymond was suspended this game so there was some discourse around that. Then the next game (game 6) lebron goes for 41/8/11 and 7 stocks on 67% true shooting. Then, a triple double to close it out the last game. || I know it’s recent and probably the cliche answer but 2016 game 7 was electrifying. 

Game 3 bulls Cavs in 2015 was amazing aswell || A more recent one but game 4 of the 2022 finals. Arguably Steph’s best game of all time, down 2-1 and going absolutely nuclear in the garden. Iconic || I'm surprised nobody's mentioned 2018 Game 1, the JR Smith game.

That was maybe my favorite Lebron performance, an absolute masterpiece of later career high IQ bullyball. He put up 51/8/8 against one of the greatest teams of all time and came \*so\* close to beating them on the road. And then to end a game like that with such an iconic mistake makes it an extra good watch. || Game 1 of the 1997 Finals. 

Game 6 of the 1998 Finals. 

Game 4 of the 1997 Finals. 

Just extremely high level basketball from some of the greatest players ever on some of the greatest teams ever || Off the top of my head:

1993: Bulls Suns Game 3, went to triple OT, close the whole way. Prime Chuck and MJ, great supporting casts. 

2008: Celtics Lakers Game 4. Just mentioning it because OP appears to be a Cs fan. 24 pt comeback to go up 3-1. 

2005: Spurs Pistons Game 5. Tight, defensive struggle. Big Shot Rob massive finish into OT. 

1997: Bulls Jazz Game 1. These teams mostly played slugfests. MJ buzzer beater after Malone was presented MVP trophy. Definitely the best fist pump of all time. || 2013 Game 6 of Heat-Spurs. The series was probably the peak of my NBA fandom and it's one of my favorite ever. And this game is one that I can watch over and over even though I know the ending. 

Game 1 of the 2001 76ers-Lakers Finals is also etched into my memory. I was young but had this game on VHS, and as a huge Iverson fan watched it over and over and over. I didn't care what happened in the ensuing 4 games lol. 

Game 7 of the 2010 Lakers-Celtics was also particularly memorable. Kobe was bad that game but it was a gritty matchup of 2 great teams and the 2 greatest franchises ever. 

I didn't know they were available to watch on PS5. Glad you posted this cuz I'm definitely gonna go watch some myself. || 2014 game 3 is the best team offense that has ever been played. You also don't have to wait the whole game or skip ahead to get to the best part, as the offensive explosion starts in the first quarter. Trust me if you haven't seen this or don't remember, it was a work of art. The series was essentially over half way through the 2nd quarter. || Game one of the 2001-2002 Finals, the step over game. Iverson single handedly taking down the Lakers who were undefeated in the postseason will always be one of my favourite playoff moments. || 1993, Game 3. Suns with their backs against the wall in Chicago after pissing away home court. 3OT nail biter || Jimmy Butler. Game 5 of 2020 finals. Unreal. First player to ever beat LeBron in every major counting stat in a playoff game. This is where the iconic photo of him tired behind the basket came from. Literally carried them to a win and to avoid elimination || 2013 Finals Game Six.Spurs were ready to celebrate but Lebron and Ray Allen had another opinions.Gregg Popovich made his biggest mistake.(I hope him a full recovery from latest stroke.) Absolute classic. || Only saw one mention, but 2011 Game 2. Dallas down 1-0 in the series, Miami takes a huge lead halfway through the fourth and the Mavs made one of the all time Finals comebacks to avoid going down a pretty daunting 2-0 after how the first 7 1/2 quarters had gone. || 2019 game 5. Durant going red hot then going down with injury. Kawhi pretty much icing the game. Then the nick nurse timeout that killed everyone’s momentum. Then steph and Klay hitting huge shots down the stretch to save their season amazing game. || Pascal Siakim game 1 2019. 

32 points for the teams 3/4 option in his third year in the league and sealed the game with a nasty layup past Draymond. 

FVV game 6 2019

22 points off the bench and hounded Steph the entire games (and series). FVV should have won finals MVP that season. || Great to see so many replies! I would add 1995 Houston - Orlando Game 1 to the list. Shaq and Penny finally made it to the finals against Prime Olajuwon who was defending his title as only the second 6th seed to reach the finals. Game is very close with a couple of historic (good and bad) moments at the end of the 4th. || The first round Celtics/Bulls series from 2009 when KG was hurt and it leveled the two teams if absolutely freaking magical. Suns/Mavs the year after the Mavs let Steve Nash walk is freaking magic. Everyone and their dog will rightly say game 6 2016 and that whole series. Since 1990? Knicks/Pacers is absolutely fantastic. It's really just worth that. Game 5 Pistons/Cavs in 2007 is something people don't seem to talk about anymore. People don't like giving Bron credit as the best ever but like... yea... he is. Game 6 Boston/Miami 2012 is another one for Bron. As is Lebronto when he destroyed my raps. I saw that game live. I paid more for tickets for that than any other event in my life and felt just a sense of awe honestly. It was crushing as a fan of my team but I've never seen anything so spectacular from one individual competitor. Teh Giannis game isn't really all that. Hmm... There's a bunch of Spurs games too that are just incredible. A lot of spurs/suns. You need to find the ones Manu took over and witness his own greatness too. || Maybe not the best, but game 2 of the 1990 finals was really fun, even as someone who rooted for the pistons then. || Game 5 of 2014. It was fairly tight in the first half, then the Spurs went on a run to put the game away. The 3s from Patty and Manu were electric. || people will have their opinions of the bubble, but game 3 of the 2020 finals from butler was insane 40 point triple double to make it a series was something else

great piece of history || 2008 game 4 featured the biggest comeback in a finals game ever. Celtics were down 21 points after the first quarter and were down as much as 24, and went on a 23-3 run to win 97-91. || Watch all the 93 Finals 

Barkley won MVP that season and despite losing to Jordan, Barkley made it a fight. || Mj game 1 of the 92 finals.  It’s on youtube.  For those of you that maybe haven’t watched a full game of prime Jordan… do yourself a favor and watch it on a cold quiet day this winter.  Dude is playing a completely different game than anyone else. Sone truly incredible stuff. || Game 5 2004 Finals, Lakers vs Pistons. The atmosphere is electric and the Pistons just roll through the Lakers. 

Game 7 2005 Finals, Pistons vs Spurs. Manu Ginobli closes out the Pistons. It’s one of Manus greatest games in his excellent career, some would say he should’ve earned finals MVP over Duncan that year. 

Game 1 2012 Finals, Heat vs Thunder. A tale of what could’ve been. The OK3 take a 1-0 lead against Heatles 

Game 6-7 2013 Finals, Spurs vs Heat. These games are denoted by Ray Allen hitting one of the most important shots in finals history but don’t let it overshadow LeBrons defensive brilliance throughout this entire series and peaking in the final two games. I believe he was just shy of leading both teams in all major stats for the first time in this series. 

These are my off the top recommendations from this century. 

Game 6 1993 Finals Bulls vs Suns. Barkley and squad put up a valiant effort against the Bulls buzz saw lead by MJ. It’s a game that had everything. Stars put up huge numbers with role players making crucial plays. Considering the final two plays are made by Bulls players who are not MJ or Pippen shows entertainment value || Jordan and Shaq is going to take up about 80% of this. 

Jordan game 1 1992 Finals is my pick || Bulls Celtics, first round match up Triple OT game 6 from 2009, don't care that it was first round it was a crazy series and this game was incredible"

You need to find the ones Manu took over and witness his own greatness too. || Maybe not the best, but game 2 of the 1990 finals was really fun, even as someone who rooted for the pistons then. || Game 5 of 2014. It was fairly tight in the first half, then the Spurs went on a run to put the game away. The 3s from Patty and Manu were electric. || people will have their opinions of the bubble, but game 3 of the 2020 finals from butler was insane 40 point triple double to make it a series was something else

great piece of history || 2008 game 4 featured the biggest comeback in a finals game ever. Celtics were down 21 points after the first quarter and were down as much as 24, and went on a 23-3 run to win 97-91. || Watch all the 93 Finals 

Barkley won MVP that season and despite losing to Jordan, Barkley made it a fight. || Mj game 1 of the 92 finals.  It’s on youtube.  For those of you that maybe haven’t watched a full game of prime Jordan… do yourself a favor and watch it on a cold quiet day this winter.  Dude is playing a completely different game than anyone else. Sone truly incredible stuff. || Game 5 2004 Finals, Lakers vs Pistons. The atmosphere is electric and the Pistons just roll through the Lakers. 

Game 7 2005 Finals, Pistons vs Spurs. Manu Ginobli closes out the Pistons. It’s one of Manus greatest games in his excellent career, some would say he should’ve earned finals MVP over Duncan that year. 

Game 1 2012 Finals, Heat vs Thunder. A tale of what could’ve been. The OK3 take a 1-0 lead against Heatles 

Game 6-7 2013 Finals, Spurs vs Heat. These games are denoted by Ray Allen hitting one of the most important shots in finals history but don’t let it overshadow LeBrons defensive brilliance throughout this entire series and peaking in the final two games. I believe he was just shy of leading both teams in all major stats for the first time in this series. 

These are my off the top recommendations from this century. 

Game 6 1993 Finals Bulls vs Suns. Barkley and squad put up a valiant effort against the Bulls buzz saw lead by MJ. It’s a game that had everything. Stars put up huge numbers with role players making crucial plays. Considering the final two plays are made by Bulls players who are not MJ or Pippen shows entertainment value || Jordan and Shaq is going to take up about 80% of this. 

Jordan game 1 1992 Finals is my pick || Bulls Celtics, first round match up Triple OT game 6 from 2009, don't care that it was first round it was a crazy series and this game was incredible"

However, their 2020-2024 season are already done. So, we can rate it compared to previous decade's first 5 years.

For 21st Century:

**2000 - 2004:** Shaq/Duncan

**2010 - 2014:** Lebron/KD

**2020 - 2024:** Jokic/Giannis

How will you rank the Duo in each start of the decade? **Based on those 5 Years Only**

For me, I will go

1. Shaq/Duncan  (Both in their primes)

2. Lebron/KD (Lebron's absolute prime, But KD was Kinda Young Rising Star, though he won MVP in 2014)

3. Jokic/Giannis (They are both amazing. But I needed to make a had decision.)

I am certain of Shaq/Duncan. They are both winning FMVPs and MVPs almost in rotation those 2000-2004 Stretch.

The #2 and #3 are interchangeable. 

How will you rank them?",0,17,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1h5msjq/shaqduncan_vs_lebronkd_vs_jokicgiannis_read/,2024-12-03 07:57:30,"Are we rating it on purely hardware and accolades then it’s Shaq and Timmy > Jokic/Giannis and then LeBron KD for that time period. 

Are we rating it on which of those duo’s work best together in period then it’s pretty easily Lebron KD. || The first one. I am not playing the duos together.

Oh, interesting you have Joker/Giannis over Lebron/KD.

How about Eye Test? I mean accolades aside. Just their level of play. (Not as teammates) || Accolades KD & LeBron have 4 MVPs, 2 Finals MVPs , 2 Championships, , 10 all MVP first team, 4 all defensive first team, 2 all star game MVPs, 4 NBA scoring Titles tell me how they have more accomplishments then KD & LeBron || I mean it hard to rate Lebron and KD over Joker and Giannis for hardware when KD didn’t win a ring and Joker and Giannis both did. 

Eye test wise probably say Lebron>Jokic>Giannis>KD. Not entirely fair to KD as he missed a year and pace and space wasn’t really a thing at that time. 

I’d still pick Lebron and KD over the two for the eye test as peak LeBron was several tiers above everyone else. || You mean 5 MVPs lol right? || In terms of hardware, LeBron alone matches them in ring/FMVP count, and they're tied in MVPs with 4 for each duo. || How do you figure peak LeBron being ""several tiers"" above present-day Jokic? || In that timeframe? It’s 4 || Offence was elite for both. Jokic might even be a little higher. But defensivly there is no comaprison at all. Lebron in Miami was amazing defender, probably the best he ever was in his career. || Because whatever gap between them offensively is very minor at best and the gap between them defensively was about as wide as the ocean of not wider. No real argument for Jokic being on the same level as peak Bron. || You can't just remove his MVPs lol he already won them but I guess I do see your point it's about those peak years so nvm ignore me || Seems like Jokic is better on offense by a clear gap imo. LeBron was a much better defender, yes, but Jokic has proven he knows how to win and that his game is resilient in the playoffs.

I didn't say LeBron wasn't better. But to say he was ""several tiers"" better is wild. It's disrespectful to what Jokic has been doing for the last several years. || “But Jokic has proven he knows how to win” would be a great argument if we weren’t comparing him to one of the most winningest players to ever touch a basketball, at the height of said winning lol. They are, in fact, several tiers apart. No player after the 70s not named Michael Jordan is closer than several tiers away from peak Bron. That’s just what it is. It’s not disrespectful at all to say Jokic isn’t on the same level as the greatest player of all time lmao. || You think LeBron's peak is ""several tiers"" better than the peaks of Shaq, Hakeem, Bird for example? || >No player after the 70s not named Michael Jordan is closer than several tiers away from peak Bron.

This just isn't how tiers work. You're stating as if it would go:

**Tier 1** Jordan, LeBron

- gap -

**Tier 4** other people

When you construct a tier list, you fill them all in lol. Overrate LeBron all you want, you can't just change basic formatting standards || Now you’re being willfully obtuse and that’s where the conversation ends for me. || Literally not even close to the truth. What you said is simply not how tiers work. I'm genuinely curious as to how you would rank players' peaks, and also curious as to how you arrived at this notion that peak Bird/Shaq/Curry/Hakeem etc. are *that far* behind LBJ (if at all)."

Most would say his prime has lasted from the 2020/21season to the 2024/25 season. During this time he has averaged 32/11/4 with high level defense. 

His playoff appearances have brought lots of criticism, but is it deserved? His stats historically have dropped off during the playoffs, and from 2021-2024 he has averaged 27/10/3. However, each of these years he has dealt with - and played through - injuries. In 2021 it was a torn meniscus, 2022 an orbital fracture, a concussion and a torn thumb ligament, in 2023 a knee sprain, and finally in 2024 he was recovering from a torn meniscus while also playing through Bell's Palsy, which literally paralysed half of his face. And he dropped 50 POINTS during these playoffs. Amazingly, he has only missed 5 out of 41 playoff games during this period. People like to call Embiid soft for missing time due to injuries, but when it matters, he battles through. This would also explain the drop in stats, and in my opinion it can excuse it. 27/10/3 are still ridiculous numbers, he's hardly playing bad, especially for someone playing through injury.

Derrick Rose is every NBA fan who grew up during the late 2000s' darling. He is everybody's favourite 'what-if'. He, like Embiid, has had a career riddled with injuries which inhibited his playing time for most of what would have been his prime. During his MVP campaign, he averaged 25/4/7 at 22 years old, leading the Chicago Bulls to the Number 1 seed over LeBron James and the newly formed Miami Heatles. In the 2012 season, Rose sadly tore his ACL, breaking fans' hearts everywhere and causing him to miss more than a full season of games. When he returned in late 2013, he once again got injured. Right knee surgery would end his season prematurely, and after that, he could never recapture the heights of his MVP self again. In 2014/15, he averaged 18/3/5 on 41% from the field across 51 games. He would not be named an all-star again, despite a great 2017 season in New York. 

Some may point out that Rose has had a larger amount of playoff success than Embiid. Rose, in his 2011 playoff run, led the 1st seed Bulls to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they ultimately lost to Miami. Rose averaged a whopping 27/4/8, increasing his regular season totals. However, during these playoffs he shot sub-40% from the field, and struggled mightily efficiency-wise against the Heat in the ECF. 

Other player, who I won't go into as much detail in, like Brandon Roy, Grant Hill, Penny Hardaway and Bill Walton have been given similar sympathy to Rose for injuries robbing them of their prime. In contrast I see some more current players getting the Embiid treatment, for example LaMelo Ball, Zion Williamson (although his criticisms are more understandable), to a lesser extent Anthony Davis, and even Giannis Antetokounmpo recently. Instead of 'I wish injuries hadn't affected him', it's now become 'He shouldn't be getting injured'. Is it just a change in the way we view injuries in present times? Or is there another reason?

I'm somebody who used to be a Joel Embiid hater, and even now I wouldn't call myself a big fan. Despite this, I would absolutely love to see one fully healthy 76ers playoff run. While I may not think Rose would've become the best player in the world in his prime, I still do wish we could've seen him play a lot more. I'm really curious to hear others' thoughts on this, is it just a nostalgia thing or do people have a different reason for this.",196,408,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hbs2db/why_doesnt_joel_embiid_get_the_same_treatment_as/,2024-12-11 07:10:20,"Thread is locked because all productive discussion has been had, and the thread has devolved into petty fighting. || A dumbed down answer would be that Rose was objectively fun as hell to watch. On the other side there are MANY people who really can’t stand watching Embiid’s style of play. I’ve seen the guy go entire quarters basically trying to only draw fouls. Not fun to watch. || Embiid can be dirty at times, and has a whiney but nasty attitude. Also let's be honest, most of the sub hates his playstyle, and the petty fouls he tries to get called on him. On the other hand, D Rose was never a dirty player, always play the game with simple passion, and his playstyle was exciting to watch. Also to add, D Rose arguably could've been a top 10 PG all time if not for the injury, many fans reminisce on how special he was, and he's always remained real and humble as a player. || Great points made in here, and I'll add one. 

DRose's game was lightning in a bottle. Incredible athleticism and explosiveness paired with unique skill... and every time he got injured, it felt like a tragedy, knowing it is increasingly unlikely to get back to his former state.

For Embiid, the chances of him recovering from  injuries to play a reasonable facsimile of his current game seems higher. || [removed] || The difference in FTA. Derrick Rose's career high in FTA was 6.9, and his injury history was often blamed on his ability to *avoid contact* in the air to get a clean shot but leading to bad falls. Joel Embiid's career *low* in FTA is 7.4, and his injury history is often blamed on being a huge clumsy oaf that's as awkward as possible. 

While I might be a bit harsh on describing Embiid's game, I think it comes down to different play styles. Nobody likes or hates them *because* of their injury history, so there's no reason to really think they'd be appreciated similarly. || It’s narrative. Rose was a young, fun guard bringing life to one of the most prestigious NBA franchises that everyone revered because of another fan favorite in Jordan. Seeing Chicago back on top was an exciting storyline.

He was also the biggest Eastern threat to a unanimously hated Heatles team - Rose was the guy everyone rooted for to stop them. Like a babyface in wrestling, if you will.

Those older players were all extremely well-liked as well. Walton and Hill were kind souls with historic college careers, they were naturally rooted for. Penny helped lead a marketable and fun Magic team headlined by a major face in Shaq. Roy signified a shift away from the awful Jail Blazers era, which many fans appreciated.

Embiid’s lack of empathy is in part because NBA fans today are far more heartless on average, but he also doesn’t do himself any favors. The hate is overblown sometimes, but he’s rubbed people the wrong way with dirty play and complaining to the media about M.V.P., among other things. Those behaviors create a vocal following of haters. || He is incredibly skilled. But his play style makes me want to punch something and stop watching the NBA. || [removed] || i’d say it’s his mentality. he can be a dirty player at times and the way he plays is sometimes really agitating. it seems like he’s always ready to blame the refs or his teammates for his losses and he stay flopping and crying. drose also plays whenever he can… meanwhile… || [removed] || Embiid has all the talent and physical attributes possible, and he uses it all to essentially fall down in various manners. WHEN he locks in and just plays basketball, he’s great, but with everything else that comes with him, including his obnoxious style of play that is really only possible because of how the game is reffed nowadays, he’s just not a likable guy. || Reading the comments I can’t help but wonder if I’m the only one who likes Embiid’s playstyle? I truly think think his mastery if the midrange and post is beautiful to watch. The free throws never bothered me that much. || I think it’s pretty simply. 
Rose won an early MVP, threw down dope ferocious dunks, and played hard ALWAYS. 
Embiid just plays soft - misses games, lives at the free throw line, flops, complains to refs constantly etc. || I’ll never like Embiid because I will never like players that the refs hand free throw after free throw. I didn’t like Harden for the same reason. It’s not basketball and it’s blatant favoritism that we can all spot in real time. I’m not going to waste my time watching refs giftwrap a legacy for someone with padded points. 

That aside, anyone who wasn’t impressed by him last year against the Knicks when half of his face was literally frozen stuck, and his leg was fucked up, anyone not impressed by that doesn’t deserve sports. Even though I can’t stand him, I respect him a gracious plenty after that. I was actually looking forward to this new-look team they were bringing in to this season before everything went south. 

As far as why he doesn’t get D Rose treatment, I’m about to piss some people off. D Rose has a weird cult-like following of people with an underdog complex. His ultra loyal fans who genuinely thought he was an all star at any point in the last 8 years, and think he would’ve been better than Steph, those kids are always weirdos. You can’t compare him to Rose because nobody else has a fanbase that strange. If that pisses someone off, sorry, but this needed to be said. D Rose stans are on a totally different planet. || IMO the main reason for rose, penny, broy being more liked is simply because people love unrealized potential. They were able to show the beginnings of potential superstardom without any of the failures.

Embiid on the other hand is being looked at through the lenses of reality which is often disappointing.

Case in point, I remember a couple years ago when the Ben Simmons hype train was in full effect. When  everyone still hoped he might develop a jump shot and leap into superstardom if he did. Now imagine if he had suffered a career altering set of injuries shortly after going head to head with bron. If he had regressed to where he is now he would be talked about as a what if player that went head to head against LeBron in a game and won without a jump shot. ""Imagine if injuries hadn't robbed him of his prime"". || I sense something darker here than Joel merely being a complainer with an arguably ugly style. 

Like, what, players aren't human beings who complain about things and play dirty all the time?

Luka was the biggest complainer in the league, and that didn't stop him from being one of the most ""glazed"" individuals (undeservedly, but, eh, them different standards sure are something). Obviously, he is an offensive monster, but that's only one-half of the game. 

I think if Embiid was more like Shaq, you know, willing to be a clown, then he'd be more accepted. As it is, being that big and not making a fool of himself makes him threatening to everyone IMHO. || Derrick Rose was a gym rat maniac who got derailed by injuries.

Joel Embiid is a whiny child who's too irresponsible to take care of his body, so he gets injured and is always out of shape. 

These things are not the same. || wait. does a hometown hero, youngest MVP, and quiet, normal guy get better treatment than an angry foul baiter with injury history and a cranky attitude??????? || Derrick rose, Brandon Roy, Penny Hardaway and Grant hill were incredibly talented and all could have been considered top 10 in the league before they were 24 years old. They were only derailed by injuries. 

Embiid has an unlikable personality with his flopping and crying for mvp. Embiids game isn’t pretty either, he gets most of his points from the freethrow line and he settles for jumpers far too often. Embiids strength coming out of college was supposed to be his footwork and post play, instead he learned to flop and settles for long jumpers. He’s underperformed and has left too much potential on the table. || Embiid literally tried to injure the center on the Knicks in the playoffs last year. While he was on the ground, he tried to yank the dudes leg. Might have been Mitch Robinson || His attitude is fucking awful that's why, Derrick rose had catastrophic injuries embiid just had a lot of smaller stuff that has accumulate. You never really could say that rose didn't want to play really but with embiid I don't think he really cares that much || Joel Embiid did one of the dirtiest plays in the 21st century when he grabbed Mitchell Robinsons ankle and twisted it because he was frustrated.

Used to like Embiid.

Now, I will forever hate him. Dirty player, shit mentality, lazy. || people don’t hate embiid because of his injury proneness, they hate him because he’s a flopping, whiney baby. you don’t see people hating kawhi, despite being just as injury prone. || I think the people dont like Embid thing is more of a Reddit and social media thing than anything.    Narratives on players take on a life of their own in these spaces and people just hop on that narrative. 

I don't see the same hate for Embid in real life.   Part of it is that I believe Reddit has so much love for Jokic.     

Last thing is that players like Rose were not in their prime during a social media age like we are in now so they don't have the detractors.    

I don't mind Embid but I really don't get that vested in disliking players because os style of play or anything like that.    Unless you commit crimes or do harmful things to people off the court, I am pretty level headed about players || People don't like Philly sports teams and they don't like great players who score a lot through foul drawing. Even though Embiid's main method of drawing FTs, using the rip-through move, is something guys like Kobe and MJ did, Embiid is 7ft so it isn't seen as ""fair"" despite being a basic basketball move every high school coach wants their players to try and do. The media saw that Joel was disliked and decided to run with the narrative that he's resting games on purpose, despite 0 evidence for it, because hate gets clicks. || A lot of it is honestly due to the echo chamber effect of online. They see people praise Derrick rose and they do the same. They see everybody mock Embiid and they hop on, because it is funny. 

Online people see Embiid constantly hurt and clown him for it, rather than acknowledge that it’s incredible he ever played in the first place. The navicular fracture he had coming out of college is often supposed to be a career ender, and Embiid had that before his career ever even started. 

People will cite free throws, which I understand he definitely will fish for. However, every superstar in the history of basketball has done this. Dwyane wade was a master of foul baiting, as was Kobe, as is Giannis and shai currently. But nobody ever uses that as a criticism for him. Embiid is also a bit of a ball stopper which is not aesthetically pleasing. But I think if you’re a real hooper you can really appreciate his arsenal of moves out of a triple threat position. I mean he’s basically a 7’0 Kobe Bryant 

Also, for the pro Derrick rose side, he is one of the flashiest players of all time.  He was essentially Kyrie Irving’s handle, finishing and creativity, mixed with the raw athleticism of a prime Westbrook. He was an incredible watch. One of the best highlight tapes of all time easily. || Embiid is just not likable, he plays dirty, flops a LOT, complains a lot, doesn't take any accountability, doesn't have any playoff success, etc etc 

Rose was the youngest MVP, his play stile was very flashy, had really good playoff games. Just a more likable guy. || The flopping and saying out right he won’t play back to back games. Also throwing some of his teammates under the bus after losing games. Like when the 76ers got eliminated in 23 he said that it was just him and James Harden and the rest of the team wasn’t playing well enough. 
Some scouts also said he was the next Hakeem Olajuwon, which was an unfair bar set for him, so that’s one argument about why some criticism is somewhat unnecessary. || Same reason why people liked the quiet reserved smart kid and not the loud obnoxious smart kid"

I hadn’t had much time to work on it recently, but now I want to discuss something in the NBA that I consider important but is persistently overlooked.

In NBA basketball, creative players who can create their own shots are undoubtedly valuable, and guards generally excel at this. However, especially in recent years, players of the type I will describe below have been overvalued, and many teams fall into this trap.


Here’s my description of the overrated (and I will explain why they are overrated) player type:
A guard, ball-dominant, usually short (6'4"" and under), a poor defender, and a good scorer.


Who are these players?


Russell Westbrook (although his prime is behind him, he was one of the best candidates for this profile at the time), Lillard, Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, James Harden, Cunningham, Bradley Beal, and the like. There are also lower-tier versions, such as Jalen Green, Collin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Malik Monk, D’angelo Russell, etc.

There have been many players of this type in history as well. From better examples like Steve Nash to others such as Starbury (Stephon Marbury), Steve Francis, Monta Ellis, Baron Davis, Gilbert Arenas, John Wall (not that bad defender but still fits the role) and many more…


The point is, no team in the modern era (and this also applies to earlier eras) has won a championship with this type of player as their number-one option. At best, they have made the Finals with very low success rates. Let’s take a look at point guards and players fitting this profile on Finals teams starting from the 1990s.


------------------

(OL means primary player / leader of offense) 


1991 - Chicago Bulls (PG John Paxson and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Los Angeles Lakers (PG Magic Johnson and OL James Worthy)
There was no such player. Paxson was a complementary piece. MJ was an exceptional defender and not small. Magic, on the other hand, was physically imposing and a pass-first player, never a scorer-first.

1992 - Chicago Bulls (PG John Paxson and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Portland Trail Blazers (PG Terry Porter and OL Clyde Drexler)
Same Chicago. For Portland, Terry Porter was a facilitator, and Drexler was the offensive leader.

1993 - Chicago Bulls (PG B.J. Armstrong and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Phoenix Suns (PG Kevin Johnson and OL Charles Barkley)
Same Chicago. KJ was the second option and not a primary scorer.

1994 - Houston Rockets (PG Kenny Smith and OL Hakeem Olajuwon) defeated New York Knicks (PG Derek Harper and OL Patrick Ewing)
Kenny was the third or even fourth offensive option. Derek Harper was similar.

1995 - Houston Rockets (PG Kenny Smith and OL Hakeem Olajuwon) defeated Orlando Magic (PG Anfernee Hardaway and OL Shaquille O’Neal)
Same Houston. Hardaway was both physically large and a pass-first player.

1996 - Chicago Bulls (PG Ron Harper and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Seattle SuperSonics (PG Gary Payton and OL Shawn Kemp)
Even with player changes, same Chicago. Gary Payton was ball-dominant but an excellent defender with no defensive liabilities.

1997 - Chicago Bulls (PG Ron Harper and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Utah Jazz (PG John Stockton and OL Karl Malone)
Same Chicago. Stockton was an exceptional facilitator, the god of pass-first players, and not a poor defender.

1998 - Chicago Bulls (PG Ron Harper and OL Michael Jordan) defeated Utah Jazz (PG John Stockton and OL Karl Malone)
Both teams remained the same.

1999 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Avery Johnson and OL Tim Duncan) defeated New York Knicks (PG Charlie Ward and OL Latrell Sprewell)
Avery Johnson was a good defender, not ball-dominant, and the fourth or fifth offensive option. Charlie Ward was similar.

2000 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Ron Harper and OL Shaquille O’Neal) defeated Indiana Pacers (PG Mark Jackson and OL Reggie Miller)
Ron Harper was perhaps the sixth option on offense, not ball-dominant, physically large, and a solid defender. Mark Jackson was pass-first, an excellent facilitator, and not scorer-first.

2001 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Shaquille O'Neal) defeated Philadelphia 76ers (PG Eric Snow and OL Allen Iverson)
Even with a player change, it was the same Lakers. Allen Iverson is one of the players I mentioned earlier, but he wasn’t as poor defensively as the others and had moved to the shooting guard position this season. They were able to make the Finals because he stopped playing as a point guard.

2002 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Shaquille O'Neal) defeated New Jersey Nets (PG Jason Kidd and OL Jason Kidd)
Same Lakers. Although I selected Kidd as the offensive leader, he was physically large, an excellent defender, and a pass-first player. He does not fit this profile.

2003 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Tim Duncan) defeated New Jersey Nets (PG Jason Kidd and OL Jason Kidd)
Parker fits this profile, but in the Spurs' excellent team system, he was never allowed to be ball-dominant as described, and he wasn’t the primary player. Same Nets.

2004 - Detroit Pistons (PG Chauncey Billups and OL Chauncey Billups) defeated Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Shaquille O'Neal)
Although Billups was the offensive leader, he wasn’t ball-dominant and was an excellent defender. Same Lakers.

2005 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Tim Duncan) defeated Detroit Pistons (PG Chauncey Billups and OL Richard Hamilton)
Same Spurs, same Pistons.

2006 - Miami Heat (PG Jason Williams and OL Dwyane Wade) defeated Dallas Mavericks (PG Jason Terry and OL Dirk Nowitzki)
Jason Williams was the fifth option on offense, while Jason Terry in Dallas was not ball-dominant, as their offense revolved around Nowitzki.

2007 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Tim Duncan) defeated Cleveland Cavaliers (PG Daniel Gibson and OL LeBron James)
Similar Spurs. Parker was more effective now, but the Spurs' system remained the same. Daniel Gibson? :)

2008 - Boston Celtics (PG Rajon Rondo and OL Paul Pierce) defeated Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Kobe Bryant)
Rondo was an excellent facilitator, pass-first, a poor scorer, and a good defender. Similar Lakers—no Shaq anymore, but Kobe is better now. Kobe was ball-dominant but physically large and a great defender.

2009 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Kobe Bryant) defeated Orlando Magic (PG Rafer Alston or Jameer Nelson and OL Dwight Howard)
Same Lakers. The two point guards I mentioned were not primary playmakers. The main playmaker was Hedo Turkoglu, a small forward standing at 6'8"".

2010 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG Derek Fisher and OL Kobe Bryant) defeated Boston Celtics (PG Rajon Rondo and OL Paul Pierce)
Same Lakers. Same Boston.

2011 - Dallas Mavericks (PG Jason Kidd and OL Dirk Nowitzki) defeated Miami Heat (PG Mario Chalmers and OL LeBron James)
As mentioned earlier, Kidd’s role was even more reduced here. Again, LeBron—ball-dominant but physically large and an excellent defender when needed. Chalmers wasn’t even focused on being ball-dominant.

2012 - Miami Heat (PG Mario Chalmers and OL LeBron James) defeated Oklahoma City Thunder (PG Russell Westbrook and OL Kevin Durant)
Same Miami. This was the first time we saw the exact player type I described in the Finals (Westbrook). Even though, he was not primary offensive player but Durant. Harden was also on this team, but he wasn’t ball-dominant with Russ there.

2013 - Miami Heat (PG Mario Chalmers and OL LeBron James) defeated San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Tim Duncan)
Same Miami. Same Spurs.

2014 - San Antonio Spurs (PG Tony Parker and OL Kawhi Leonard) defeated Miami Heat (PG Mario Chalmers and OL LeBron James)
Same for both. Parker was now even more effective, but the Spurs' system remained in place. Kawhi started to emerge as the main figure.

2015 - Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Stephen Curry) defeated Cleveland Cavaliers (PG Matthew Dellavedova and OL LeBron James)
You may have noticed that Curry doesn’t fit this profile. He is one of the rare all-time superstars who can dominate without being ball-dominant. Golden State’s system is already based on ball movement. Once again, another LeBron-led team. (I’ll talk about Kyrie next year.)

2016 - Cleveland Cavaliers (PG Kyrie Irving and OL LeBron James) defeated Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Stephen Curry)
Kyrie is an important detail here. Practically, Kyrie is the only player from this profile to win a championship as part of a title-winning team. However, even though I list Kyrie as the PG, the true playmaker was LeBron. While Kyrie was technically the starting point guard, his role was not playmaking but scoring through individual skills in tight situations. The team was not built around Kyrie. Instead, he was an excellent complementary piece and a great scorer.

2017 - Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Kevin Durant) defeated Cleveland Cavaliers (PG Kyrie Irving and OL LeBron James)
Same teams. Curry takes a step back.

2018 - Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Kevin Durant) defeated Cleveland Cavaliers (PG George Hill and OL LeBron James)
Same teams again.

2019 - Toronto Raptors (PG Kyle Lowry and OL Kawhi Leonard) defeated Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Stephen Curry)
Kyle Lowry was a solid facilitator, not a score-first player, and an excellent defender. Offensively, he was the third or, in some situations, even the fourth option. Same Golden State.

2020 - Los Angeles Lakers (PG LeBron James and OL LeBron James) defeated Miami Heat (PG Goran Dragić and OL Jimmy Butler)
Another LeBron James team versus a poor man’s LeBron James team (Butler). Dragic was the fourth offensive option.

2021 - Milwaukee Bucks (PG Jrue Holiday and OL Giannis Antetokounmpo) defeated Phoenix Suns (PG Chris Paul and OL Devin Booker)
Jrue was the third offensive option, not score-first, and an excellent defender. Chris Paul might seem to fit this profile, but he doesn’t because he is both pass-first and an exceptional facilitator and defender.

2022 - Golden State Warriors (PG Stephen Curry and OL Stephen Curry) defeated Boston Celtics (PG Marcus Smart and OL Jayson Tatum)
Different but still the same Golden State. In Boston, no one fully took on the role of a true playmaker. Smart was essentially a big, defensive player and offensively the third or even fourth option.

2023 - Denver Nuggets (PG Jamal Murray and OL Nikola Jokić) defeated Miami Heat (PG Gabe Vincent and OL Jimmy Butler)
Everyone knows who the real playmaker is in Denver, right? On another team, Jamal Murray might have fit the profile described above. However, his ability to play off-ball alongside Jokic elevated him. Same Miami.

2024 - Boston Celtics (PG Jrue Holiday and OL Jayson Tatum) defeated Dallas Mavericks (PG Luka Dončić and OL Luka Dončić)
Same but improved Boston. Same Jrue. Luka “partially” fits this profile. However, he isn’t that small, which, despite being a poor defender, allows him to hold his own against bigger players.


-----------

As can be seen, no team with a player of the type I described has succeeded in a leading role. There are no exceptions. Only a handful of teams have even reached the Finals with such players. Even if a player of a similar profile exists on a championship team (and even this is rare), they are not in a leading role. They take on secondary, tertiary, or even lower offensive responsibilities. Another exception might be Iverson’s Philadelphia team, but even then, the key detail was Iverson transitioning to the shooting guard position, thereby reducing his ball dominance. I also reiterate that Iverson was not a terrible defender.

At one point, the Harden-led Rockets came very close to succeeding with this model. They could have become champions or at least reached the Finals, and they deserved it. However, they “didn’t.” The Golden State effect played a significant role here, but this type of player tends to wear down over extended series. You may recall Harden’s state during the closing moments of the elimination game against Golden State. Similarly, Luka’s struggles in the later stages of the playoffs have been evident for years. However, with Kyrie added to the team, they managed to reach the Finals (where Kyrie was again the secondary player). Can Luka ever win a championship as the leading player?

In my opinion, this is highly unlikely. While a rematch of last season’s Finals seems possible, I don’t think it will happen again. Even if they somehow manage it, I must reiterate that Luka doesn’t fully fit the profile of the players described above.

To summarize, the NBA has a significant number of players fitting this profile. In fact, finding pass-first American-born guards is almost impossible. Recently, Lonzo showed the ideal portrait of a point guard, but injuries interrupted his career. Garland somewhat fits this description; although he is an average or kinda weak defender, he can still play pass-first. Halliburton is  pretty weak defender but facilitator and undoubtedly a pass-first player. These two could play in the Finals or even win championships alongside elite scorers. De’Aaron Fox is also a candidate here. Over time, he has become less ball-dominant and isn’t a poor defender. Looking at it this way, Jalen Green needs to learn to play like Jamal Murray alongside Alperen Şengün. The more ball-dominant he becomes, the worse it will get, and Houston won't have a chance. On the other hand, SGA (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander) could win a championship with OKC. While he is a good scorer, he is not overly ball-dominant, and in addition to not being small, he is also an excellent defender.

The fascination with ball-dominant, scoring, poor-defending, physically small players in the NBA has led to these players being overvalued. Still, I am not claiming these players are worthless. For instance, Lillard, alongside McCollum, took his team to the Conference Finals. He kept people coming to games in Portland for years and won many games. For that reason, he is valuable.

However, he “isn’t that valuable.” He hasn’t won a championship or even reached the Finals. He never will. Perhaps one day, if he takes on a fourth or fifth role (e.g., Giannis stays in Milwaukee, the Bucks magically (!) find two elite offensie players or Middleton heals, and Lillard transitions to a pass-first role, hitting open shots, and his minutes drop to around 20 per game), he might achieve this.

I think Trae Young could succeed on the right team by tempering his scoring and ball dominance. For instance, in a Spurs team where Vassell has become an elite scorer, and Wemby is competing for the throne, Trae could find a place as an elite facilitator and third offensive option despite his terrible defense. For all the other similar players, the same formula applies. No player of this type has ever played a role on a championship-level team, nor has any of them ultimately succeeded. This is the reality of the NBA. 

In summary, it is very difficult for players of this type to reach the Finals. To achieve this, their roles must inevitably be reduced. Looking at those who have managed to do so, the viable scenarios are as follows:

* Continuing with playmaking but regressing to a second or, ideally, third offensive role (like Westbrook in the OKC Finals).

* Becoming less ball-dominant and transitioning to the shooting guard position (like Iverson or Kyrie).

* Improving their defense to eliminate being a liability, as they cannot physically grow larger (while there’s no example here, being able to at least hold their ground against certain types of players, like Luka, or Harden’s ability to do so in some cases, would suffice).

Versions of this were applied to individual players up until the moment they won, including Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant (as a first option). 

It reminds me of this xkcd comic on electoral precedents: https://xkcd.com/1122/

It's analysis that lacks imagination. I've never seen it happen, ergo it must not be possible. || Your initial assumptions are already flawed because you’ve already clumped together players who struggle on the other side of the floor. I think your conclusion can be, it’s harder to build with this archetype because It has been done before.

You need to back your thesis with empirical data, maybe Usage Rate for guards below 6’4. I would remove the defense part, because it would skew your data to favor the flawed conclusion in your post, and ask a question - what is the impact of one way offensive guards to winning a championship? Plenty of heavy usage guards are instrumental to winning championships, even Steve Nash was an Horry hip check away from winning.  Chris Paul is another good example. 

As for the purpose of this post, teams draft the best available player they can and hope they turn out into a good piece, and most times they turn out to be guards. Naturally, there are more guys below 6’4, and you hope for the best. If you were Detroit, would you pass on Cade (who is 6’6 btw) and say, “Data says, we can’t win around you and draft Jonathan Kuminga instead”. The Kwames, Darkos and Bargiannis of the world have suffered enough. || It *really* feels like you're starting from a conclusion, and trying to create evidence for it.

Firstly, why doesn't Steph Curry fit your definition? Is he too good at defense? Not ball dominant enough? How are you even defining ""offensive leader""? It's just the highest scorer?

You make caveats for Luka and Iverson and Harden, but really it feels like you're just hand waving away instances where your conclusion is wrong, or at least seriously flawed.

I do think it's an interesting topic, definitely worth discussion. Dean Oliver has written about similar concepts and I believe Cody Houdek, Scott Levine, and Evan Zucha have explored almost exactly this in their pod Sense and Scalability, calling it the ""wrong initiator"" problem. || Wow players that are great offensive players and defensive players win more than players that are limited.  This ""analysis"" ignores actual hard evidence too and instead tries to fit evidence into a hypothesis. 

I have no problem with the conclusion itself, but I mean its pretty much common sense by now. Its a piece of wisdom repeated on podcasts. ""you can't win a championship with a small guard as your best player"" Where do you think draft trends have gone in the last couple of years? || * *""...Curry doesn’t fit this profile. He is one of the rare all-time superstars who can dominate without being ball-dominant.""*
* *""As can be seen, no team with a player of the type I described has succeeded in a leading role. There are no exceptions.""*

Steph Curry is not an off-ball player—he’s not Klay Thompson. His usage rate and time of possession are comparable to LeBron’s. In 2016, Steph averaged 5.8 minutes on the ball per game, while LeBron averaged 5.3 minutes. You don’t put up 30 points and 7 assists without dominating the ball. Steph is a ball-dominant guard, short (6'4"" and under), a poor defender, and an elite scorer. He’s an exception.

* *""Kyrie is the only player from this profile to win a championship as part of a title-winning team. However, even though I list Kyrie as the PG, the true playmaker was LeBron. While Kyrie was technically the starting point guard, his role was not playmaking but scoring through individual skills in tight situations.""*

Playmaking was absolutely Kyrie's role. When LeBron sat, Kyrie took over as the primary playmaker, essentially stepping into the LeBron James role—balancing scoring and playmaking. Kyrie averaged 6 assists per game, proving he wasn’t just going 1-on-1 all the time. So this analysis is incorrect; Kyrie is an exception, much like Steph Curry. || The issue with heliocentric teams is that they have players who are that ball dominant because of lack of overall talent on the roster, and it catches up to them when they are up against better teams.

Ie: I am not sure the rockets play style is what caused CP3 to get hurt when they had the warriors on the ropes. || I mean yea. Players who r great at offense and defense tend to be better than players who r just great at offense. Steph curry showed that it’s possible to win w a small guard whose below avg defensively u just need to do great team building around him to make it work defensively. 

It worked with the warriors, many other teams r trying to replicate that. We’ll see if it works again. I think it will || Curry was a ball dominant guard before Kerr coached him. Mj was even more dominant before a strong coach stepped in. These incredible ball dominant players are difficult to coach bc if you just sit back, leu them be great, you still might make to conference finals or further. It takes real discipline to possibly take a step back for the overall goal. Not many franchises are smart and comfortable enough in their own skin to be firm yet not maniacal yelling to get a point across. Bc it’s not on the player to prop up lesser players, that’s the coach and organizations job || I think one of the major flaws in your reasoning is based on the sample we have available. One of the best weapons offensively-minded guards have is the three ball, which has only really become a focus of offences in roughly the past decade. So it’s hard to conclude it cannot work when, for the vast majority of the NBA’s existence, these kinds of guard have essentially been missing one of their best weapons.

Also, as a Bucks fan, your section about Dame confuses me. Whenever Giannis is on court, he’s happy to defer to him. He plays almost like a true PG then, moving the rock wherever it needs to go. He normally only takes the role of primary scorer when Giannis sits and we need a go-to offensive option. 

Holding his playoff record against him when he’s been part of some truly dreadful Blazers teams seems a bit unfair. Saying he needs to drop down to our fourth or fifth option makes absolutely no sense and, as stated, he’s already seemed to accept a pass-first role whenever Giannis is around. And him taking the lead in scoring when Giannis sits makes perfect sense. Who should we have ahead of him? Bobby? GTJ? The only reasonable answer is Middleton, who’s still returning from injury and has, for the time being, settled comfortably into a playmaking role || Love how this guy. Doesn't bring up the Detroit Piston which made it to the NBA Final 3 years in a row 88-90 won 89-90 back to back NBA Championship with Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumar, Dennis Rodman, John Salley, Rick Mahorn, Bill Lambeer and Mark Aguirre. || [removed] || [removed] || Do you mean guard or point guard?  
  
There are tons of people in this list that are ball-dominant shooting guards that won titles as the best player. Jordan, Kobe, Dwyane Wade, Curry, Magic Johnson. Yes, these weren't small players, but they all have very high usage rates, meaning they didn't necessarily bring the ball up the court, but the ball was in their hands a lot. And yes, Curry and Magic were point guards.

Also, the game has changed so that players that used to be shooting guards have been shifted to point guards to put the ball in the hands of the best play-maker more often. Jordan would 100% be a point guard in today's game as would Kobe and Wade.

Harden started as a shooting guard and guys like Cade Cunningham and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander would probably have not been point guards two decades ago. Probably Trae too.  
  
The only thing all these ""ball-dominant guards"" on your list have in common is that they didn't play with other elite superstars. The number of players that have actually led their teams to titles is very small. || >As can be seen, no team with a player of the type I described has succeeded in a leading role. There are no exceptions.

There simply hasn't been a good enough player of that type. You need absolutely transcendent offense to make up for the other shortcomings. 

Part of the story is that we haven't had all that much time with a model. Before Curry became an all-star in 2014, the conventional wisdom was that shooting too many threes wouldn't work in the playoffs. In hindsight, Steve Nash could have hit your profile, but he was curtailing his three point shooting because they didn't know any better.

>Another exception might be Iverson’s Philadelphia team, but even then, the key detail was Iverson transitioning to the shooting guard position, thereby reducing his ball dominance.

2001 Iverson led the league in usage rate. He was as ball dominant a player as they come.

>However, he “isn’t that valuable.” He hasn’t won a championship or even reached the Finals. He never will. Perhaps one day, if he takes on a fourth or fifth role (e.g., Giannis stays in Milwaukee, the Bucks magically (!) find two elite offensie players or Middleton heals, and Lillard transitions to a pass-first role, hitting open shots, and his minutes drop to around 20 per game), he might achieve this.

This doesn't make any sense. If you want a pass-first fourth option on offense, surely you want a better defender than Lillard.

Regarding Lillard's inability to make the finals, I'm less than fully confident prime Jordan takes the 2019 Blazers past the Warriors. || The discussion actually harks back on the principles of the Triangle offense, and the benefits of true team basketball.

Michael Jordan could probably be the greatest point guard of all time, and most likely win 0 championships if he was. There were stints before Phil came to coach the Bulls where Jordan was a dominant overall player, rebounding, passing, defense too. He could average as many assists and rebounds as LeBron if he wanted to. But that necessarily doesn't equate to winning basketball at the highest level, because ultimately basketball is a TEAM game and the best TEAMS win championships. Not the best players, not necessarily the most talented players, not the best ORTGs in the regular season, but the best TEAMS. 

This was what the Triangle did. It shifted the focus from making Jordan, a shooting guard, from leading the offense, from an offense where everyone is dependent on him to create everything, to an offense where people can create for themselves within the system and through their knowledge, IQ, and mastery of the flow of the Triangle. Something like the Triangle, or in other words, a self-sufficient flowing offense, gets more players involved without needing to heavily rely on a guard. And when players are more involved, they play better defense. 

A ball-dominant guard is in many ways the antithesis of team basketball. The guard who must create everything for everyone and will only pass to open players-- if you ever played with that at a basketball court you'd see how bad it really is, how less fun it is, because it's not too far off from isolation-focused basketball. Similar sentiment travels all the way up to the highest level of basketball. 

Not only that but there's and Xs and Os standpoint to it too. A ball-dominant guard operates at the top of the key. You inherently have fewer options to make a pass because there's fewer angles to work with. This is why playmaking forwards, centers, or big guards are generally more dangerous. By getting the ball to playmakers in the post, not only are they in a more deadly area to score, but they have many more angles, actions, and options to make a pass to a shooter or a cutter. They are harder to double as well because you can't hedge on some sort of PnR, you can't trap them above the three point line, and a post pass to them isn't that hard to make. This is what the Triangle, even the Spurs system, and the Warriors system depended on. They depended on Pippen to lead the Triangle, on Shaq and Gasol to playmake at their size, on Tim Duncan, on Draymond Green (who led the Warriors on assists). Big players who can playmake or pass make this system work, and they don't even need to dominate the ball. This is why Jokic, who is just as ball dominant as Luka or Harden, will come out with better success than those 2 come regular season or playoffs where his only inhibitions are actually his defense, not the function of their offense.

History over the last 30+ years has shown, big playmakers, motion offenses will result in better teams that perform at the highest level than teams led by ball-dominant players who operate at the top of the key.

LeBron James actually fits more into ball dominant guard than ball dominant forward, precisely because he prefers to operate from the top of the key as opposed to the post. It's a huge contributor to his inability to fit with a number of different types of players, which also contributes to poor Finals record despite having excellent amounts of talent for a very large majority of his career. || Sounds like a thinly failed anti Luka post when SGA has a higher usage rate. Where’s SGA playoff success if his style is so much better? || I don't know about ball dominance itself but short guards rarely win championships as the leading scorer.

People here might get upset and try to divert the conversation into something else (see: the top comment) but it's logical that the shorter players are going to struggle more against playoff caliber defenses.  The NBA is heavily predicated on height and athleticism.

Additionally, the small guards who are talented tend to be strong scorers and facilitators in the regular season that they they produce wins and make it difficult for the front office to acquire extra help via the draft.

So, between an All-Star PG type vs. an All-Star SF type, I think the latter is easier to build a contender with.  Otherwise, a championship squad is predicated on one MVP contender surrounded by three 17+ppg players (preferably, another All-Star among them....and you can substitute one dominant specialist like Ben Wallace/Draymond Green/Dennis Rodman here).....with 3/5 of the starters playing defense and a solid bench backing them up.  Great majority of championships squads throughout history have featured this.

Not rocket science here.  4/5 offensive outlets (including an MVP tier talent) and 3/5 defensive chokepoints means you bring what needs to be brought to a basketball team. || As constructed, Trae has a better shot of winning a title on the Hawks than on the Spurs. That's a fact. Vassell ain't winning no title as an ""elite scorer"" lol || I wouldn't say the archetype of player you're describing (that in my small NBA group chat are known as ""The Clarksons"") is being *overvalued*, I think scoring \~20 points regularly is still no small task, that's why teams keep paying players that can do that.

The alternative is moneyballing those 20ppg and that means getting a team together that fits perfectly within this strategy, and in basketball is way harder than baseball because you have less players.

So to me, the problem is just that they are not using these players in an effective way. For example, when you said:

>Russell Westbrook (although his prime is behind him, he was one of the best candidates for this profile at the time), Lillard, Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, James Harden, Cunningham, Bradley Beal, and the like. There are also lower-tier versions, such as Jalen Green, Collin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Malik Monk, D’angelo Russell, etc.

the ""lower-tier versions"" are actually the players that are being used correctly. You're not building your team or starting unit around Clarkson, Sexton, Monk, DLo. You're not asking them to guard the 2nd or 3rd best player on the opposing team, you're not asking them to lead. Those are specialists, you need them to score points and go back to sleep. Again, no small feat, and that's why they are employed.

The players that are in your first tier, didn't really have the right team around them. And It's not that the team was spending so much money on them, because they overvalued them and didn't have cap space left to surround them better, the problem to me still is that they are put into roles they don't fit, and because of that any analysis that the team makes to complete the rest of the team is fundamentally flawed. Like, let's go to a couple of examples from your list

Russ: The problem with Russ is that either he's uncoachable, or that he's just not smart, or that he gets easily carried away. I can talk about how he was surrounded, but the difference between him and the rest is that there's  a flaw in his character. The best way to use Russ at times, was to have him take a back seat and just move the ball around, but he'd just pull up, and that killed so many games for all teams he's been on.

Lillard: This is the best example of what I'm trying to explain. Lillard is a god tier scorer, but he's small, he can't AND won't try to defend, and he's not a real floor general. What does Portland do in this situation? For some reason, complete their backcourt with another identical player, but worse in every way, and keep it that way for years. He needed a backcourt partner and a wing that could defend at a high level, and overall players that would be comfortable moving the ball around. Like, ""Dame, you score we do the rest"". You mentioned Iverson moving to the SG spot being the key to that team's success, I disagree, the position is meaningless, the key is surrounding him with talent that fits. The team let him shoot a gazillion times, used a center that could score easy baskets and clean up around the rim, and had a 6th man who could step up and score when he sat down.

Trae: The only time the Hakws had a successful post season, It was a fluke. They haven't surrounded Trae with the type of player he would thrive on. He can lead the offense so he doesn't need another guy that can set the table for him, he does need (like any other player that can pass at a high, high level like him), shooters around him, and defenders so he can hide on D. The only thing the Hawks gave him was Dejounte who fell off a cliff defensively, and now Dyson Daniels who seems to be good for the role. He still needs a bunch of shooters, and a good big to run PnRs and at the moment, their big rotation is chaothic, nobody knows which center is the best, and both are sub-par centers overall.

To wrap it up because this is already too long, you're mentioning some examples of similar players that are good because they thrive off ball. I think this is more of a consequence than a cause. Kyrie, Jamal, Steph, they all have forwards or centers running the point. That's was I was mentioning above, they can't be ball dominant if someone else is setting the table, they have the freedom of movement they need, and if you have the scoring and assisting locked up, you can use the SG spot to get a plus defender.

You can win with any type of player if it's good enough, you just need to build a good team around him. || I definitely subscribe to this theory. There's a compelling mechanistic explanation. Deep in the playoffs, against other elite teams, most of the key differences cut against the player prototype you describe:

Increased physicality makes it harder for smaller, weaker plays to play long minutes. Increased defensive intensity and skill make it harder to maintain your offensive efficiency unless you have the physical size / strength advantage. Defenses scheme to disrupt your flow, particularly sending help, which is a lot easier for taller players (that can easily pass out of a double team / blitz) to deal with, even if you are an elite playmaker.

For players who are weaker defensively, offenses will hunt out mismatches, which also affects your ability to play long, effective minutes game after game.

The best devil's advocate argument I've seen is Steph Curry. Removing him, a lot of the players / teams that have fallen short have really been on the bad side of coin flips. Nash's Suns could have easily done it. Chris Paul & James Harden had some bad luck late in the playoffs. Devin Booker's Suns almost won a finals. || Learned this when the Celtics had IT, Kyrie and then Kemba. It doesn’t work in the playoffs unless you have an anomaly like Steph who is one of the greatest ever. || I actually really enjoy this take. It’s kind of common sense, but at least in the last decade, teams were really trying so hard to find their ball-dominant offensive guard.

I also believe there’s kind of a back-and-forth evolution causing the change. First, guards are encouraged to take 100% of offensive loads after 3-ball and PnR techniques matured. Then, teams countered by drafting mobile wings/ centers, as well as developing advanced defensive schemes. So now the remaining positions and teams have stepped up to the small ball game, and the ball-dominant guard offense became less effective. || Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Steph Curry are all ball dominant guards in their own way.  The players you're citing just aren't nearly as good as they are.  I think ""poor defender"" is doing a lot of work here.

If the best player on your team is Bradley Beal or LaMelo Ball, your team isn't very good.  That's not their fault, that's just poor roster construction.  That doesn't mean they can't be valuable contributors to a championship team. || i think everybody already knew about this. since ball dominant guards are basically the engine of the team and come playoffs everyone would just put a pressure on the engine and everything would fall apart.

what unrealistic for this is for a gm to convince a ball dominant guard to play with a restricted role. first off the salary just wont match unless you are a big market team that could just go over luxury, getting a superstar big/wing is harder when you have a superstar ball dominant guard since your team is guaranteed to not be shit (at least making the playoffs) so you wont get assets for trade and the only way a to get them is through free agency. convincing the guard to get lower salaries is just more unrealistic.

and damn do people really still think westbrook is a poor defender? hes nowhere near all defensive level, but just because of old age and one season of ballwatching defense (where he transitioned from playing with one of the best superstar in the league at the time to being fatigued all game while having to carry a whole team with no offensive weapon to playoffs) people really think hes a career shit defender. hes a decent on ball defender who gambles in passing lane a lot. you cant group him with the others. his case is definitely about shooting not defense, probably one of the most niche cases in nba history : losing his jumpshot overtime || It’s because they’re too small. Look at the history of Finals MVPs. How many point guards do you see on that list? Magic doesn’t count, he’s 6’9. You have IT, Chauncey, and Steph. 
3 guards who had the PERFECT team built for them. 3 outliers out of 80+ years of NBA basketball. 

When it’s the postseason, and the game slows down, there comes times where you NEED your star to get you a bucket. Ask yourselves, what is an easier shot: a 6’7+ guy attacking the rim for a layup, or a 6’1 guard trying to create an off balance jumper from the perimeter? Who in this situation will have an easier time getting themselves a good shot? There’s your answer to this question. || The highest success of this player is Allen iverson making it to the finals. But there is still no valid proof of success with these players. I often say they’re just putting up points. Not winning not necessarily competing but just dribbling and shooting and it goes in. || Ball dominance is good actually.

It's funny because this myth used to just be about small point guards but now we've weaseled in ""ball dominance"" and ""poor defense"". The former allows you to exclude Steph Curry's 4 rings.  The latter I guess lets you exclude a few others including Tony Parker (#1 option for a lot of Spurs teams) as well as a few others, notably some teams that lost the finals.  It's also worth mentioning that ""small"" was also a weasel word added to let the original criteria ignore Magic's 5 rings.  

All of these qualifiers also make the claims less surprising. There's 5 positions on the basketball court, you're taking a fraction of one of them and a tiny fraction of a second one.  Even if success has nothing to do with lead player archtype you're talking about a fairly small percentage of teams and so even over decades you're only going to expect a handful teams to be led by a guy with all these criteria.  

>  the modern era .. 1991 

1991 isn't the start of ""the modern era"" which is generally dated to post-Merger and/or the 3-point line and/or Bird/Magic era when the money took off.  1980 is a typical cutoff. Let's just be honest, **1991 is you cherry picking the endpoint to avoid the Bad Boys Pistons** full stop. There's also no reason to think that the 3 point era or merger made life harder for small ball dominant guards so let's evaluate this claim honestly and go back further: 

Russell's Celts were often led by small guards initially Cousy and Sharman/Ramsey, later KC and Sam Jones. Most were solid/good defenders *for their position*. 

Jojo White (6'3"") was arguably the #1 option for the '76 Celtics, decent defender.

Gus Williams was the #1 option for Seattle '78 and wasn't a good defender.  

Isiah Thomas was the #1 option for the Bad Boys Pistons and wasn't a good defender.

Tony Parker (6'2"") was the #1 options for the '14 Spurs and arguable in '07. He was for sure on the '13 team that was a second away. Overrated defense. 

Steph Curry's defense improved but looks better on paper due to second order offensive effects.  And while he is renowned for off-ball play he has the ball in his hands a lot more than people think. In 2016 he had higher Usage than James Harden. In 2021 he was higher than Trae Young or Dame (who he's right next to for career). || You lost me at Milwaukee trading Holiday to Boston for Lillard... that's not what happened lol. I don't get why people claim Milwaukee GAVE Holiday to Boston || I still support the conclusion of needing a “top X player”

2004 being an exception doesn’t erase the general rule. Look at the best player on title teams over the last 40 years at least, it’s a pretty damn elite group. The 04 Pistons are a wild exception, but an exception nonetheless


Nothing is full proof, but it’s hard to imagine a team having a real chance at the title without that. I agree about hardline rules in most of these cases, but a lot of these were about shifting trends in talent and playstyle in the league."

To become a superstar, he has to fix two problems","Cade Cunningham is having a moment. But how high can he soar with two distinct weights dragging him back down to Earth?

In his fourth season (and first with a dedicated, competent NBA coach in JB Bickerstaff), the 6’6” point guard is putting up All-Star numbers: 23.6 points, 9.3 assists (third in the NBA!), and 7.3 rebounds per game on 45% shooting from the field. He’s also canning 38% of his 6.3 three-balls per game.

Cunningham’s most notable improvement is in his shot. The three-pointer was a major question mark for Cade coming into the year, but he’s shooting a career-high on both accuracy and volume, and it’s become a legitimate weapon. Importantly, the improvement has come across the board and supported a shift in how the shots are generated.

He's improved his catch-and-shoot accuracy from 37.1% last year to 42.0% this year and his pull-up three-pointer from 32.5% to 36.0%. However, his volume of catch-and-shoots has decreased from 3.4 to 2.3 per game, and his volume of pull-ups has doubled from 2.0 to 4.0

This is unusual! We often hear that coaches want star guards to take more catch-and-shoots because, for most players (including Cunningham), that’s the more efficient shot. The gravity of a team’s biggest star moving off-ball can free things up for lesser heavenly bodies, too. But Cunningham is doing far more self-made magic off the dribble than before and converting it at a very respectable rate.

In fact, that’s an overall trend in Motown: the Pistons are quickly resembling the kind of heliocentric offenses that have started to fall out of favor.

Everything flows through Cunningham. He is fourth in the league with[ 94.0 touches per gam](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/touches?dir=D&sort=TOUCHES)e, more than LaMelo Ball, Giannis Antetokounmpo, or Luka Doncic. He’s [sixth in passes per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing?dir=D&sort=PASSES_MADE), and his [34.9% usage rate](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4864#tab-offensive_overview) is fifth behind only Ball, Giannis, Ja Morant, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.

Despite the gaudy assist totals, I’m not sure Cunningham’s passing has improved so much as the team’s offensive personnel has (it must be nice to play with some veterans like Malik Beasley who are capable of making the occasional shot, although the team’s shooting is still lackluster overall). Dishing remains Cunningham’s best attribute. He has especially nice vision finding alleys for oops: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Cunningham is attacking the boards with a renewed vigor this season (personal aside: I love rebounding guards), and his defensive effort has dramatically improved from last season’s career-worst level. Coach Bickerstaff has always gotten the best from his players on that end, and Cunningham is no exception. He’s had some loud blocks, both of the chase-down variety and as the low-man help defender. This one on Antetokounmpo (followed by a sexy long-range bounce pass) deserved a comic-book-style “POW!”: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Bickerstaff hasn’t shied away from siccing Cunningham on talented ballhandlers, either. He’s been the primary defender on Jaylen Brown and Jalen Brunson, for two notable examples. While defensive tracking data is suspect at best, opponents have shot [4.2% worse than expected](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall?CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*cun) with Cunningham as the nearest defender (in the same neighborhood as Dillon Brooks, Draymond Green, and Evan Mobley, although I’m certainly not suggesting he’s on their level as a defender).

At this point, Cunningham is a bit too slow and inconsistent to be more than an average defender, but average is fine! He’s rarely the weak point offenses will attack — [teams have only targeted him 13 times in isolation](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/players/615e4bcfe771e94fc0e9eab4/playtypes?seasonId=66ec94cbd172189f95bf08b2&competitionId=non-exhibition-54457dce300969b132fcfb34&compsCategory=1&offense=false), far less on a per-game basis than last year. They prefer to go after juicier targets like Tim Hardaway Jr. or Tobias Harris (although Harris, in particular, has held up well in those situations). It is worth noting that Bickerstaff’s players have historically shown steady defensive growth across multiple seasons. Cunningham’s size and intelligence mean he could end up being a plus on that end.

Add it all up, and he’s carrying a two-ton made-in-Detroit SUV on his shoulders. It’s a heavy load for a fourth-year player, particularly one still with fewer than two full seasons of games under his belt. To Cunningham’s immense credit, he’s grown with his burden. His advanced metrics are at career-best levels, including an [EPM ](https://dunksandthrees.com/player/1630595)just outside the top decile of the league. [Andy Bailey’s Huge Nerd Index](https://x.com/AndrewDBailey/status/1866908831525290265), which averages seven prominent catch-all metrics, rates him as the 30th-best player in the league. Having turned 23 the day before Halloween, Cunningham is younger than every single player above him except two (albeit by a few weeks in some cases).

This is all fantastic news for the Detroit Pistons. They have a young, growing star on their hands. But to become a *superduperstar*, Cunningham has two last warts to freeze off. Both require a little context.

Everyone’s heard about Cunningham’s turnover problems at this point. He leads the league with 4.6 per game, a smidge higher than Young or Ball. Part of that is due to the sheer amount of playmaking that falls on the youngster. His actual [turnover rate of 15.6% ](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4864#tab-offensive_overview)is only 33rd percentile for point guards; in other words, below-average but far from league-worst.

My eyeballs see two major causes. First, he has to tighten up his handle. Cunningham’s ballhandling skill is high, but he can get careless with the rock. A low point was a recent game against the Pacers (an easy Detroit win, to be fair), when Jarace Walker snatched Cade’s cookies four separate times. He starts his crossover high and pushes through it slowly, giving good defenders time to jam him up: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Cunningham also routinely makes passes my toddler would call “silly” (and I’d call something else). At times, he predetermines his reads and can’t or won’t audible. His [8.3% turnover rate on drives](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives?CF=GP*GE*10&dir=D&sort=DRIVES) is the highest of anyone in the top 20 for drives per game (min. 10 games played), and inexplicable passes like this are part of the reason why: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Other times, he gets caught indecisively in the air, lofting balloons for opponents to snag by the string and merrily sprint away with: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Cunningham should outgrow some of these mistakes, but like any high-usage ballhandler, some will always remain. Turnovers, in and of themselves, aren’t always a bad thing, but I’d like to see more turnovers of aggression rather than meekness. He needs to excise the worst offenses to maximize his playmaking abilities. I am optimistic he will do so, particularly as the Pistons’ surrounding cast improves.

Cade’s second flaw is a little more nuanced. He’s struggled to finish at the hoop his entire career, and it hasn’t improved much over time. A third of his shots have come at the rack this season, a substantial number, but Cunningham [has never finished a season above 58% at the rim](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4864#tab-shooting_accuracy), an atrocious rate for a player his size.

A deeper statistical analysis reveals something interesting. Bball-Index’s proprietary formulas say Cunningham has elite finishing talent but is taking some of the hardest shots in the league when considering shot location and defensive presence (he is in the first percentile for “Rim Shot Quality”).

That’s a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it means Cade can generate and finish the difficult shots that all offenses require to a degree; on the other, it means he pretty much *only* takes difficult shots. Cade is a below-average athlete for someone who drives as much as he does, relying on craft and guile to worm into the paint. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen Cunningham redline his engine. The ability to play at his own pace is a skill, but he also never gets the blow-by layups that quicker counterparts can feast on.

He doesn’t have enough first-step quickness to explode past guys or vertical pop to elevate in traffic for big finishes (Cunningham has tallied just four dunks in 22 games this season). He is at his best when he remembers to use his size to bump a defender off their lane and extend over them for a layup. He loves to use a spin (full or half) to get a moment’s separation: [\[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/cade-cunningham-is-a-star-to-become)\]

Taller, slower point guards rarely excel in the paint; LaMelo and Lonzo Ball have famously struggled with the same issue. Cunningham isn’t likely to turn into the Roadrunner anytime soon, but there are ways for him to improve.

Can he get even stronger and bully smaller defenders? Cade doesn’t have a bulldog frame, but there is potential for him to fill out more. Can his three-point accuracy improve to the point that defenders have to stick tighter to him, allowing him to create bigger advantages with hesitations and shot fakes? Can he develop Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s airtight shake-and-bake handle? He’s been on-ball more than ever this year, but is there some latent cutting and off-ball savvy in his game? Cunningham’s also still working on his off-hand; he’s become *far* better driving left, but there’s still room for improvement.

A related note: finding a way to draw more free throws would help Cunningham’s efficiency immensely. Some fans believe he gets a bad whistle, but the truth is that he hasn’t been able to create off-the-dribble advantages that lead to compromised defenders. They have no reason to foul when they can bother the shot with a good contest.

Taking a step back, the fact that Cunningham can get to the rim as much as he does is promising; adding just a little more efficiency here would do wonders for his overall game. He’ll have to hit on at least one of the ideas above to do so.

The difference between stars and superstars is their ability to create high-level, efficient offense for themselves and their teammates. Cunningham has continually progressed in this area, and lineups with the point guard [have scored at league-median rates](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4864/lineups#tab-four_factors) despite below-average surrounding talent. But there isn’t a superstar in the league with as poor finishing numbers as Cunningham (at least, who doesn’t also draw free throws), and he simply must find a way to improve his rim scoring to reach his potential.

Cunningham has developed (and brought Detroit along with him) despite one of the worst basketball ecosystems in the league. For the first time since Cunningham was still in high school, the Pistons are respectably bad instead of a laughingstock (their *best* record in the last five years was 23-59; they’re on pace for 32 this season). Questions about Cunningham’s ceiling on a contender are beside the point; Cunningham is far from a finished product, and the Pistons have a lot of talent acquisition to go before they can start worrying about competing for home-court advantage in the playoffs. Cunningham has time and a clear roadmap for improvement. There are multiple routes he can travel to get to his destination, although he’s far from certain to get there. I’m excited to see which direction he takes.",310,48,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hetyi2/cade_cunningham_is_a_star_to_become_a_superstar/,2024-12-15 09:43:39," I want the kid to succeed. Detroit has been no-man’s land for almost twenty years in the NBA. Hope he can continue to get better. His scoring needs to improve overall if he’s going to make it to elite levels. At that level of usage he needs to be scoring more. Some talent around him would help that but he’s just not that dynamic of a scorer compared to other elite guards. At his size he should be able to score more effectively. || Great read! It's been a while since we've had this much excitement in Detroit basketball.

Giannis Antetokounmpo,"""Giannis Antetokounmpo"" OR ""Giannis"" OR ""Greek Freak"" OR ""The Greek Freak"" OR ""Antetokounmpo"" OR ""The Freak""",2025-01-04,nbadiscussion,1htf1ow,The Heat are already Tyler Herro's team,"Tyler Herro was so close to taking the easy way out.

A scuffle erupted at the end of Miami’s surprising Jimmy Butler-less win over the Houston Rockets in late December. Amen Thompson was locked up with Tyler Herro and suddenly threw him to the floor. Chaos ensued, with six ejections following the resulting brouhaha.

Herro was asked after the game if anything had led to that moment or if it was just the inevitable outcome of a physical game. “Just a physical game,” Herro said. Then he [paused for a loooong time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRAyboCmK-Y), smirked, and continued, “Guess that’s what happens when someone’s scoring, throwing dimes, doing the whole thing. I’d get mad, too.”

He was right to talk his s\*\*\*. The Rockets are far from the only ones to get lit up like a victory cigar by Herro this season.

*\[Thanks for reading! As always, I've included a bunch of illustrative video GIFs. You can* [view them all in-context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-heat-are-already-tyler-herros) *or at the links throughout the article.\]*

On the year, Herro is averaging 24.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.1 assists on pristine 47.8% shooting from the field and 41.0% bombing from deep. Every single one of those numbers is a career-high (Herro is a leading candidate for Most Improved Player for a reason).

The most blinding number is the outside shooting. Herro is putting up 9.6 triples per game, fifth-most in the entire NBA for qualifying players. Of the four players ahead of him, only Steph Curry (41.8%) swishes more often. Not bad company to be in.

Herro is equally dangerous on the catch ([43.1%](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629639/shots-dash)) and off the bounce ([39.0%](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629639/shots-dash)), launching about equal numbers of each. He needs zero room to get them off, too. This was taken with 18 seconds left on the shot clock! \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-heat-are-already-tyler-herros)\]

At 6’5”, Herro has always been able to shoot over smaller guardsmen. Longer, physical defenders used to give him trouble when he was on the ball, but he’s had little problem shedding them this year. Herro has paired an improved handle with quicker decision-making to punish minuscule miscues, and once he has the advantage, he doesn’t give it back. It can be cruel. He’ll play with his food: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-heat-are-already-tyler-herros)\]

Herro has become an excellent off-ball mover, particularly compared to earlier in his career, when he tended to float aimlessly while waiting for the ball. He is particularly adept in the handoff game, where he ranks[ in the 96th percentile](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/players/5d9d3cc97455336e87fb9d4a/playtypes?seasonId=66ec94cbd172189f95bf08b2&competitionId=560100ac8dc7a24394b955ee) as a scorer. Herro will rocket around with the precise arcs and severe angles of an architect until he finds a sliver of South Beach sunlight: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-heat-are-already-tyler-herros)\]

Fun fact: Herro is shooting [46% on three-pointers taken after one dribble.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629639/shots-dash)

He’s hunting triples the way he used to hunt pull-up fifteen-footers. More than half of his shots are from deep, and just [5% are long midranges](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4584#tab-shooting_frequency) — down from 15% last season.

In December, [Herro explained his mindset to Couper Moorhead.](https://www.nba.com/heat/news/coup-rebel-with-cause-tyler-herro) “I feel like with my body type and the way I play, it’s like Steph Curry. I try to make my shot profile as identical to Steph as possible. Steph shoots a lot of threes obviously, the rest of them are to the rim, layups and free throws. That’s kind of what I’m trying to resemble is literally what Steph’s doing.”

Curry, of course, is a different animal altogether, but the inspiration is clear. He's even shooting from way behind the line now. It’s nice to have a 35-foot escape hatch: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-heat-are-already-tyler-herros)\]

Defenses have always respected Herro’s outside shot. The gameplan used to be to force him inside the arc, where they could easily goad him into pull-up middies. But there, too, Herro has dramatically improved. 20% of his shots are at the rim, his highest share in three years and his most on an absolute level ever.

Herro doesn’t have an explosive first step, but he’s become adept at using the threat of his three-pointer to get defenders out of their defensive stance. His dribbling is noticeably tighter. It gets to the point. A Hemingway novel, not Tolstoy. Every move is calculated: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-heat-are-already-tyler-herros)\]

Herro is [stronger this year than ever,](https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nba/miami-heat/article288326625.html) which has made him far more comfortable finishing in a crowd: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-heat-are-already-tyler-herros)\]

That strength also translates to whistles. Nobody will mistake Herro for Giannis Antetokounmpo anytime soon, but he’s [above the positional median](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4584#tab-foul_drawing) in drawing fouls for the first time in his career. Herro is more willing and able to weaponize his shoulders.

With gains all over the floor, Herro has become one of the league’s most efficient shooters. Herro’s true shooting percentage of [62.7% is in the league’s top decile](https://www.nbarapm.com/player/Tyler%20Herro) (and miles above his next-highest mark of 56.6%). Players almost never increase their volume and their accuracy to this degree simultaneously, particularly this late into their careers.

Since we’re still on the subject of career highs, we’d be remiss not to discuss playmaking. Even as Herro seeks his shot, he’s averaging his most [potential assists per 100 possessions ](https://www.nbarapm.com/player/Tyler%20Herro)while simultaneously notching his lowest bad-pass percentage. The decision-making is crisper. Herro is picking apart double teams both often and more precisely than ever before: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-heat-are-already-tyler-herros)\]

His passing has even opened up his scoring, like here, where he petrifies Dillon Brooks with the oopsy-doodle: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-heat-are-already-tyler-herros)\]

Unfortunately, teams have been picking Herro apart, too. The best you can say about the former Kentucky Wildcat on defense is that he generally tries hard (a must on an Erik Spoelstra team) and never fouls. The worst you can say is that he has quicksand feet, alligator arms (a 6’3” wingspan? In this economy?), and a propensity for ramming into a screen like a crash test dummy: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-heat-are-already-tyler-herros)\]

Advanced stats rate him somewhere between comfortably [below-average](https://www.bball-index.com/leaderboards-tool/) to [execrable ](https://dunksandthrees.com/player/1629639/historical)on the defensive end (and very, very good offensively). Personally, I lean toward the former. [Lineups with Herro on the floor have been at the median defensively](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4584/lineups#tab-four_factors) (even with fellow dartboard Duncan Robinson playing next to him), and the Heat have grown adept at mitigating his weakness with funky zones, pre-switching, and general Bam Adebayoness. At least in the regular season, Spoelstra can effectively hide Herro, avoiding too much damage.

One related area where Herro does his own damage is defensive rebounding, where he is excellent for his position. A silver lining of the Heat working to keep Herro out of the action is that it allows him to stalk rebounds once the ball is in the air. Directly grabbing the ball allows Herro to sprint immediately into semi-transition, where Herro can cook scrambling defenses with a pull-up three or a drive to the basket.

Herro’s offense far outweighs his defensive weakness, and he is playing at an All-Star level. For a guy who has been in the league seemingly forever, he is also younger than some people realize; he’s turning 25 in two weeks. That said, he doesn’t have the blistering athleticism to become a true superstar scorer. Everything with Herro is craft and skill, and he’ll hit the limits of that at some point.

Herro won’t ever be the best player on a championship squad, and that’s okay! There are maybe 10-ish players in the NBA who can drive the bus, and that’s with [Carvana-level accounting](https://nypost.com/2025/01/02/business/carvana-shares-tumble-after-short-seller-claims-accounting-grift-for-the-ages/).

So where does that leave the Heat? Whatever happens with Jimmy Butler, it’s pretty clear he’s on his way out of town sooner or later. It was already Herro’s offense. Now, it’s Herro’s team.

The Heat with [Herro on the court and Butler off](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4584/lineups?off=526#tab-four_factors) are essentially breakeven, and the team is 5-5 without Butler playing at all this season. That’s not bad, but “not bad” isn’t what Pat Riley aims for.

Miami is at a crossroads. Too much hinges upon what return Pat Riley gets for Butler to make even an educated guess as to what they look like next season. They’ve rarely been a team willing to take steps back, but it’s hard to figure out how they can take one forward.

Then again, none of that is Herro’s problem. Miami has gotten out of plenty of sticky situations before.

It's a deep dive into where New York currently stands as a team and what options it has to break out of its current rut.*

**I hope you enjoy it!**

The New York Knicks always [come packaged with guarded optimism](https://neilpaine.substack.com/p/its-ok-to-be-excited-about-the-knicks?utm_source=publication-search). The franchise hasn’t won an NBA title in more than a half-century, [finding ways](https://neilpaine.substack.com/p/nobody-has-the-knicks-number-like?utm_source=publication-search) to [mess it all up](https://www.si.com/nba/2022/01/13/john-starks-pat-riley-1994-nba-finals-game-7-daily-cover) whenever they get especially close, but there’s also a palpable sense of excitement in New York City whenever the Knicks are on the upswing.

However, as promising as this season seems, the factors fueling New York’s success could also be what makes the team vulnerable during playoff time.

**Is Too Much Continuity Bad?**

Let’s explain that a bit more. We mentioned that the Knicks have [one of the most effective starting lineups](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?StarterBench=Starters&dir=A&sort=NET_RATING) in the league, with a net rating that trails only those of the Thunder, Cavaliers, and Celtics. (Good company to be in!) However, New York relies on its starters more than other teams. According to [data from PBPStats.com](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/team?Season=2024-25,2023-24,2022-23,2021-22,2020-21,2019-20,2018-19,2017-18,2016-17,2015-16,2014-15,2013-14,2012-13,2011-12,2010-11,2009-10,2008-09,2007-08,2006-07,2005-06,2004-05,2003-04,2002-03,2001-02,2000-01&SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&StartType=All&GroupBy=Season&StarterState=5v5,5v4,5v3,5v2,5v1,5v0), coach Tom Thibodeau is using his starters — a group that [almost always includes](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2025_start.html) OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Towns — for 18.9 minutes per night. Not only does that lead all teams this season (Denver is second at 18.0), but it’s tracking to make New York the 22nd-most heavily reliant NBA team on starters since 2000-01: 

Even putting aside [Thibs’ long-running tendency](https://www.nba.com/news/minnesota-timberwovles-tom-thibodeau-not-fretting-over-starters-minutes-load) to max out minutes for his veteran starters, it makes sense for these Knicks to be so focused on keeping their best players on the court. New York’s core group of starters from above also happens to be synonymous with its Top 5 players by [Estimated RAPTOR Wins Above Replacement](https://neilpaine.substack.com/i/150270605/nba-estimated-raptor-leaderboard) this year, generating a combined total of 19.6 WAR — the most of any team’s Top 5 in the entire league, so far. (Boston is No. 2 with 19.1 WAR from its Top 5 players.) The Knicks’ core is playing a lot, and it’s paying a lot of dividends in the standings.

Furthermore, this Knicks starting lineup has a lot of depth to it in terms of contributions. While Brunson and KAT [are far and away the team leaders](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2025.html#advanced::18) in Usage Rate — carrying nearly 60 percent of team possessions together while on the court — the overall value provided by the Knicks’ Top 5 is quite balanced in a historical sense. Here’s a plot of every pre-2025 team since 2000-01 (plus the ‘25 Knicks) whose 5 best players produced at a pace of at least 40.0 WAR per 82 games, along with the WAR per 82 of their No. 1 player: 

With the lowest team-leading figure of any team in the sample, this year’s Knicks are tracking for the most spread-out value from Nos. 1-5 on their roster of any team with a dominant five-player core since 2000-01. It’s a testament to how suited each player is to their role, plus how well they’ve been able to execute them early this season.

And the power of a strong Top 5 for a title contender is undeniable. [One of the biggest differences](https://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/post/nba_postseason_change) between regular season and playoff basketball is that rotations shorten in the postseason, [downplaying the value of a deep bench](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1492103-debating-nba-depth-vs-star-power-for-playoff-success) and emphasizing the importance of a team’s star players. (How many times have we seen a team that accrues regular-season wins on superior depth — but little star power — [flame out in the postseason](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-raptors-bench-is-destroying-the-nba/)?) In that sense, the Knicks are playing playoff-style basketball earlier than anybody else, and proving that they can win with it.

But there are downsides to taking such an approach, too.

As part of their tendency to [roll with the same 5-man unit far more than any other team](https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/traditional?PerMode=Totals&dir=D&slug=traditional&sort=MIN) in the league, the Knicks have been spamming the NBA with one action above anything else: The Brunson and Towns Pick-and-Roll (PnR).

It’s a play they’re built for. New York is a slow-paced team who loves to grind things out in the halfcourt — they [rank 26th](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2025.html#advanced-team::13) in possessions per 48 minutes (96.9) and [second-slowest](https://www.pbpstats.com/totals/nba/team?Season=2024-25&SeasonType=Regular+Season&StartType=All&Type=Team&StatType=Totals&Table=Misc) in average seconds per possession (15.4). Brunson and KAT are the team’s best offensive players by far, and they’re two of the league’s foremost experts in the art of the PnR. So it should be no surprise that, according to Second Spectrum, the duo has run 545 PnR actions this season, the most of any combination in the NBA. They are running a whopping 31.9 PnRs per 100 possessions.

How effective has it been? The duo is producing at a clip of 1.081 points per direct action, which ranks eighth among the top 20 most-used PnR combos this year and in the 62th percentile of the NBA overall. The 62th percentile is nothing to scoff at; it’s a solid night out with the boys having [Maine Lunch IPA](https://mainebeercompany.com/beer/lunch)s and wings; it’s not a night you’ll never forget, but it’s quality.

However, dig deeper, and those sweet Maine Lunch IPAs start to look slightly more like PBRs. For one thing, the Brunson and Towns PnR has seen its points per direct action decrease in every month of the season:

With the benefit of more film and data, opposing teams have learned to run coverage schemes that force Towns into a spot where he is asked to be a playmaker rather than a play finisher, where he is best. 

Two solutions have emerged to slow down the Brunson/Towns PnR:

1. **Primary Matchups:**

At the beginning of the year, teams were guarding Towns with their five-man. This matchup put the two defenders guarding the PnR action in hell: Do you switch and leave your five on an island with Brunson? No thanks. Play drop coverage and hope you can get a late contest on a Towns pick-and-pop 3-pointer after stopping the ball? Pass.

Now, teams are putting their five-man on someone other than Towns and using a more switchable defender instead, someone they wouldn't mind switching onto Brunson. The move allows for a simple switch each time the screening action happens.

After these switches, Towns and New York aren’t hunting the subsequent matchups as post-ups for him, even though he’s been pretty efficient this season in the post, scoring at 1.208 points per direct action. Indeed, he’s only attempting about five post-ups per 100 possessions.

**2. Early Rotations from First Tag Man:**

Another change has been early rotations from the backside to Towns when teams blitz the ball out of Brunson’s hands.

This coverage turns Towns into a playmaker — not his forte — rather than a finisher. Towns averages about 0.77 dribbles per touch (40th percentile), even while scoring 1.210 points per direct touch (94th). He’s a natural-born scorer, but teams are forcing him to become a passer.

The predictability of the Knicks’ scheme has allowed teams to funnel the basketball to lower-yield actions such as Towns’ playmaking opportunities or Bridges/Hart threes, none of which are considered strengths for this offense.

# Can Anyone Help Brunson Initiate?

The problem is, there aren’t other options to initiate offense that allow the NYK to play from an advantage with their starting 5 (which, again, has played *seven times* as much [as any other lineup](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2025/lineups/#all_lineups_5-man_)) aside from Brunson. 

Getting the offense playing from an advantage is all about cracking the defensive shell, aka getting them in rotation. The best players in the world at this have a combination of two strengths that they use in tandem to create fear:

* **Shooting + Ballhandling:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving, Trae Young and James Harden.
* **Strength + Ballhandling:** Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Isaiah Hartenstein, and Domantas Sabonis.
* **Speed + Ballhandling:** Ja Morant and De’Aaron Fox.

The NYK have one player in the starting five that can fit this description: Brunson, and that’s it. This makes it incredibly difficult to take the load off of JB. Just look at how few of the other Knicks’ starters can even *attempt* off-the-dribble 3-pointers — a critical ability for initiators, whose job is to instill fear in defenses, forcing them to bring two players to the ball and get other defenders in rotation — much less turn them into efficient plays: 

The predictability of the Knicks’ scheme has allowed teams to funnel the basketball to lower-yield actions such as Towns’ playmaking opportunities or Bridges/Hart threes, none of which are considered strengths for this offense.

Thus, the Knicks have a [$200 million roster](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cash/_/year/2024/sort/cash_total) with no depth that plays its starters more than anyone else but only has one consistently dangerous initiator within that group. (Every other contender has two such players.)

So what should the Knicks do with their problem of overreliance on certain plays and players? Spread the wealth — but maybe not in the way you think.

The idea of letting someone on the New York roster other than Brunson initiate the offense seems silly, so suggesting anyone else as an offensive hub is like throwing sand through a screen door. 

*(Whispers… wouldn’t it be nice if they still had a* [*7-foot playmaking hub*](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harteis01.html) *for who could quickly transition the ball from one side to the other and run efficient dribble handoff, split, or PnR actions?)*

Anyway, Brunson currently leads the league in a plethora of categories related to “touches”: 

If you don’t get the point, it’s Brunson’s show; he’s the center of the wheel, and everyone else is just a spoke.

One idea to diversify New York’s offense might be for Bridges to run more PnR as the ballhandler. He’s currently running 6.9 PnR’s per 100 (40th percentile) and scores 1.008 points per direct action (68th percentile). 

Those numbers are acceptable, albeit on low volume. But these plays are rare enough that they probably don’t make it to the top of the scouting report. Teams play whatever their base coverages are for PnR defense. If the volume ticked up and this action became a more central focus on the scouting report, you would see a lot of “under” actions, daring Bridges to shoot behind the screen.

While Bridges has had a much higher Usage Rate at times than his current 19.4 percent mark — [he was, remarkably, a 30 percent Usage guy](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-mikal-bridges-went-from-supporting-player-to-star/) after being shipped to the Nets in 2022-23 — he didn’t exactly shine when he ran a higher volume as a PnR ballhandler. Over the past two seasons in Brooklyn, Bridges executed 1,950 PnR actions, ranking 59th in efficiency out of the top 79 PnR ballhandlers by volume during that period.

These aren’t exactly impressive numbers. As a primary ballhandler in the PnR, Bridges isn’t efficient; he’s limited as a playmaker and doesn’t score at a high or efficient enough clip.

# Does New York Have A Counter Punch?

However, switching up the PnR combination might still be on the right track. The key is to insert new screeners as two-man partners for Brunson, not take the ball out of JB’s hands. 

Hart and Bridges are naturally more creative and comfortable being playmakers in an advantageous situation than Towns. At the same time, Towns creates more gravity off the ball as a shooter than either Hart or Bridges. As a result, both the Brunson/Hart (No. 7 at 1.240 points/direct action) and Brunson/Bridges (No. 3 at 1.254) pick-and-roll combos rank among the league’s Top 10 most efficient PnR pairings this season, with a minimum of 100 total PnR plays.

Unlike Towns, Hart and Bridges are both natural-born playmakers. And once they set the screen, they are both creative cutters who see the open space within the defense and consistently exploit it to create a shot for themselves or a teammate.

The potency of these combinations lies in the matchups: Opposing teams have been using their five-man as the primary defender on Hart, not Towns, while the worst perimeter defender usually defends Bridges. Deploying Hart and/or Bridges as the screener takes away the opposing team’s option to switch the action: Leaving either a five-man or your worst perimeter defender on an island with JB is, as the kids would say, [BBQ Chicken](https://www.tiktok.com/@espn/video/7338931241259093294?lang=en).

This means extra communication is needed on defense, and any time players need to communicate, it opens the opportunity for panicked thinking. These slight miscommunications can put the defense a half-step behind — and in the NBA, a half-step behind versus a smart veteran team like New York will almost always result in a quality shot.

These aren’t exactly impressive numbers. As a primary ballhandler in the PnR, Bridges isn’t efficient; he’s limited as a playmaker and doesn’t score at a high or efficient enough clip.

Another side benefit would be to make the Knicks less dependent on just two players to handle the majority of the scoring and playmaking load. Because right now, the Brunson/KAT workload is historic: New York is tracking to be just the ninth team since 1977-78 with two players boasting a Usage Rate over 27 percent and no one else on the roster at 20 percent. 

This, in turn, might make the Knicks a more unpredictable team that is harder to scheme up in a seven-game playoff series — and can more readily beat good opponents. Currently, the Knicks rank third-to-last in the quality of their victories in terms of the average [Elo rating](https://neilpaine.substack.com/p/2024-25-nba-forecast?open=false#%C2%A7nba-elo-ratings-and-form-report) of the teams they’ve beaten; only the Sixers (1428) and Wizards (1437) have won against teams with a lower quality than the Knicks’ 1438 mark.

# Contender or Pretender?

All of this might sound like we’re down on the Knicks, or being unnecessarily harsh on a team that [has a legitimate chance](https://neilpaine.substack.com/i/150270605/nba-forecast) to win the title. But in many ways, New York’s problems would be the envy of other teams. They have a core with two high-scoring stars and a supporting cast of starters that can fit into multiple roles. Perhaps recognizing this, Thibodeau and the Knicks have leaned heavily on what came most naturally for that group right away. 

But winning in the NBA is about more than talent or even money plays; it’s also about who can adapt and then counter-adapt from there. The rest of the league is beginning to figure out what New York does best, and the regular season isn’t even halfway over yet. It’s what the Knicks do from here that will determine whether they have the adaptability to finally cash in on their championship potential — or if this will be just another season of promise that goes unfulfilled in the Big Apple.",449,54,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1hyc7jr/the_knicks_are_riding_brunson_and_towns_but_are/,2025-01-10 14:10:14,"It's terrifying for Knicks fans, but I really think the season hinges largely on the health of Miles McBride and Mitchell Robinson just to alleviate the minutes load on Brunson and Towns. There is not an easy solution on the team with the over-reliance on Brunson and Towns. 

Certainly, changing up the PnR partners would help, but Brunson and Towns are still on the floor. They have no choice but to live with that two man game. Other champions have ridden two stars to titles. 

When it comes to contenders, you're always searching for a tiny margin to improve. A tiny silver lining to this season is that both Bridges and OG are capable of shooting better from 3 than they have so far this season. All things equal, if both were shooting their career average, Knicks would bump up 7th to 5th in ppg and 17th to 14th in 3PM. 

Where the Knicks have to improve to catch up to the Thunder, Cavs, and Celtics is on the defensive end specifically the turnover differential. The Knicks are the 7th worst team in the league in forcing turnovers. They're just not generating enough points off turnovers which would alleviate some of the usage off Towns and Brunson. Deuce is their best defender navigating over screens, and he's been injured. 

But I also believe the defensive cohesion between Bridges, OG, and Hart will come. All three of them have had far better defensive rating seasons in their career. It's hard to catch up to the lineup stability other contenders have had when Bridges and Towns are new to the team, and OG missed large portions of last season.

The minutes load remains the biggest problem. All five starters are playing over 34.6 mpg. SGA is averaging 34.7. On the Celtics, only Tatum and Brown are playing that many minutes. No one on the Cavs are playing more than 31.4. Closing out teams, getting easy wins, getting easy buckets... is the only path forward for the Knicks to catch up to the other contenders. || A substantial amount of charts, graphs, and film edits go into the deep dive.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it! || A lot of their issues lately have come from a general team cool-off from behind the arc. For a team that’s built around getting players like Bridges & OG open for spot up 3s, they have not been falling the same way they were early in the season. When they’re playing a bad team, the offense is still potent enough to win despite this, because they still have a very strong presence inside the arc as well (They won a game hitting only 3 3s a couple weeks ago). However vs good teams that they can’t simply overpower offensively, they need their 3 point shooters to be hitting.

I’m not sure if it’s due to the heavy minutes played, other team figuring them out, or just a random coldness from multiple players at once, but something is definitely off offensively right now. Historically, Thibs has made the right team decisions when it comes to figuring out how to get the best out of his guys, but he always takes his time making those decisions; nothing reactionary. I trust that he will figure out what’s best for the team by playoff time, but there will be lots of bumps on the way. || Brunson-Towns Spanish P&R with either OG or Mikal (depending on who brings the worse defender into the action) could also be worth looking at || Bridges is capable of being a second on ball option and definitely needs more on ball reps. Towns isnt a “facilitator” but the dude can pass and has pretty good vision. They definitely should be giving him more post ups as well. As for the league figuring out the Brunson/Towns PnR, really not a concern. At the end of the day you put two of the best offensive players in the league in an action together and they have to make plays. Thats how any NBA team works especially in the playoffs. || [removed] || As usual with Thibs, his teams will get more regular seasons wins than another coach with same team. And then in playoffs when rest of teams play starters more minutes one sees that that weren’t as good as their record. || Bridges is gonna want to be paid and that is gonna add to the Knicks salary cap woes but their bigger issue is that they have so few picks through 2031 because of the Six-Pick-Mik trade they’ll not be able to have the young talent on rookie cost controlled contracts that big spending teams need.

I can understand wanting to trade for a popular player who is friends with others on the team but that is a “vibes” trade. You don’t give up that amount of draft equity for a player that has never been an All-Star. At least Rudy Gobert is a defensive monster in the regular season.

KAT is gonna be a $60m per season player soon and he’s already had some injuries.

Until I see Mitchell Robinson return and play with this squad a little, I don't want to pin down their key issues just yet, there should be much more offensive and defensive options open up with him back.

That said, I do also wish to see Mikal and Mcbride get more ball handling duties even when Brunson is sharing the floor with him to create more options on offense || [removed] || The key with other teams riding two stars is that BOTH stars can be the center of the offense that initiates advantage opportunities for others; towns, for all his talent, can not do this side of the coin.

Towns average 0.7 dribbles per touch; this is a clear sign of a play finisher, not a guy you run the offense through.

\^\^ Which is okay! He's fantastic at what he does!

The problem is they blew the big trade package on a guy who also can't do this.. that's the bigger problem. If you deal five first-round picks, you've got to get something better than a role-player. || Good post for an outsider to read. Thank you! || As usual with Thibs, his teams will get more regular seasons wins than another coach with same team. And then in playoffs when rest of teams play starter more minutes one sees that that weren’t as good as their record. || OG is a good shooter. For him, open shots are a good thing and something that teams do not want to give up.

Bridges is not a good shooter; open shots for him are the shots that teams are trying to give up; they are willing to funnel the ball to him instead of giving looks to other NYK players.

Thibs is good at this, but his teams do not make much noise come PO time. They are historically run down and injured. Consider that NYK has such a limited number of serviceable players due to poor drafting/developing and selling the farm for Bridges, and it's not exactly a combo that gets you excited about the future. || It's possible - they've run this one quite a bit with Hart. I think it's because teams are okay with Bridges taking as many 3's as he wants. || https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NqHAC/1/

^^ Numbers on Bridges as a PnR ball handler during his time in BKN. It isn't good. 

Many people say they should use him as an on-ball player like BKN. However, he’s not good at it; otherwise, they would be running him that way. 

He can't run on ball actions because you can go under every time and dare him to shoot. Teams are 100% willing to live with that every time. 

Towns: he can pass, he’s capable. Just not his strength, and that's no knock-on him. He's one of the best-scoring Bigs in the game. || I know you're trolling, but that's okay.

It refers to the Brunson and Towns two-man game (singular).

We dig deep into how they've run this one action (545 times) more than any other combination in the league and how it has had diminishing returns each month of the season as teams have accumulated more film and data on how to guard it.

Anyway, I hope you read it if you're into this NBA stuff and bring something to the discussion. If not, no worries. || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || Lots of wins vs. under .500 teams and losses vs. over .500 teams.

I'm excited to see what they do tonight vs. OKC. 

OKC was one of the teams that went without having their five-guard Towns and a more switchable player.

I'm interested in seeing if they post Towns on switches or avoid the action altogether and use Hart as Brunson's main PnR partner with Towns' spacing. || Please do not attack the person, their post history, or your perceived notion of their existence as a proxy for disagreeing with their opinions. || Live by Brunson, die by Brunson. Knicks fans wouldn't have it any other way.

The downside of OG and Bridges being so duplicative is that they could have gotten another creator, but with Brunson and Towns on the roster, you need defenders.

No team wins the exact same way. Perhaps, the Knicks aren't real contenders, but I think a suffocating Thibs defensive team exist in them if Robinson and McBride are healthy... and if OG and Bridges remember why they got the contracts they did.

The current Knicks team needs to mimic 2003-04 Pistons if they want to find their own way to contending. In the regular season, they need a bench lineup that can finish off games. Mike James, Lindsey Hunter, Corliss Williamson, Mehmet Okur, Elden Campbell, and Darvin Ham could finish off games in the regular season. It led to the starting lineup being able to play 40+ mpg in the playoffs.

Rasheed had the finishing but not playmaking second star issue that is currently present in Towns. Chauncey was by far the primary ball handler and shot creator. Tayshaun and Ben Wallace were in their defensive roles. And while Rip was a midrange sniper off screens, he wasn't a volume shooter who stretch the floor. Their spacing was entirely from Chauncey and Rasheed.

The question ultimately is whether the Knicks can elevate their defense to an elite level to make up for their lack of offensive versatility. || They need the reps to build the chemistry needed to take down the Celtics. But the situation still screams 4-6 minutes less per game for all 5 starters. || What makes you say that OG is a good shooter and Bridges is not? They’ve both been pretty inconsistent week to week, and right now they are separated by just 1.5% from behind the arc. Just a week ago, Bridges’ season 3p% was higher than OG’s. Also, Bridges’ midrange scoring is far superior to OG’s in terms of volume, efficiency & self creation. || I haven't really seen people clamoring for a bunch of Bridges on ball stuff at all. That isn't his game. He's not Klay level bad with the ball in his hands but he's a movement shooter. Still, I don't think you can index that much on Bridges PnR ball handling numbers on a terrible team with poor PnR partners to argue against it. 

Teams have not been going under screens for Bridges for almost the entirety of his career. He's a guy who you would much rather play tight and force him to have to drive or play-make than give him open shots, which though he has struggled from three this year, that is assuredly just a blip. Very good shooters don't just lose that ability all of a sudden and it has been creeping back up as is.

I mean he's currently shooting 42% on wide open threes this season and was at 38% on open threes last year. That isn't someone you go under a screen on. 

Also passing is one of Towns' strengths as a big - notably so. While he's not Jokic or even a Sabonis, he is quite a good playmaker for his size who has good vision and a willingness to make some pretty challenging attempts and convert on them. His *decision making* isn't great, but his touch and ability as a passer has been a career-long strength. || Even as someone who liked this article and found it insightful, my first reaction to the headline was the same. I think I would have preferred something like ""The Knicks are riding Brunson and Towns, but opposing teams are starting to figure them out""

To me that gets at the best part of the piece, which is combining the statistical observation that the two man action is becoming less effective and it's due to the tape of how opponents are guarding them differently. 

That said, I know there's a certain degree to which it doesn't matter what the headline is and people will not read the article in good faith. There's also the alternative angle in which sometimes having something easily ""correctable"" will make people engage with it more. So who knows.

In terms of the basketball philosophy questions getting posed about whether it makes sense to do the same thing over and over, I think it's an interesting question without a clear answer. On the one hand, there's the Bruce Lee quote about 1 punch practiced a thousand times is better than 1 thousand punches practiced 1 time which has some truth to it. I think employing it and seeing teams counter it throughout the regular season will also benefit the Knicks in a certain way so they can work through counters and not get surprised by that in the post season. 

On the other hand I do feel like the Warriors for example always saved the Steph-Draymond pick and roll spamming for high leverage situations. That way there wasn't as much tape for opponents to watch on something they knew would be effective and that there was more variety in their attack throughout a game and season. So there are trade-offs in both directions. The Knicks have chosen a direction though and I appreciate that there's a clarity and alignment in their approach despite the inflexibility that I think helps maximize what they get out of this group."

[OC Analysis]","If you’re reading this, you already have thoughts on Russell Westbrook. Outside of LeBron James, perhaps no player in the league has engendered capital-F Feelings in people over the years quite like him.

But I’m not here to relitigate a past that has little bearing on the present. The Nuggets brought the future Hall of Famer in to add some nastiness, bolster their playmaking, and, perhaps most importantly, fix the critical non-Jokic minutes. Has Westbrook been the answer, or has he been merely a lovely shade of porcine lipstick?

Westbrook has filled highlight reels with some big performances of late after moving into the starting unit for the injured Aaron Gordon. Lineup data is all based on relatively small samples, but predictably, the team’s defense cratered. The Nuggets’ core four (Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr., Christian Braun, and Nikola Jokic) give up[ 13.2 more points per 100 possessions](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/8/lineups#tab-four_factors) with Westbrook in Gordon’s place, a massive drop that takes the unit’s defense from average-ish to woeful. (That number was 9.8 until yesterday’s bizarre game against a Doncic and Irving-less Dallas squad, in which the Nuggets’ starters got absolutely blitzed out of the gate).

Gordon is the starting group’s best forward guardsman and a strong team defender, too. Replacing him with the smaller Westbrook predictably opened some cracks.

What wasn’t so predictable: replacing Gordon with Westbrook has taken an already good offensive lineup from Mile High to atmospheric heights. The starters with Russ have scored [130.6 points per 100 minutes,](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/8/lineups#tab-four_factors) eight more points than with Gordon, and in the 93rd percentile for any lineup. (Further swapping Murray for sharpshooting sixth man Strawther has been unbelievably potent, albeit on barely over 100 possessions).

*\[Thanks for reading! I've collected* [nearly a dozen video clips that can be viewed in context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or) *or at the various links throughout the article.\]*

What changes? Some of it is understandable. The Westbrook-led starters [get into transition at a a top-decile rate ](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/8/lineups#tab-context_trans_offense)despite being bad at forcing turnovers and defensive rebounding. Those two things usually jump-start the break, but Westbrook is more than happy to push off made baskets, too. He has always been an anthropomorphic NOS tank. Inject him into any offensive engine to watch that thing giddy up and *go:* \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

Notice that Westbrook wasn’t the one who made that basket; Synergy says he’s in the [16th percentile as a transition finisher](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/players/67001b9dff56573c7c3b3a0d/playtypes?seasonId=66ec94cbd172189f95bf08b2&competitionId=non-exhibition-54457dce300969b132fcfb34&compsCategory=1) this year. But there’s tremendous value in attacking unset defenses, particularly with Jokic around to clean up the mess. Since December 6th, Westbrook has driven [9.2 times](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives?DateFrom=12/06/2024&dir=D&sort=DRIVES) on just [63 touches](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/touches?DateFrom=12/06/2024&dir=D&sort=TOUCHES) per game, about the same rate as Giannis Antetokounmpo, and he has the [sixth-highest assist rate](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives?CF=DRIVES*GE*5:GP*GE*5&DateFrom=12/06/2024&dir=D&sort=DRIVE_AST_PCT) on those drives.

That passing sings. Despite (or perhaps *because* of\*)\* his gaudy assist totals, Westbrook has long been underrated as a pure passing technician. This forty-foot lefty bounce pass splitting two defenders is a sexy little number: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

Unsurprisingly, Westbrook had instant-oatmeal chemistry with Jokic in both directions. Westbrook’s ability to understand where teammates want to catch the ball meshes beautifully with Jokic’s Picasso creativity. Jokic misses here, but this is a perfect example of the mind meld the two players share: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

And Westbrook’s underrated cutting generates easy attempts for the team, even if he occasionally glitches on the shot. You don’t see too many airballed layups, but the fact that the Nuggets could even *create* a shot this good is still promising: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

Over time, Westbrook has gradually developed some ionic bonds with Jamal Murray, too. Murray has looked very comfortable next to Westbrook in more of a combo guard role. Westbrook is a historically great hit-ahead passer, so Murray’s been digging out clever positioning, secure in the knowledge that someone other than Jokic is capable of finding him: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

It’s not all good. The turnovers have been a problem, although the team is inclined to forgive errors of aggression. Westbrook’s usual shooting warts are still fully on display. The 32% he’s shooting from the three-point line this season is the best accuracy he’s posted since the 2016-17 season, nearly a decade ago. Westbrook has actually been quite good on his few corner threes, but he’s below [25% on above-the-break triples](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/201566/shooting?Season=2024-25), which he shoots far more often.

Defenses certainly don’t respect Westbrook’s shot, but it’s arguably less damaging on the Nuggets than on nearly any other team. Why? Well, in other places, defenses would put their center on Westbrook and let them play free safety. But on the Nuggets, all big bodies need to stay attached to Jokic. So even if Westbrook’s defender has the freedom to roam, they aren’t the sort of intimidating backline defenders who might usually roam the paint. In the best situations, Westbrook can turn a defense’s disrespect against them, like when he manufactures this switch of Spencer Dinwiddie onto Jokic: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

On the other side of the court, I once described Westbrook’s defense as making mean faces and running in random directions, but that was the old Russ. Present-day Westbrook has been sometimes awesome, occasionally abysmal, but surprisingly solid overall. Denver’s transition defense is not good, and Westbrook’s casual jogs back aren’t helpful. He’s still vulnerable to back cuts, and there are possessions where he doesn’t quite seem to know what he’s supposed to be doing: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

However, these possessions are far fewer than they used to be. Westbrook revitalized himself as an on-ball defender under Ty Lue for the Clippers in recent seasons, shedding some of his worst tendencies. This year, he’s posting his highest combined stock (steal+block) rate *ever* on a per-possession basis. Advanced metrics like [EPM ](https://dunksandthrees.com/player/201566/historical)and [LEBRON](https://www.bball-index.com/leaderboards-tool/) grade him as a well above-average defender overall, although they’ve taken more of a shine to his defensive impact than I have.

He’s spent 21% of his time guarding centers and power forwards, [per BBall-Index](https://www.bball-index.com/leaderboards-tool/), where his strength, low center of gravity, and all-around orneriness are assets. Notably, he stonewalled Victor Wembanyama one-on-one a few times during the Nuggets’ epic back-to-back games against the Spurs: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

Synergy defensive metrics are notoriously finicky, but as of yesterday morning, they showed that Russ has allowed a better-than-median point-for-possession on [*every playtype they track*](https://apps.synergysports.com/basketball/players/67001b9dff56573c7c3b3a0d/playtypes?seasonId=66ec94cbd172189f95bf08b2&competitionId=560100ac8dc7a24394b955ee&offense=false), whether it’s guarding the pick-and-roll ballhandler, closing out on spot-up shooters, chasing around screens or hand-offs, switching onto big men in the post, tagging rollers, or jailing dudes in isolation. Some of these are based on insanely small sample sizes, but it’s still impressive.

Of course, while Westbrook has done well individually on that end, the starting group’s overall defense has suffered of late. The Nuggets are perilously small without Gordon. None of the current starting group can consistently guard the sort of big forwards that litter the Western Conference like Gordon can, and the Nuggets sorely miss AG’s verticality and rebounding. Additionally, [teams have been lights out from deep against the Westbrook starting group](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/8/lineups#tab-shooting_defense_fg), punishing the lineup’s defensive rating.

It’s not Westbrook’s fault, exactly. Denver just needs what Gordon provides. The offense has been so incendiary that the defense’s relative woes mostly have been swept under the rug, but coach Mike Malone undoubtedly has noticed the difference.

Still, statistically, at least, Russ has been far better than could have been reasonably expected. He’s been a fine individual defender and neutral offensive force at worst (and I’d argue a smidge better than that), but his impact goes beyond the stats. It’s tricky to judge chemistry or leadership from a TV screen, but reporters have relayed how much [the team values his edginess](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6053848/2025/01/11/westbrook-jokic-nuggets-nba-triple-double/), something missing since Bruce Brown departed after the championship parade. Michael Malone mentioned in the preseason that [Westbrook’s trash-talking had become contagious](https://x.com/DNVR_Nuggets/status/1848451169074512330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1848451169074512330%7Ctwgr%5Ec631d2761b9dd338d1644e172e4b32f0c0a58796%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fftw.usatoday.com%2F2024%2F10%2Frussell-westbrook-nuggets-talking-shit-contagious-video), spurring a notoriously quiet Nuggets group. And I can’t get over this adorable clip of his excitement after an emphatic Christian Braun three from the other day: \[[video here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or)\]

Kids today talk about auras, but the kids from yesterday would say that the vibes are immaculate.

That does beg an obvious question. Things are going swimmingly right now, but with Aaron Gordon returning from injury yesterday, how does Malone optimize his rotation? “[I don’t look forward](https://x.com/NBABlackburn/status/1875340534358970716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1875340534358970716%7Ctwgr%5Ea7e7b7f8aca5ade858595f98fe8ba9808a82e0aa%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.si.com%2Fnba%2Fnuggets%2Fnews%2Fmichael-malone-s-statement-on-russell-westbrook-lineup-decision-01jgqjnp9ej7),” he replied coyly, and he’ll have a few days to figure it out as Gordon ramps up his minutes. But soon, he’ll need to make some hard decisions.

Because despite all the welcome success Westbrook has had next to Jokic… he’s virtually *only* had it next to Jokic. When those two are on the court together, the Nuggets obliterate opponents. In the \~750 possessions Jokic has sat and Westbrook has played, the [Nuggets have had a point differential in the second (2nd!) percentile](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/8/lineups?on=3914&off=1883#tab-four_factors).

The fundamental problem with every Nuggets team for the last infinite years is that they get destroyed in the non-Jokic minutes. Rather than alleviating that crisis, Westbrook has somehow further elevated the Jokic *on* minutes and worsened the Jokic *off* minutes! He’s both solution and problem.

That said, things aren’t quite as bad as they sound. The Nuggets with Westbrook and Murray together (no Jokic) have [only been outscored by -3.8 points per 100](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/8/lineups?on=3914&on=2631&off=1883#tab-four_factors) possessions, a respectably poor number. Recent lineups with those two, the shooter Strawther, the help defender Watson, and the fossil DeAndre Jordan have actually outscored opponents in their limited time together. So Malone may have found some units that can doggy-paddle in the deep end while the big man catches his breath, although we’ll need a much larger sample to be sure.

Should Westbrook stay on the court for tip-offs? Fans are clamoring for it; his 13-4 record as a starter sure is shiny, and certain lineup stats support it. With Gordon back, I believe Westbrook will return to a bench role (for now) but will play bigger minutes with the core group. Gordon, Braun, and perhaps even Jamal Murray or Michael Porter Jr., on nights where they don’t have it, may all see minutes shifted or reduced to make room for him.

Murray’s uneven start to the season and partial redundancy with Westbrook make him an intriguing Sixth Man option, but the team is simply too financially invested in him to consider a bench role any time soon. It is tempting to give Westbrook a longer look as the sole ballhandler, however. Despite some obvious shooting limitations, the Westbrook/Braun/Porter/Gordon/Jokic lineup has an elite point differentials in its 210 possessions. It’s unclear how that would hold up in the long term, but it’s worth examining — and in fact, Westbrook played two more minutes than Murray in the team’s comeback win over Dallas yesterday.

Regardless of what happens with the starters, Malone will likely ride hot hands for closing lineups. He has traditionally preferred stability to experimentation, but this question is far from settled.

For a guy brought in with the lowest of expectations (and salary), Westbrook has been a revelation. But is he merely deepening their already-existing dilemma? Or can he be part of the solution? We won’t have a definitive answer for several months, but I’ll be eagerly watching to find out.",314,47,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i0ctna/russell_westbrook_problem_or_solution_oc_analysis/,2025-01-13 07:27:27,"Great write up, really interesting insights and ideas there.

I wanted to cover one particular point that stood out to me: how teams will be defending Westbrook with Jokic on the floor. You make a certainly valid argument that all big bodies have to stay on Jokic, so teams can’t camp their Cs against Westbrook like it happened in LA. 

That said, if a team has a big enough PF to not get completely overwhelmed by Jokic (OKC with both IHart and Chet on the floor together, Rockets, Memphis, Wolves and maybe even Mavericks - PJ has built a reputation to play above his size - and LA with LBJ potentially taking on Jokic assignment like he did in Olympics), they can still put a 5 on Westbrook in a somewhat free safety role and a big 4 on Jokic. I feel like Westbrook’s shooting limitations will be exposed by good West teams in playoffs unless he gets to that 35%+ on open 3s. || Thank you for the writeup! One point that I think should be highlighted is his current contract. He's awful with the Lakers because his production simply didn't match his contact size and they can't bring in help to address his shortcomings. In Denver the situation is the complete opposite - his production is way better than what his contract would indicate. He should be completing against end of bench players and he's obviously way better than that for Denver. His contract may be one of the best for non-stars in the league right now. || Jokic is a player that works well with Westbrook because they can play off each other's strengths on offense. 

Jokic can run a P&R or DHO as the initiator and Westbrook can roll/dive to the basket and finish close or play-make. 

Since Jokic is a shooting threat and a Center, bigs have to stay on him or give up a switch instead of crowding Westbrook's roll or cuts. 

Jokic is also really good on the short roll and rolling to the basket. So, at any time, they can invert the DHO or P&R where Jokic is the screener or cutter, and then Westbrook can attack with the ball when Jokic fades. They can also counter if Jokic creates a quick give-and-go by pulling a couple defenders in a direction with pass/shot fakes off of a Westbrook pass. 

They have enough counters as a duo to force the defense into ""pick your poison"" scenarios. They're both players that are dangerous in transition, too.

The big thing with Westbrook on offense is that the less you need him to shoot off the dribble (and shoot in general) on the perimeter, the better off you are. If you can have an offense with a handful of backup options, one of which is to just give Jokic the ball and let him create, you can ensure there are possessions that don't end in Westbrook taking a jumper late in the clock while the defense sags off of him. 

Murray is also able work with Jokic in the P&R/DHO inversion game as well, which can open up off-ball cuts and whatnot for Westbrook. This works even better if Murray is hitting shots because then both him and Jokic have to be guarded closely on the perimeter - opening things up for Westbrook to dive/cut to the paint. || Thanks for reading! Hopefully, you enjoyed reading something about Westbrook that didn't mention ""triple-double"" once! You can see all of the video GIFs [in-context here](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/is-russell-westbrook-a-problem-or).

The Russ fit has been more fun than I expected, and can't wait to see how it holds up as the season goes on. || I think one really important aspect is that while Russ might be reliant on Jokic, he also makes Jokic a significantly better and more scoring oriented player.

These are his PER 36 numbers with and without westbrook on the floor until Jan 8th:

Jokic with Westbrook off: 25/13/11 on 61% TS (+4 relative TS%) (497 mins)   
  
Jokic with Westbrook on: 34/12/9 on 65% TS (+8 relative TS%) (635 mins) || I think about the big reason for Russ ""returning"" to form comes from Jokic being the perfect player in NBA history to pair with Russ. He's a roll man who can fade, screen, and share high BB IQ. 

Furthermore, the Vet Min makes is easier to ignore bad games from him, as posted to LAL where it's easier to call him out when he's making a max and they gave up crucial role players for him. 

I do think this is going to be good for the Nuggets this year, but end up being bad. Russ is outplayed g his contract, so they'll either have to pay him more or  let him walk. Also, it would might convince the FO to stand pat since Russ puts a nice bandage on everything. || [removed] || Bravo.  

i haven’t seen enough Nuggets games recently, since Westbrook became a starter, but I can’t imagine a Nuggets team surviving without AG in the starting lineup come playoff time, so I can’t see them extending this WB experiment any longer. 

There was a back to back earlier this year for Denver, and Gordon played spectacularly during the first game. It wasn’t the points. He was grabbing all the (offensive) rebounds, and making all the plays they needed to win the game. Next day, they played another game, and AG looked gassed. He just wasn’t himself, and Denver lost that game badly. Nobody else was doing the dirty work that AG typically does, including Gordon himself, so they lost. 

Westbrook does some of that dirty work, but he’s not going to compete with other Cs and PF for rebounds when they’re swarming the basket, and consistently win those battles. || Love the mention of what Russ brings to this team with his mentality. He’s one of the best teammates in basketball, and even when his team is down or has some other issue, he’s still gonna bring intensity and energy and that’s infectious.  || Why no one is discussing Braun going to the bench????  i like this lineup:  Westbrook as 1; Murray 2; Porter Jr 3; Gordon 4 and Jokic the 5!!!!!!!!!!  Denver plays FASTER and BETTER with Westbrook in the starting lineup!!!!!!!!!💪👏 || I know this wasn't the main point but on that Wembanyama clip I'm just thinking ""Dude you are at least a foot taller than Westbrook, why are you trying to get the ball 20 feet from the hoop and then face up and drive past him?"" || This is just my opinion, but I feel like I didn’t learn a single thing. Not just a you thing, but I feel like 95% of basketball content is like this. It reads like you went onto a couple of the meta analytic sites, dove into some of the numbers. THEN found tape to back up the numbers. Maybe most people don’t notice that, but to me this just reads A.I light. Like If I asked google why the nuggets went on a 3 game winning streak & it would generate your post as a response. 

You aren’t telling us why things are happening, you’re kinda just taking the box score & dressing it up a lil bit & then spitting it back at us in a neat format. 

Like if I asked u why the Celtics are kinda teetering recently. I felt like u would go find a bunch of statistics & you could probably pin point the things they are & aren’t doing well statistically. But someone like Jason Timpf for example. Almost always talks about things happening on the court. & I don’t mean “the team scores x amount more per 100 possessions when player x is off the floor compared to on” he’s touching on all the factors CAUSING the player to struggle or thrive. There’s a million different nuance things that happen throughout a game, let alone a season. But it’s like now everyone is over looking or just completely blind to the nuances of basketball. The stats are just a second hand account of what is actually happening on the basketball court. I feel like people don’t understand that. 

The article just feels really really hollow. Like yeah, you noticed Russ has made an impact. You’ve found where he has made the impact STATISTICALLY. But you didn’t break down the xs & os at all. So much more could have been added imo. & when I say more could have been added, I don’t mean finding more stats. I don’t want u to punch in more lineup data into cleaningtheglass. I hope u get where im coming from. 

Go find a random video of Jason Timpf talking hoops, then come back to your article. You’ll know exactly what I mean. If you do that, you’ll notice your article is like a car that looks pretty nice on the outside. But if u popped the hood or opened the door it would just be the frame. It’s missing the meat & potatoes. || [removed] || I had a similar thought while writing that, and I think it's a good point. Ran out of word count to go that deep haha but it's definitely something to watch. || Mavs tried putting lively on Westbrook and then got burned for layups when they tried to double Jokic. I don't think teams are going to want to play with that many mismatches. A 4 on Jokic means a 3 on Gordon. I don't see that working consistently enough to even try that. || Yes but also worth considering is both forwards (Gordon and MPJ) are pretty big. Remains to be seen how effective they will be. || Yeah, I only briefly mention that because I pretty much ran out of room lol, but he's definitely a value signing given the sheer number of minutes he's playing. || Exactly this, and he's also had a few years to realize that he's just not that guy anymore, so now he's more familiar with his role and has been playing with more control than when he was with the Lakers. || Jokic is the perfect player for literally everyone ha, but it does feel especially so with Westbrook. I'm not sure Westbrook has earned himself a bigger payday. He *deserves* one, but it's very hard for guys his age who are already on a minimum to gain a pay bump. And how many teams can actually find a role for him in which he can be effective? Not many Jokic's out there.

But if he finds a way to make himself a positive in the playoffs, you never know. || Lol yeah I had a feeling I’d get something like that from people. But Westbrook is worth critically examining this season! || This sub is for serious discussion and debate. Jokes and memes are not permitted. || Thanks! Yeah, my best guess is that Westbrook keeps playing 30+ minutes, and Malone just tweaks the rotation to get him more with Jokic than before. 

Totally agree that Gordon is essential to Denver's success, although he hasn't been quite up to his usual standard this year defensively, IMO. Could just be health, though || Thanks for the feedback.  You made me think a little more critically about my article-building philosophy. Please let me know your thoughts:

Everything I do starts from watching ball. I try to hit four boxes with my player or team breakdowns: stats, film, analysis, engagement. The first two are easy as long as you're willing to actually watch a ton of games and not just do clips/highlights, etc. I try to let the eyes guide the stats I look at, but they work in tandem. Statistics are helpful for providing a framework for the discussion. Film clips are useful for illustrative purposes or for showing things that are tough to describe in words (e.g., Tosan Evbuomwan's funky push shot).

The third is the hardest, and what separates good content from great. I'm always trying to make sure I check that box, but I can only write what I learn, and sometimes I might just not hit a high enough level. Depending on the reader, it may hit home or it may not. I'm disappointed it missed the mark for you this time.

The fourth, engagement, is me trying to make sure the reader enjoys what they're reading. It can't be a bullet point of facts (I mean, it *could*, but then what value am I providing?). In my ideal world, my blogs are enlightening and entertaining. This one is hard to get right, too, but I'm mindful of it, at least.

It also needs to be at least a little approachable. As I mentioned, I write a blog, and I need to keep the audience in mind. For example, I can say that the Nuggets almost never run spain pick-and-rolls or double-drags, but I've tried stuff like that in the past and basically get booed off the stage by bored readers (or worse, crickets because nobody reads at all). So there's a fine balance.

Anyway, this was a long-winded way for me to say I'm always trying to get better, little bit by little bit. It's not an overnight change, but I look at where I started when I began writing, and I can at least see the progress. || CAPITAL LETTERS aren’t necessary to stress well constructed sentences and paragraphs. Please SEPARATE your comments into more clear PARAGRAPHS. || [deleted] || Mavs were +2 with Jokic and +3 with Westbrook on the floor in a -11 overall game: they just got - uncharacteristically for Nuggets opponents - destroyed by Denver’s bench. Mavs lost not because of Westbrook-Jokic connection, but because they went stagnant on offense themselves in Q4 due to Denver adjustments and missing 3s and then Dinwiddie iso-balling and opportunities generation is not anywhere close to Kyrie or Luka level.

Also playing Nuggets with AG and Westbrook on the floor together means the key would be to limit inside opportunities and sag off them on the perimeter since both are not great shooter. Nuggets can post up AG like they did vs Mavs (or like they did vs Heat in Finals), but I think most teams would be happy betting on that instead of having Jokic dissect their defenses: you just got to pick your poison vs great teams and I feel like that’s the best bet, plus somebody like J-Dub on AG may not be the end of the world, though he will be worn out defensively to produce much on offense for OKC. || I just hope a team doesn't get duped by this insane career turn around. || Could be, altho that’s rarer — Milwaukee, Memphis, maybe Lakers if they trade for a center. I do worry for Denver’s sake that defenses will find ways to punish the Nuggets non-shooters (not just Westbrook) in the playoffs. 

Thanks for clicking through! || Gordon had the best percentage from 3 on the team. Sagging off him isn't going to happen. Sagging off westbrook worked with the Rockets because he was basically the 5 so you cant be punished by guarding him with a 5. Against the mavs, their defense is better with Luka out. If he's playing there's nobody he could even guard. Playing the 5 on Westbrook means you have 5 mismatches on the court and that's just not going to work. || I think that most teams know Westbrook is in a situation that maximizes his strengths right now. And guys his age pretty much never bounce back from the minimum once they’re on it.

Denver might be the only such team at risk!"

Coupled with its payroll being exceptionally low considering the output plus the plethora of picks coming to them in the next 6 years, what should the expectations really be for OKC?

I think it goes without saying SGA getting an MVP (assuming health) is a very good possibility. It wouldn’t be surprising in the least if they continue as is for the season and he wins it this year. 

What should the over under expectations for SGA MVPs be (obviously assuming health of himself and likely front runners)? I think he’s still not necessarily better as a 1 to 1 comp to Jokic but after that, vs giannis/Luka I think he’s a fair pick. He’s more likely to win multiple assuming the winning ways of OKC. I’d say he wins one this year and should be expected to win at least 1 more by 2031. The wild card could be simply Wemby gets a good teammate or two and he’s now owning the league lebron-esq.

In terms of titles, again, it would seem like the west is open albeit a surefire bloodbath of a playoffs come June. They could’ve easily been in the WCF last year and this year I think they’re easily looking like the favorites to come out of the west. To me, I’m thinking they might fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you see it, go through the same sets of disappointments as this Celtics team did for several years. Making the WCF or finals itself and losing a few before winning it all.

I think the expectations are certainly 1 title in these next 6 seasons and yet a massive disappointment akin to the young KD Russ Harden Thunder if they fail to do so. Upside, it would be both surprising and somewhat unsurprising if they use a lot of the picks and maybe a good young player or two to bring in a true monster costar for SGA like KD to the warriors and see the Thunder capture 3 in that 6 years.

What are your thoughts and expectations on the Thunder considering their position today with low payroll and insane amounts of picks over these next 6 years?",398,150,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1i460q1/with_the_fact_that_okc_has_the_best_record/,2025-01-18 06:55:11,"They're going to have to pay so many people in the near future... I still think a title or two is expected, but can they pull it off with such a young team UNTIL it's time for the payday? Idk bro || They just have to continue to be ruthless about getting rid of mistakes and fixing mistakes. I look at the transaction leading up to acquiring Poku and getting rid of Poku for guidance. Biggest mistake a small market franchise can make is feeling trapped by their younger players coming up on extensions. If your guys want more than you want to pay, don't extend them, move on and move on quickly. Have to trust that your future drafts will create better assets.

Going forward, they have to shed veterans as younger guys come up to replace them. Sure, they'll have to pay SGA, Chet, and Jalen Williams. But through quality drafting, they can shed useful veterans like Kenrich Williams, Alex Caruso, Lu Dort, Isaiah Joe, and Aaron Wiggins etc. when the time comes. What's going to hurt is that you always have to trade those guys a year earlier than you want to stay ahead of the curve.

The young Celtics are a good comp, but OKC can't generate the revenue that the Celtics can even if the Thunder won the title. So going all in like the Celtics have with all their super sized salaries... shouldn't be in the cards for the Thunder. || I think 26-27 will be the crux of it because Chet and JDub will need to get paid, plus Shai will be on the last year of his contract, so they’ll have to sign an extension. Hartenstein will still be on the books for 28.5M - which is good on the one hand but doesn’t leave space for multiple max contracts. 

If OKC hasn’t at least made the finals by 26-27, I think they’ll be forced to break it up to some extent- similar to the Celtics shifting Marcus Smart even though he was the heartbeat of the team and recently DPOY. My question is who would be the one to go for OKC, and will they sell high and improve the roster like the Celtics did, or will they only get pennies on the dollar for eg an oft-injured Holmgren? || They have a lot of resources to go all in with. You can only have so many players on your team at any one time, you still need to pay the talent you have, there are caps/aprons.

They have a chance to dominate like few teams before them, and have a lot of wiggle room to figure out how to get it right. But it will always be hard to win the chip in the NBA. || It's a team having an incredible season and most are expecting a few more to come. However, I'm really just holding out on my judgement until the playoffs. 

I think they need to convert the awesome regular season this year into at least a late playoff run to convince the doubters that this can be a dynasty in the making. || First of all, a statue for Presti when he retires. What we are seeing in Oklahoma is unprecedented to such a huge extent that it is only right he gets recognised for masterminding this. He turned a decent team into a truckload of assets. 

Second of all: Cap will hurt. Some of these guys will not be on the team in one or two years, simply because it is unaffordable. In 26/27 they have to make decisions on Chet and Jalen Williams, both are extension eligible from that point on and both can argue (if Chet is healthy for most of the next season) that they are worth a max. At that point OKC still has SGA, Joe, Wiggins on the books. You could see that being the core five with pieces added from picks and it isn't a bad path. But then the season after, SGA is due an extension... 

I think we'll see lots of players move to other teams in off-season moves, simply because OKC can't afford to keep them all on board, I really wonder if the 'ex-Heat' effect takes place and some of those guys really cool off in other systems and set-ups. 

But, the truth is, if SGA, Chet and J Will are the core of your team, you are competing and I can see them get numerous titles, starting this year. || It’s so wild to see the Thunder in the exact same situation they were in over 10 years ago. Elite, young talent with lots of young depth and a board of assets. Everyone for sure thought the Thunder were going to run the league for a decade. 

Should be very interesting to see how this cycle pans out || Presti appears to be patient.

He'd best not be too patient, because SA, DAL, MEM & HOU are various degrees of not too far behind.  
So if OKC isn't at full health for their playoff runs over the next couple years (looking at you, Chet), their window could close faster than people expect.

And this year, the Celtics are still the favorites, imo. || My guess is they do what they did last offseason - sell the bulk of their immediate post lottery picks for future assets until a huge fish becomes available to pair with SGA, Jalen and/or Chet. || As long as they are able to find partners they can keep trading out of the first round for more future firsts plus interest. There isn’t even really a clock on them using all of the picks by 2031 so I would expect they keep drafting a player with their highest pick and trading most of the others. 

However, they won’t be able to pay everyone and they might go into the higher tax brackets for a couple championships but after a couple seasons of repeater tax and trade restrictions (where no championship is guaranteed and you can still lose a season to injury or team malfunction or just running into a hot team) they’ll start bleeding free agents and still be an expected top 4 seed for a decade.

Or they could make a couple KD level trades and fuck up the contracts and burn through those picks trying to salvage the wrong player. || This is a random aside, but I need to know what they are going to do with all those picks? They already have a great roster without many holes. They have two guys who will secure max deals already on the team with Williams and SGA. Chet will probably command a big salary too. That limits how much money $$ they'd want to add in a trade. I guess they can use the picks to upgrade depth and fill out the roster but it seems like they will have multiple firsts that they can't even use. Does anyone have ideas on how that will play out? (It's obviously a good ""problem"" to have, just genuinely curious) || One thing to expect is that payroll stat to not keep. We’re gonna be paying JDub and Chet max extensions soon. || I still think San antonio has the best position in the entire league. Locking up Wemby has set them up for the future. OKC is going to be a juggernaut for a long time, even if they cant pay their guys, they can get other guys through the draft, it'll be a constant rotating slot of good players. || One question that I have, and this may have been info that I missed, is where are they planning to put Chet once he returns? I get the idea that basketball is getting more and more position-less, but there’s something so appealing to Chet being at the 5. Do they move Hartenstein down to the 4, or Chet? || a package of SnT Jalen Williams + a gazillion of picks for a big 3 should be on the horizon of thought since now even. Gotta solidify the winning time frame. || Less than it seems but still quite a bit. Maybe 4 finals appearances and a title || They could still trade those guys who start needing a big pay and draft good talent in || The future is near unpredictable in this league at a team level. That Suns team that was in the Finals 4 years ago? There's one player from that team still on the roster. Hell, the Dubs team from 2 years ago who won has changed drastically.

OKC has to win now cause they can't pay everyone, so things will shift rapidly. We'll see how Presti handles a contender for the first time in a very long time. || I don't know why you focus so much on Shai. He's phenomenal, but I haven't seen enough to say he's a top player. Team success is boosting him as a player imo. He's, in my mind at least, closer to Tatum than to Giannis and Luka. There is no shame in being top5 player on the best squad in the NBA.

I would personally focus on what THEY can achieve. Using Tatum again, he doesn't seem bothered he didn't win FMVP neither did Steph. I believe Tatum should win his and Steph should have 3 instead of 1 (4 but whatever , you can have one KD), but the NBA business is what it is (wink, wink Magic Johnson as a rookie, wink, wink).

I wouldn't guarantee them a chip, the parity in the league is crazy. But then again both Boston and Denver had a pretty ...I don't want to say it but there it goes: easy way to the chip. Stars have aligned and things went the right way. Looking at OKC it's easy to imagine they'll have a year like that, if it isn't THIS year already || If they don’t win this year or next then expect the majority of those picks going to other teams in trades for win-now players. || Cap situation has largely been discussed in other replies: salary is going to balloon in 26-27 (Chet and Dub extensions start) and even moreso in 27-28 (Shai supermax)

Fan base is split I’d say 70/30 between ‘were good enough to win now, we need to hang on to our cheap pieces (largely Topic) and utilize our picks during the draft to add cheap talent to support the main cast once we have to move off the ~15-20M a year guys to keep them’ and ‘we should make a trade now to ensure maximum success in the next 2, and to a lesser extent 3, years while we have the full supporting cast and the main 3 on relatively cheaper contracts’

I think that regardless of your perspective it’s fair to say OKC will look pretty silly if we hang onto the draft assets and 2027 comes around without a championship.  || Just like with KD, Harden and WB trio, they will let guys go over time. Window is super short. || One little discussed aspect of the luxury tax that people don't really mention is where the tax money *goes*.  Right now, there are 14 teams expected to pay over 572MM in luxury taxes that get spread out to the non-tax paying (but above salary floor) teams.  I expect the Cavs and Pels to drop below the tax line to bring us back to 567MM to be split 50% to the league and the rest between the 18 non-tax teams, or ~16MM.  Next year will be much higher, with the Celtics and Suns paying over 400MM in projected luxury tax between just the two of them.  

Assuming OKC can stay below the luxury tax line this year and next year (which they are currently projected to with their entire current roster signed), the taxpaying rest of the league will be paying for OKC's team. || Picks are based on the trading teams record, right?  Are they going to get high picks or are they protected?  I agree with a previous commentator that the window is short, you have a really good nucleus now, IMO go for it and make the moves for a championship in the next 2-3 years || Just depends on if they draft well. They will have to lose some guys deserving big contracts in a few years. Can’t pay everyone, which is kind of lame if you drafted your whole team. || I’d be surprised if they don’t win at least 3 rings. More than that is a tough ask with a possible GOAT candidates on the horizon in Hector Banana Bread. || If they don't win multiple championships, like 3+, it will be a disappointment. But I imagine Thunder fans would be fine if they can just get one lol. Most teams' fans would be. || maybe 1. the new cap and aprons are going to mean they have to pay way to many guys and they won’t be able to keep most of them || OKC... built for the regular season.  They couldn't even win with KD, Russ and Harden.  

They have the most overrated front office. || There are two variables that will determine if they win championships. First, is SGA good enough? Second, Chet's health. I can very easily see a scenario where they pay Chet, lose depth, and then he's hurt all the time and they go from having endless depth and assets to one superstar and a guy who's good but only plays 30 times per year."

And potentially incorrect position.,"General realistic rules:

 +overall size = stronger but slower
Size can be either in the form of fat or muscle as long as it 'seems' realistic 

Elite athletes have mostly elite level genetics (and access to assistance)

However someone like Trae may never be big as Jrue but potentially could be like younger Curry size.

Eg.
Obviously Zion could be in shape. But what if he lost a LOT.
But what if someone like Ben Simmons just bulked and actually played Center.
Should someone like Onyeka Okongwu slim down to not go against Centers? 
Does Desmond Bane or Brunson need all that size year round?
Should some of those long athletic wings like Trey Murphy/Jaden McDaniels try to get the size of PG? Or would they be better we go larger like JJJ or Julius Randle? 

Some other ones which I don't think would be beneficial but interesting to watch would be like: what if KD actually tried to gain muscle? Or Luka got shredded?

On the opposite side, I think someone like Giannis is an example of fully maxed physical potential.

He was a positive outlier before but instead he’s lost some of that advantage to still be at a disadvantage in strength. || Giannis is interesting because young Giannis was so fluid with a shot to match. His muscle growth was so fast and jarring that I think it was at the loss of a lot of fluidity. Think Dwight shooting free throws where he just tried to flick his wrists as soft as possible. I imagine it’s really hard for most players to find what works best because their role might not be the same every year. Anthony Davis has put on a lot of size to play the 5 position he has asked for almost a decade to avoid. Might be a whole different player if he had stayed slender and mobile like a KD. || Charles Barkley is classic example of this. Once he lost weight he was almost unstoppable || Keegan Murray is kinda interesting here. He bulked up to play the 4, where I feel like his natural position is the 3. He's now the best defender on the Kings, and is one of our better rebounders now, but his 3 pt percent has kinda dropped which might be due to the added muscle affecting his shot. 
His rookie year he was a 3 pt sniper but got bullied on the boards and on defense. Makes me wonder if he could have become a good defender without the added muscle since we still mostly have him guard on the perimeter, or maybe he'll start hitting his 3s at a higher rate with his added size || I have been suspicious the Bulls are playing Williams out of position at the 4 spot his whole career and he is really a small forward.

His footspeed isn't fantastic but his size and strength should help him stick with any quicker wings he may match up with defensively. On offense that same size and strength should help him post up or shoot over guys from beyond the arc.

He is a mystifying player to watch regress.

Trouble is the Bulls dont really have any starting power forwards on the roster, so Pat is kind of stuck at the 4 and the Bulls are stuck with him at the 4. || I always thought when you play a game like basketball it’s less than optimal to play with a lot of muscle as the game is centred around cardio and being able to carry out movements for a long amount of time. 

I don’t believe there is a correlation between aesthetics and performance. We often have a bias that athletes must look like bodybuilders to be optimal at their jobs. || Trae will always be undersized even compared to an undersized Curry: he is at least an inch shorter (probably 2) and has 2 inches less of wingspan. Getting more muscle wouldn’t solve this and Trae doesn’t seem to be the guy to enjoy physicality like Bane and Brunson, who are also undersized, but use their strength to bully taller and lankier defenders. If both Bane and Brunson wanted to play more finesse style of ball, maybe they could drop a bit of size, but they would need to become even more skilled than they already are.

Zion can’t lose A LOT of weight, that’s just his body type. That said, he could absolutely drop to heavy pre-Miami LBJ weight (250 or so pounds) and that would help his longevity tremendously while he would still maintain physical advantage over anybody in the league.

Simmons doesn’t have any Cs skills to play position full-time: he doesn’t provide much rim protection compared to players of his size and he has next to no footwork and barely any touch to score in the paint. He was at his best as a perimeter stopper capable of defending on switches 1-5 and has always been limited on offense, but if he was to gain weight, he would lose even more ability on defense (won’t keep up with guards at all) while still providing barely any value on offense.

Okongwu is almost the exact opposite: he basically has no skills outside the paint. Playing even PF without ability to drive (let alone without a decent shooting ability) is next to impossible in modern league, especially considering Okongwu is respectable defender on perimeter, but far from defensive stopper.

Trey and Jaden are probably better off as PG clones, but they could theoretically try to get to JJJ size. The thing is, size is not the only thing that matters: JJJ is an excellent inside defender and is a good inside scorer, so Trey and Jaden would need to develop those skills to be effective PFs. Considering where both players are (respectable 3-D players, Trey develops driving game) it’s just easier to catch up to PG in skills.

KD gaining muscle would have probably turned into Giannis: great inside scorer that would have most likely lost most of his outside shooting ability. Do we remember that Giannis shot career best 35% on 3s in his rookies season before starting to bulk up? KD probably wouldn’t be flirting with 40% career shooting on 3s with more muscle.

Luka is an interesting case: yes, he is not dunking or breaking down defenses with his speed like he did in his first 2-3 seasons, but he is overpowering any defender opponents throw at him with his sheer size. He is like a smaller but more skilled as a ball handler Jokic: there is no defender who can reliably stop either 1v1 due to combination of size, weight, vision and skill. I’m not sure shredded Luka would be a better player today: “fat” version can take on physicality and beating inside, though I’m sure less weight would have prolonged his career, similar to Zion. || Caleb Martin being a 6'5, 215 pound pf is suboptimal for sure. I don't think bane can afford to lose much weight if any, part of why he's such a good defender despite having a negative wingspan is that he's hard to bump off and create enough space to get a decent shot off. He loses weight and he'll end up like Tyler herro, able to stay in front of guys but can't contest very well when they bump him back || Looks like Jaylen got jacked this year and he looks stiffer and a little slower and his shooting not as good || Harden is in better shape this year, but he could still stand to be a little leaner I think.  Been that way a lot of his career.  Guess you can’t be that critical given how good he has been.  

Jonas Valanciunas.  His rookie year he was a lot skinnier and more mobile.  Raptors asked him to bulk and he lost a lot of that quickness.   He could probably stand to lose 40 or 50lbs and it would be night and day for him, IMO.  Maybe he loses a little bit of strength, but that wasn’t ever really a big problem even when he was thinner. || I love this question. KD would be very interesting to watch if he had developed into a PF/C instead by adding a tiny bit more muscle. Always wondered how he would play if he was an actual big instead. If he focused on skills near the rim in college, I think he would be an excellent rim protector combined with his shooting touch making him the first unicorn big. || Embiid. If Embiid played his entire career at 240-250 pounds, as the geat bigs of the 80's and 90's did, he'd of had a far more healthy career. Instead, despite putting up some historic scoring numbers, he's played his entire career 40+ lbs too heavy. As a result of that, his strength and conditioning have always been suboptimal. Embiid has never dedicated himself to getting in shape. || I don’t think Zion is operating an optimal body composition.

Bro is holding onto more McDonalds than I’ll eat in a lifetime. || Taking Draymond Green’s body on this one. Skillset doesn’t match his physical metrics. Backpack shot, he’s solid in the paint, but lacks height. Tweener height and a belly on him. He has a handle, while not great, is respectable enough to push the break. He had a better package of offensive go-to’s in college that dissipated when he started playing heavy minutes for the Warriors.

Then again, there are a bunch of pudgy boys who can ball. From the YMCA to the NBA. || [removed] || [removed] || I think about this with OG whenever I watch him play now. I’m sure he was hearing the “able to guard 1-5” conversations and wanted to bulk to be apart of them, but he’s lost a lot of agility and his game just seems way more laborious. They play different roles, but I’m a little worried Jaylen Brown is headed down a similar path || I think Zion Williamson shouldve been forced into more of an on ball role and forced to keep his weight under 270 (really 260).

Zion’s rebounding and rim protection are typically bad for a starting big, but he has really great playmaking, transition, and rim finishing. Let him loose in a transition based, one read, on ball role (think Russell Westbrook/Pre Injury Ben Simmons) and take advantage of teams need to collapse or get out the way when he has a full head of steam. I think Zion Williamson could be a superstar in this league, but from a team building perspective, a hyper athletic on ball player is much easier to build around than a 4 who doesnt have a great jumper or defensive fundamentals. || You also have to consider the immense mental differences in different positions. Of course the sport is moving very position-less but playing centre vs PG are two very different mindsets, let alone physical needs and skillsets || Luka needs to be much leaner- he would be talked about in the same breathe as prime Curry if he was in shape (not invterms of playstyle but impact) . Brunson's build actually suits his playstyle- him and Lowry have that shorter bulldog build that allows them to get to their spots. || I don’t know but I remember Curry bulking up a bit and temporarily losing some of his finishing touch and three point shooting in 2022. || AD is a 4 not a 5.... KD is a 3 not a 4 that's why he lies about his height.... Lakers are idiots for thinking AD can play the 5 still can't believe this is a thing || That’s true, but I’d imagine he’d gained some defensive upside, as well as maybe ability to just not get bullied running offball. 
Plus his role has kinda been a bit of a mess his whole career from playing behind Simmons/Toby, then Harden, Embiid, then 24/7 injuries in the team bounces him everywhere from sole creator to 3rd option to 1st option. 

But you’re right and I’m interested to see his growth. || De'Aaron Fox did something similar a few years ago, or at least that's what the reports said at the time. He put on a bunch of muscle for 21-22 and it hurt his speed. Came back lean and fast the next year and made all-nba. || It’s cause he gained fat, he probably dirty bulked. Once he cuts that fat off and gets shredded he’ll be back to prime Lebron || Hasn't exactly turned out badly for Giannis though.. || Davis is an interesting example I think you could argue either way. If he doesn’t put on the weight his outside shot is likely better, but still not what you want for a 4 in 2025. Conversely his size and position change has led to him developing his touch closer to the basket to a level he easily may not have gotten to

Based on younger ADs potential it’s hard not to assume he should’ve stayed thin, but I think it’s a bigger question mark than some might assume || I seemed to remember Giannis not being a shooting threat early in his career but I might be mistaken. I definitely don't remember a fluid jump shot... || I think Giannis's jump shot is mostly the result of bad coaching. Now that Doc is encouraging him to shoot he's shooting a lot better. || Completely agree, Keegan is in that Herb Jones, Trey Murphy kind of build when he is best suited as a pure wing instead of a 4. I honestly feel like he had to play 4 with arrival of Derozan, who is not a 2 anymore with his lack of burst, but honestly I’d rather Kings prioritised Murray’s development as his rookie season was extremely promising."

He not only continued to play at a high level, he also has looked better since the season started & with the All-Star reserves coming out tomorrow, I thought it'd be fun to go through his case for it & see where other fanbases also stand here(I'm a Heat fan).

Right now, he's averaging 25/5/6 per 75 possessions on 58% eFG & 62% TS. The only players that matched are Shai, Giannis, Jokic & Curry.

Starting with the impact metrics(EPM by Dunks and Threes; LEBRON by BBall-Index; DPM by Darko; eRAPTOR by Neil Paine), he ranks:  
\- 18th in expected O-EPM with +3.5  
\- 9th in actual O-EPM with +4.2  
\- 17th in O-LEBRON with +2.5  
\- 35th in O-DPM with +2.0  
\- 18th in O-eRAPTOR with +3.5

He ticks off the having good production, elite efficiency(especially given the volume, responsibility, role AND team context), and he also has the advanced metrics in his favour, too.

By all but 1 metric, he's ranked in the top 20 on offense.

Also, do note that I'm focusing on the offensive side. Defensive metrics haven't liked him at all this year(for some, it's the worst in his career). But that matters less to me for things like the All-Star game. This isn't about who's better or who would you rather have on a contending team, where more factors come into play.

What simply matters is what is the job/role for that player in their context & how well are they doing it. What does the team need from that said player & has that player done what they needed them to do?

For Herro, it's an easy yes & he's done it extremely well

He's been their engine offensively. You can see in the tracking/usage stats where he ranks on the team. He's been tasked with a lot of responsibility, both as on/off ball scorer, ball handler, passer & help with spacing/shooting. The offense also revolves around his skillset.

Here's a [link to his tracking & usage stats](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-60ewy0xz2yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1807%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De84c5022f0335573f1aeb2c24a8ab3f18a57a0e9) per BBall-Index compared to everyone on the Heat. Leads the team in touches per 75, ball dominance, offensive involvement rate, on-ball action are, true usage, and scoring possessions per 75. 

Even when looking at just the playtypes(PNR/ISO/Post ups/Handoffs), he ranks first by a good margin:

\- Herro: 10.4  
\- Butler: 6.2  
\- Rozier: 5.1  
\- Bam: 4.9

Herro has been doing it all for the Heat. That's a lot of offense going through him & actions directly involving him to score and yet, he's still putting up highly efficient numbers across the board.

The Heat's offensive rating with him on is 115.5 but take him off & it drops to 107.8 - that's the difference between 10th & 29th. Even in this stretch where the Heat's offense had significantly dropped for the year, he still drags it. In 2025, it's 114.1 with vs 106.8 without.

We also seen his production without Butler. In 20 games without Butler, Herro averages 25pts per 75 poss on 57% eFG & 61% TS with 28% usage. His stats & efficiency don't differ. & those points have been needed a lot. When games are in the mud(they have been a lot lately), you'll take any scoring you can get.

Per Cleaning the Glass, the offense is in the 71st percentile with him on and his on/off is in the 96th(!) percentile. Clear impact on the offensive end.

That's third box ticked for me.

Moving onto the ""eye test""(how he does it) and basketball.

Starting off with his shooting. That has been the biggest difference & it comes down to a change in shot diet & upping the 3pt rate. He's an *elite* shooter. He's 12th in 3pt attempts per 100 at 13.5 & shoots 40.5%. Out of 59 qualifying players with 10 3s, he's 13th in %.

Per BBall-Index shooting metrics, he ranks:

\- 7th in 3pt shooting talent  
\- 7th in 3pt pull up talent  
\- 9th in C&S 3pt talent  
\- 1st in deep 3pt talent

\- 2nd in 3pt shot making  
\- 6th in 3pt pull up shot making  
\- 5th in C&S 3pt shot making  
\- 1st in deep 3pt shot making

It's this change in his shot diet for more 3s that got him the 10th highest TS% increase over a single season since 2014, amongst on-ball guards. This year, it was the second highest behind Garland.

He went from a 45.3% 3pt rate to 55.0%. A 10% increase leaning on a skill that he's been *elite* at for the last few years.

He's the only player to rank top 10 in both 3pt pull up & C&S 3pt talent. Deadly on or off ball. There are also only 8 players to rank top 25 in 3pt shot making, pull up shot making & C&S shot making.

& it's that ability to do so in various ways. He can simply be a spot up shooter, helping with the spacing & making him a dangerous off-ball player. He shoots 48% on wide open 3s + 44% on corners. You CAN'T leave him open. His spacing & gravity helps & makes life easier.

[Here's a link to his C&S 3pt & off-ball video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580807857070146)

That off-ball ability & gravity also turns into this. There are multiple instances where he makes the defense panic if comes off a screen or even looks like he's about to go for a 3pt. That's the level of a shooter that he is. This helps with any off-ball movement run for him

[Here's a link to his gravity video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580809929089386)

But it's the handoff + off the dribble where the scoring has taken a jump - he does take 10 PNRs + handoffs combined. Being able to create space for 3s off dribble or off handoffs adds unpredictability. It makes defense have to over play him & he can still get a 3 off in other ways.

[Here's a link to his off dribble 3s video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884580812005204320)

That's why his efficiency looks like this. Per BBall-index, his stable PPP:

\- 1.12 points on handoffs  
\- 1.18 on spot ups  
\- 1.24 in transition  
\- 1.10 on off ball screen  
\- 0.94 in PNR

Only 6 other players score at least 1.0 PPP in the first four & 0.9 in the PNR - Dame/Shai/Haliburton/Powell/Pritchard/Edwards

What this all led to is an improvement inside & everywhere else(including his passing). 1st, he took away his inefficient mid-ranges. He's now also shooting 63% within 4ft & 54% within 4-14ft. Out of 64 players with at least 20 2pt per 100, he's 13th in %

The biggest difference is the driving ability & creating off dribble. There's a DRASTIC difference in how aggressive he looks + how he embraced going through contact. There have also been more counters + better moves to shift & get open then burst to the rim.

That's why there's now a more willingness to attack & get to the rim. His rim rate is at 17%(2nd highest in career) - a big improvement from 11% & 13% the last 2 years. Combine that with the shooting, this has been as best of a 3 level scoring season he's ever had

[Here's a link to his drives video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884583295725216122)

What's also been better is the passing & playmaking. That has taken a significant step from last year & has been as big of a difference maker in his impact as everything stated above. This was another major flaw/weakness & it simply isn't like that anymore

Some stats per BBall-Index amongst 93 on-ball players:

\- 23rd in playmaking talent

\- 24th in passing creation quality

\- 21st in box creation

\- 16th in P&R creation rate

There's been a clear increase in volume + responsibility as a passer & that was a needed thing to learn how to balance that with the scoring.

And when you compare him to himself, that's also where you see the drastic improvement. [Here's a link to his tracking passing stats over the last three years](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-ns8j3sx15yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D735%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De2e6168f4471a0a51d010be42925096be56ea87d)!

[Here's a link to his passing off drives & PNR video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884587337503383633)

This is where you see the improved decision making. He's been reading the defense a lot better. And with him being a more willing driver + more aggressive, these windows open up a lot more.

This also has led to him being way more blitzed and the results were better than expected.

[Here's a link to 6 min of him getting blitzed video](https://x.com/JohnJablonka_/status/1884587341236339164)

Finally, let's also touch on the competition. His comp for the 2 backup guards: Cade/Dame/Garland/Ball/Trae/Haliburton/LaVine

[Here are the metrics for all of them.](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fis-tyler-herro-an-all-star-this-year-v0-a53owp3n5yfe1.png%3Fwidth%3D812%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D65d771e844f1b86ec3d1264f56ab51ca6c8f07e2)

Herro ranks: 5th, tied 4th, 6th, tied 4th, tied 6th, 5th, and 5th

I'd take Herro over Cade & LaVine. & I'd take Garland over Herro 100%. There's little argument for me for either option.

That leaves Hali/Dame/Ball/Trae. All have strong cases over one another & it just depends on preference + what you value more. For me, he is cut short based on the competition with Garland + either Dame/Hali over him. But that also changes nothing about his season.

HE is an All-Star calibre player. He HAS played like an All-Star. With the improvements that he made & how it all has translated for this season, especially considering the circumstances & the situation, he has taken huge steps & growth.

**So, to answer the question, he has played like an All-Star this year**

**Let me know your thoughts on his case & if you have him over these guards too! Thanks for reading & I appreciate you taking the time if you got to the end**",155,69,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1icwt52/is_tyler_herro_playing_like_an_allstar_this_year/,2025-01-29 10:48:13,"I think he’s an All Star. 

The Heat have a better record than the Pistons and Hawks, with Herro also being guarded tightly and being leagues above Cade and Trae in scoring 62.2% TS for Tyler vs 54.7% and 55.8% for Young and Cunningham whilst being a good playmaker himself. 

Herro’s stats are similar to Dame, but I give the edge to Herro based on the fact that his team are only three games behind the Bucks while Dame doesn’t have the attention of a first option the other guys do.

LaMelo I don’t think is worth consideration. || He is but there’s like 8 guards that’s are deserving this year which is irritating because the East frontcourt players have been lacking this season. Someone like Jaylen Brown will get an All-Star spot not because he’s played like one but because there isn’t a deep selection of players he’s competing with unlike Herro. || [removed] || When you look at his numbers and the whole butler situation, it feels like he deserves it because now he’s getting the full attention as a number one too. Yet I doubt he finds a spot with the amazing guard play in the east || Herro is playing really well and I would say he is near all star level.  Dame, Young, will be above him.  With the Drama surrounding Butler the coaches will probably take Maxey, Cade, Haliburton or Ball over him as well.  They might also lump Brown in as a guard.

I would put him at near all star and not all star play.  His points are good 24 PPG but not great 25+ or amazing 30+ and his assists are fairly weak at 5.4. He is having a great season and is significantly improved, but he has not been a top 5-6 guard in the East.  Doesn’t mean he isn’t very good though

Edited PPG from typo || I will have to say I was wrong.  I didn’t think Herro would make the.  Congrats to him || My WIGGA Tyler Herro is one of the best pure scorers we’ve ever seen play basketball. His aura is unmatched. || [removed] || [removed] || I'd have him in my wildcard because the east front court is full of undeserving players imo for the wildcards. Especially with how the hawks will be, idk if Trae will make it even though he does deserve it for how insane his playmaking has been.  Main completion is garland, Cade, dame. 


Hali does not deserve it AT ALL no arguments can be made for him imo, his team is playing better because of their defense bye isn't contributing that much too anyways. Ball is hurt, again, and team sucks so those 2 should get him out. I think dame will get in by being dame (not saying my opinion here) so that just leaves maxey and herro and I think herro is more deserving especially since maxey is inefficient || Hero is okay player. No Heat player should be on the All Star team. Heat is sitting at the 7th spot. .500 teams need to focus on winning not sending players to screw off on All Star weekend.
Heat has done Butler wrong! || The Heat also have had the luxury of having Bam and Jimmy (distraction for most of the season)- which is why they have a better record than the Pistons. And the Pistons have beat them twice already.  || Hey. I don’t think his stats are comparable to Damian Lillard. As a second option, Dame is still drawing noticeably more attention than hero (check gravity measurements) and still putting up noticeably higher points per game and assists numbers. Im not really sure your point about them being down by three games and that correlating to herro being better. I do but it’s a very odd point to make.

I strongly disagree. || cade clears. he’s ahead of him in every single stat while having 0 help on his team. this is the same team that was the worse team i. the league and. one of the worst teams ever. and he turned them into a playoff contender. there team records are almost identical so that’s a non factor. cade also draws way more attention than him since his second option is jaden ivey compared to bam adebayo. i also think dame is slightly better but it’s really close and it’s just an opinion thing || Brown is also a proven commodity || Our sub is for in-depth discussion. Low-effort comments or stating opinions as facts are not permitted. Please support your opinions with well-reasoned arguments, including stats and facts as applicable. || Huh? He's averaging 24ppg not 22 and 5.4 assists is great for a natural off guard that shoots a ton. If u watch the games he's being forced to pass early since double teams come as soon as he crosses the half court line. He's also an elite rebounder for his position 

He may or may not be an allstar but it's crazy to say he hasn't played at an all star lvl || Maxey? Lol 

Herro is averaging 24ppg on 62.2% TS. Trae and averaging 55.8% TS and Cade 54.7% TS. Scoring wise, they’re not in the same league. || How does Butler drama have any kind of impact on Herro or coaches decision of choosing him? What a weird argument. || [removed] || We don't allow posts on player rankings or player comparisons on this subreddit. Please read the sticky post for more info. || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || cade dame and garland all deserve those spots over him || Jimmy has missed half the season and even actively sandbagged. He’s added a ton of drama with multiple suspensions, which has led to him being suspended. Clearly not a net positive overall

The Pistons did beat us twice. Interestingly enough in one of the two games Miami lost, Herro went 40/5/8 with 1 turnover on 72% Ts compared to Cade’s 21/7/9 with 7 turnovers on 58% TS - highlighting that even when Herro played better than Cade, thr results may not reflect it. || Jimmy hasnt played this season so calling that a luxury is hilarious, not to mention how putrid Bam has been on offense, teams literally don't guard bam. You should check out some Heat games to get a better look at Herro imo || - Dame 25/5/7 62% TS
- Herro 24/6/5 62% TS

Pretty comparable numbers in my view. Herro is a first option though, so I give him more credit. I wouldn’t say a ppg difference of 1.2ppg is noticeably higher.

I think being a 48 win pace team is quite an underachievement for an All Star playing with a multiple time MVP in their prime, so I don’t give too much credit there. || Bam isn’t a very good offensive player, he’s not much better than Jarrett Allen. Jaden Ivey is a much better 3pt shooter and more reliable shot creator than Bam. || Are we rewarding guys because they’re “proven” or because they deserve it? It’s not like he’s a legend where you can award him with a legacy All-Star nod like Steph, LeBron. And it’s not like he was a top vote getter from the fans. Brown is literally gonna get his nod this year because his competition is weak but he doesn’t deserve it by his play. || You’re right I mistyped points.

5.4 assists is not great.  I am putting him at near all star level which is still great.  It’s not like I am saying he is garbage or stat padding. || Maxey is averaging 27 and 6 assists. Do you think all-star voters pay that much attention to TS over pts/reb/assists when it comes time to slot guys into the game?"
Giannis Antetokounmpo,"""Giannis Antetokounmpo"" OR ""Giannis"" OR ""Greek Freak"" OR ""The Greek Freak"" OR ""Antetokounmpo"" OR ""The Freak""",2025-01-28,nbadiscussion,1icq4x7,How Should We Judge the Shot Diets of the Past? [OC Analysis],"*Hi folks -- apologies for the length, I thought this would end up being shorter than it ended up being. Hope you enjoy!*

As we fully and truly enter the NBA’s efficiency era, one thing that gets tricky to talk about are the efficiency numbers of past NBA greats. The league average True Shooting Percentage (which takes 3-pointers and free throws into account) this season is 57.4%. That’s an unbelievably high mark compared to past years. In 2014-15, the league average TS% was at 53.4%, and in 03-04, the last year before the hand-check rule change, it was down at 51.6%. 

As stated above, this can make talking about past greats tough. Kobe’s career True Shooting is at 55.0%. In the 05-06 season where he averaged 35.4 points and infamously lost a close race with LeBron for the MVP to Steve Nash, his True Shooting was 55.9%, which would put him among the bottom third of NBA teams. MJ’s career TS% was 56.9%. In 1997-98, he won MVP with a TS% of 53.3% – the Wizards’ current TS% of 54.0 is the worst in the league. Kareem was hyper-efficient during his career, with a TS% of 59.2%, but even that doesn’t match Kenny Atkinson’s Cavs and their 61.4% True Shooting this season. In short, it was really, really hard for players who didn’t shoot a lot of threes to match the efficiency of players who do, especially if they relied heavily on midrange shots – that extra point just matters so much. 

(Tangent: to illustrate this, I got curious last week and ran the numbers on LeBron and Kobe’s career points per jump shot. I went onto basketball-reference and multiplied their career FGAs by % of shots taken from 10-15 feet and 16-23 feet to get the data on their midrange jumpers – since they work in percentages, there were decimal points where there shouldn’t have been and the results may therefore be off by a percentage point or two. 

Still, here’s the breakdown. Kobe took 4,506 shots \[again, give or take one or two\] from 10-15 feet, and made 41.1% of them. He took 7,100 shots from 16-23 feet, and made 40.2% of them. He shot 1827-5546 from three-point range. That’s 14,894 points on 17,153 shots, or .874 points per shot – that comes out to an eFG% of 43.42%. 

LeBron, as of January 21st, 2025, had taken 2,875 shots from 10-15 feet and made 36.8% of them. He took 5,451 shots from 16-23 feet, making 38.6% of them. He had shot 2,492-7,130 from 3-point range. That’s 13,800 points on 15,457 shots, which comes out to .892 points per shot, an eFG% of 44.6%. 

So Kobe, a virtuosic midrange shooter capable of hitting shot after shot over every coverage imaginable, loses out efficiency-wise to LeBron because LeBron, despite having an iffy midrange shot for a lot of his career, took a considerably higher rate of 3s and made them at a slightly higher clip. “Objectively,” I have very little doubt in my mind that Kobe was a better shooter than LeBron – heck, you can see that at the free throw line – but the power of that extra point is undeniable. 

Also, even though LeBron’s shot diet was more “modern” than Kobe’s, all those years taking so many mid-range shots still drags him down compared to the current jump shot diet – if you shoot 29.73% from 3-point range and don’t take any from the midrange, you’re clearing LeBron’s career efficiency on shots outside of 10 feet.) 

Sorry, that was a long tangent. I kinda feel like “LeBron has been more efficient on shots outside of 10 feet than Kobe” was too inflammatory to live on its own, so I hid it in here. Anyways, I want to get to the bottom of my feelings about viewing historic greats through a modern efficiency lens through three takes – a good one, a “maybe” one, and an iffy one. To start, let’s talk about Tetris. 

**Part 1: Larry Bird and Tetris Innovation**

The first take we’ll look at is one I think is fair – Larry Bird, despite having 3-point numbers that pale in comparison to those of modern players, should be considered a great 3-point shooter, and it’s totally fair to assume he would have made threes at a much higher volume if he’d played in a later era. 

I’m [running a bit counter to JJ Redick here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK_Bq-gxQQU), even though I loved JJ Redick as a member of the media and don’t think he was “wrong,” per se, when he called out Bird’s standing as a potential top-5 three-point shooter. Yes, Larry Bird only made 649 career threes – Steph Curry made 402 in the 15-16 season alone. Yes, he shot 71-276 (25.7%) from deep between 1980 and 1984. He’s 184th all-time in three-point percentage, and not close to the top 250 for 3-pointers made. And yes, [he wasn’t working quite as hard to get his looks from 3-point range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eee2TkiclIM) as players do today. However, context matters, and this is where Tetris comes into play. 

For years and years, Jonas Neubauer stood as Tetris’ undisputed GOAT. He won the Classic Tetris World Championship 7 times between 2010 and 2017, and was runner-up in 2014 and 2018. He claimed to be the first player ever to achieve a “max-out” score of 999,999 (there is some controversy surrounding this), and in 2018 set the record with a high score of 1,245,200. 

However, despite his obvious mastery of a game that came out in 1989, there was something very important Jonas didn’t know about Tetris. So far as Jonas or anyone else knew, it was only possible to go so far in a game of Tetris before the “kill screen” – the pieces would move so fast it was physically impossible to maneuver them, and the game would end shortly after a player reached level 29 and the speed of the pieces doubled. 

As it turns out, however, it wasn’t impossible – it was just impossible for Jonas. He, like everyone else, believed the fastest way to move a piece was to hold the button down. When you do that, the built-in lag is too strong for anyone to play at the speeds required for level 29. In 2018, it became widely known that you can “hypertap” the controller to get around that lag and play past level 29, and in 2020 players figured out a way to roll the controller in their hands to achieve ludicrous speeds previously thought literally impossible. 

When players figured that out, Jonas’ records got absolutely demolished. Players were able to reach levels in the hundreds, one (“Blue Scuti”) got to level 157 and made the game crash, and, in October of 2024, a player (“dogplayingtetris”) on a crash-resistant version of the game got past level 255 and reached “rebirth,” when the game starts itself over again. The current Tetris high-score record stands at 16,700,760 points. ([The modern history of Tetris is fascinating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOJlg8g8_yw).) 

Here’s the point: I don’t take anything away from Jonas for not knowing about hypertapping. When players who have gotten scores beyond anything Jonas could have dreamed of face each other at the CWTC now, they play for the Jonas Neubauer trophy, and that’s how it should be. And just like we shouldn’t hold Jonas responsible for playing before anyone knew the power of hypertapping, we shouldn’t hold Larry Bird responsible for playing before anyone truly knew the power of the three-point shot. (Yes, “maybe we should take the jump shot that counts for 50% more points” is perhaps a shorter intuitive leap than “let’s see what happens if I mash the absolute crap out of a button on a controller that hasn’t been widely used for two decades,” but that’s besides the point.) 

When Larry Bird played, he used the three-point line as much as anyone thought it was possible to. It was introduced to the NBA in Bird’s rookie year, and averaging approximately one made three per game functioned as the NBA’s version of level 29 – go any further than that, and an efficiency “kill screen” was thought to be inevitable. Larry led the league in 3s made twice and shot better than 40% from deep six times. When they held the first-ever three-point contest, Larry won it by getting 73.33% of the possible points – when Curry won the contest in 2021, he got 70% of the possible points. After that, Bird won the next two contests. 

Relative league stats also help show just how far ahead of his time Bird was – his career 3P+ (his field goal percentage relative to the league, with 100 being average) was 127, higher than Curry’s career mark of 119. His 3Pr+, his rate of threes relative to the league, was a mind-bending 227. (Again, for comparison, Curry’s is at “only” 165.) That’s not to say Bird was a better shooter than Curry – league-relative stats aren’t a magic bullet, and they can underrate current players, who are playing extremely close to the efficiency “ceiling.” It used to be possible to ""hack"" your way to great relative efficiency by cutting midrange shots out -- [I wrote about it when Kevin Martin did it all the way back in 2009.](https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/6923/kevin-martin-the-adam-dunn-of-the-nba) Now that everyone has a much better shot diet, those edges are a lot harder to find. However, Bird was a shooting Bonjwa, he deserves his flowers as one of the best of all time, and it’s totally fair to imagine he would have drained a lot more threes in a later era. Now let’s get a bit trickier. 

**Part 2: Kevin Garnett and the Ship of Theseus** 

The second take (“thesis statement,” if you prefer to be fancy) we’ll examine is “Kevin Garnett would have been a ton better in the modern era,” which I actually have mixed feelings about. 

I’ve said before that Kevin Garnett was tragically ahead of his time, and it would have been amazing to see what he would have done now, when big men have so much more freedom to make plays and shoot from distance. Despite a great stroke, Garnett spotted up from 20 feet away, because that’s where even “stretchy” four-men were supposed to stand. Despite all his skill with the ball, he spent much of his prime toiling away in the efficiency desert of the mid-post. In his MVP season, where he was doing most of his work from that area, his True Shooting was 54.7% – only the Pelicans, Hornets, Magic, and Wizards are posting a worse mark than than this season. In the 07-08 season, a full 57% of his shots were from midrange, and 36.5% were from 16-23 feet. Even though he knocked those shots down at a spectacular rate, hitting 48.8% from 10-15 feet and 48.2% from 16-23 feet, those shots would have been better-taken if he had been willing/allowed/expected to step behind the line and hit just a third of them. 

It’s easy to say that the guy who took the entire 2000 Olympic team in one-on-ones should have been allowed to show the full volume of his skill in a more spread-out offense, and it probably would have looked a lot better on the stat sheet. But would that have actually made Garnett a better player, or more fun to watch. Yes, those mid-post possessions were inefficient compared to what modern offenses do, but everyone was doing it at the time, and KG was really, really good at it. Those long twos helped his team win a championship. (The Celtics and Lakers meeting in the finals on the backs of midrange masters with the Seven Seconds or Less Suns and the Beautiful Game Spurs laying the foundation for what the league would become was a real “John Henry beats the Steam Shovel” moment in NBA history.)

I think sometimes about if Kevin Durant would have been more effective in an old “meta” where the mid-range was king. He certainly doesn’t have trouble scoring efficiently in the spaced-out NBA, but his accuracy from midrange and ability to get a midrange shot from his spot whenever he wants it is almost unmatched in league history. It’s easy to say everyone taking midrange shots instead of 3s was running a marathon with a lead backpack on from an efficiency standpoint, but what does it do to the guys who are great at adjusting to the weight of that backpack? 

Also, the Ship of Theseus comes into play here. If Kevin Garnett had come up in modern times, his long twos would have been threes – that’s easy enough to imagine. And he would have gotten a lot more easy dunks in pick-and-roll. Also, he would have come up in a post-Durant era, and had a lot more freedom to handle the ball, and would have done more work facing up instead of in the mid-post…and at some point, *he wouldn’t have been Kevin Garnett.* The Kevin Garnett we got may not have been the most “optimized” version of him, but he played in the style of his time while pushing the envelope in terms of what big men could do as far as he could push it. Should that be enough? I’m not sure, which is why I have more mixed feelings about this take than something like “it’s very easy to imagine Larry Bird making a lot of threes in the modern era.”

**Part 3: Michael Jordan and Occam’s Razor**

After a thesis I find very reasonable and one I have mixed feelings about, let’s move onto one that I see a lot and think is pretty silly – “Michael Jordan would have been a great three-point shooter if he played today, he just played in a time when players didn’t take those so he didn’t care about it.” 

So here’s what we know. Michael Jordan was an amazing basketball player and historically great midrange shooter. I actually think MJ was the greatest player of all time, which I suppose makes me somewhat of a heretic as someone who is also a card-carrying LeBron homer, but I also feel uncomfortable amongst the MJ fanbase because I prefer to talk about the actual Michael Jordan instead of the imaginary one. (Here’s a tangent: MJ’s DPOY season was *ludicrous.* He averaged a league-leading 3.2 steals per game and had 1.6 blocks per game as a shooting guard. LeBron’s career-high for blocks per game is 1.1. *He had more steals than turnovers that season.* Who did he beat for the award? The #2 vote-getter was Mark Eaton, who led the league in blocks. The #3 vote-getter was Hakeem, whom the DPOY trophy is named after now. And he deserved it! He was tied with Hakeem in “stocks,” the Bulls had a better defensive rating than the Rockets, and Jordan was essentially tied with Hakeem in DWS and destroyed him in DBPM. Michael Jordan was incredible.)

However, MJ was not great at shooting 3s. He shot 32.7% from 3 over his career, and he really benefited from the shorter 3-point line – if you take those seasons out, he was a 28.8 shooter from deep. Even taking the league into account, he wasn’t great – his career 3p+ was a below-average 95, and his 3PAr+ was just 71, which is especially low considering guards were taking nearly all of the threes back in those times. He actually participated in a three-point contest once, and posted [the worst score in NBA history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr-NKGIg5BQ).

This is where you’ll run into a viral clip of [MJ saying in an interview that actually, he didn’t want to be great at threes](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vigL3Z9mt1Y), because he would fall too much in love with it and it would take away from the strength of his game, which is attacking the basket. 

Let’s drill down on that one a bit, because it gets cited a lot. First off, MJ loved the shorter line. In his two full seasons with it, he shot 260 and 297 threes, which were both career-high marks – when they moved the line back the next season, he only shot 126. So a shot from 23 feet and 9 inches takes away from attacking the basket, but one from 22 feet doesn’t? 

Also, the post-baseball version of MJ, which is the only version we have tracking data on, actually wasn’t a particularly aggressive basket attacker – in 96-97, 18% of his shots were from within 3 feet, and in 97-98 22.1% of his shots came at the rim. The league, as a whole, took 34.1% of its shots from 0-3 feet in 96-97, and 28.6% of the league’s shots were at the rim in 97-98. Sure, a lot of the looks he got from midrange were set up with the threat of the drive, but that doesn’t seem like enough driving to justify voluntarily giving up a three-point shot, and a lot of his shots came from post-ups in that era. (It should be noted that this is post-baseball MJ, and it looks like that interview clip was from the earlier years.) Also, he wouldn’t at least have tried to extend his range in the Wizards years, when he took less than 14% of his shots at the rim? 

It’s worth mentioning we’re talking about Michael Jordan here. He became a near-professional level golfer because he was mad his college roommate Davis Love III could hit the ball further than him. He would get furious when Christian Laettner beat him at ping-pong on the Dream Team. In 1988, Jordan averaged 35 points per game, won MVP, and also got the aforementioned DPOY award. He threw quarters close to a wall. In 1989, he came to Tim Grover to overhaul his body and training. That’s the guy who said “The three-point shot? The thing I do once per game? The thing I shot 1,778 times in my career? Nah, that’s not worth being good at, I won’t waste my time practicing that.” 

At some point, Occam’s Razor comes into play and I have an easier time believing “the guy who took nearly 2,000 threes and hit a low percentage of them wasn’t very good at them, and may have had enough of an ego to create a self-serving explanation for that weakness in an interview” than “MJ didn’t feel like becoming good threes.” 

This is the part where we mention that MJ focusing on midrange shooting worked very, very well. The Bulls won 69 games in 96-97, 62 games in 97-98, and won the championship both years. It was remarked upon by the media at the time and continues to be mentioned. MJ had a flat stroke that was perfect for mid-range shots, especially with the way he could control it in off-balance situations and over tough coverages, and it allowed him to absolutely dominate a league with a heavy emphasis on mid-range shooting. You can only play in your era, and MJ was perfect for his. That doesn’t roll off the tongue as smoothly as “MJ is the best and he would have no problem being the best in a different way,” but it feels closer to the truth. 

If he had come along today, he probably would have developed a shot with more arc that would have given him more range, but then he wouldn’t have been the Michael Jordan that we got, who was the best NBA player of all time. Also, there are no guarantees on anything – Giannis, Zion Williamson, and other guys were still able to exist in this era, after all. In 20 years, are we going to say “well, if Giannis had been in today’s game, he obviously would have been a great three-point shooter?” Again, the big point is that the actual Michael Jordan should be good enough to appreciate without having to make up a fantasy superhero Michael Jordan that’s good at something the real one never showed any real signs of being great at. 

Alright, it’s well past time to wrap this whole thing up. Modern efficiency has made it very hard to compare players across eras, at least on paper. Almost every great player from the past would likely play the game at least a little bit, if not very, differently, in today’s environment. Sometimes the adjustments we make to past performance, like that the best shooter of his generation would have done well if asked to shoot more, are extremely reasonable. Others are less so, and we don’t want to lose sight of what made players great against the opponents actually faced when trying to fit them into a theoretical modern NBA and compare them with players who are playing a different game.  ",61,36,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1icq4x7/how_should_we_judge_the_shot_diets_of_the_past_oc/,2025-01-29 04:35:25,"This is tremendous content for this sub so thank you for putting this together. I generally agree with you regarding how we should value past achievements in their historical context, but I suspected you would find resistance, and it appears you did. IMO once you start imagining more nuanced and hypothetical situations such as how a player might do in another era, you leave the realm of objective verifiable discourse. Everyone is going to think their take on the matter is the right one, because people don’t like to think their logic isn’t sound, and there isn’t enough data to definitively say one way or another. So while I agree that MJ was pathologically competitive at everything and of course he wanted to be good at 3s, someone else is going to say there’s no reason to think MJ couldn’t have fixed his arc with a modern shot doctor while still remaining lethal from midrange. And they’re going to be just as correct. Still, it’s fun to conjecture, which is good for this sub. 

A few nitpicks- there was an article going around in the last year or two outlining the insane degree of home cooking MJ was receiving on defense in those early years, and a brief look at his home and road splits would support that. In 88 he averaged a mind boggling 4 spg and 2bpg at home against a still solid but nowhere near as impressive 2 and 1 on the road.

Also, I’m not convinced Kobe was a better shooter than LeBron.  He probably was. His style of fadeaway triple teamed daggers to break his opponent’s will probably didn’t help his percentages. But his form was a bit old school, and his last four healthy years he was approaching Westbrook level inefficiency from deep. LeBron has never been a particularly good shooter, but he’s spent the second half of his career being an average one. You can point to their FT%, but occasionally that doesn’t tell the whole story.

I hope you keep posting here. Good stuff || There are definitely fans who value efficiency that did not see Kobe play in his heyday, and are underwhelmed by his stats looking back. But his shot selection (especially relative to the option of feeding Shaq more) was questioned his entire career by media, fans, his own coaches and teammates that didn't have any idea what true shooting percentage was. So I don't think it's suddenly unfair to question it now just because we have different and better tools for looking at it. Some of those tools even reflect favorably upon him, when you examine how he elevated the team offense including in the playoffs and the way he scaled with other good players.

It is interesting to think that from 1979 to 2015, cross era statistical comparisons really only had to adjust for pace. League average offensive rating and true shooting percentage were basically stable that that entire time. I think with some different rules enforcement that could have even maintained through the three point shooting surge. I think it's still the fairest way to do it if you had to, but I don't like that we now have to use layers of abstraction like adjusting true shooting percentage for what the league average was at the time. || I'll admit i didn't make it all the way through your post but I'm not sure why you'd compare Kobes true shooting to modern teams rather than to the same season?  He was 51st in TS% that season so still not terribly efficient.  Great shooter or not i think Kobe gets a knock for his poor shot selection, something that became really pronounced in his later years.  He was notorious for waving off open teammates and shooting his shot good or bad, sort of the anti LeBron in that sense.  So he might have a better stroke than LeBron but did it matter? || The shot profile of today's game has been echoed throughout history, it's just difficult to replicate as players with less talent or mismanaged teams (sorry Cade) try to carry the load without the support needed.

Whenever this topic gets brought up, I always like to bring up two players - Reggie Miller and Manu Ginobili. Reggie Miller was the prototype for Steph Curry, and Manu Ginobili for Harden. (Fun fact; Reggie's lowest TS% was at around 58%!!!, it was in his rookie year and last year in the league; while Manu's peaked at 61 in 2007-08). I would argue, that these two were outliers in their respective generations, which supports your thesis.  
  
I do think today's spacing will inflate some of the modern era's numbers (and that's not a bad thing). Although not really what you're trying to do, but when comparing against eras, I propose to just start with how much better was Player X compared to the average player in his era? vs other similar performers in his era? That should normalise some noise, but its not perfect. || BTW, I believe this is the point I'm allowed to plug my Substack -- you can find this post and others like it at [(5) Krolik's Corner | John Krolik | Substack](https://johnkrolik.substack.com/?r=yw64&utm_campaign=subscribe-page-share-screen&utm_medium=web) if you're so inclined. Take a look around, maybe even subscribe if you're feeling feisty, it's free! || This is a bit of a tangent, but I don't know where else to post it. I find Larry Bird's three point shooting evolution over his career fascinating.

As a rookie, he attempted 1.7 threes per game and made .406. This is outstanding.

But then for his next four seasons, he inexplicably reduced his three point volume to less than one attempt per game, and only made around 25%.

And then in his sixth season he started shooting more threes again (1.6 per game) and made .427. For the rest of his career, he increased his volume even more and mostly stayed over 40%. 

So, what happened in years 2-5? I can think of a couple of possibilities:

1. His rookie season was fool's gold. Maybe he just had great shooting luck in in his rookie year, and his actual expected three point percentage was in the 20s. Then he reverted back to expectations in seasons 2-5. Finally, in season 6 he improved his three point shooting to an elite level (for the time period, at least).

2. He really was an elite three point shooter right from the start. But in seasons 2-5, for some reason his coach told him to stop shooting threes. So he stopped shooting threes in the normal flow of the game. However, since he was the star player, he was responsible for taking most of his team's heaves, ""grenades,"" end-of-shot-clock attempts, and desperation end-of-game shots. With such a low volume of attempts, his three point shot diet was dominated by these low-quality shots. This actually seems more plausible to me than the first hypothesis. Under this scenario, we can speculate about how Bird would have performed with increased three-point volume. Typically we assume that a player's efficiency will be reduced with increased volume, as the player's additional shots are lower-quality than their current average. But in Bird's case, he had such a low volume that the low quality shots discussed above may have actually significantly harmed his efficiency even in his more prolific shooting years (he maxed out at 3.3 attempts per game). So it is plausible that with increased volume, his three point percentage would have actually increased. || Fun fact about Larry Bird: He had more games where he didn’t make any three pointers than games where he made any

I’d agree for sure that he was amazing in his era and that if he was born forty years later he would’ve done things differently and probably made many more, but that’s to me akin to saying “if my aunt had wheels she’d be a bicycle”. He had the same three point line in the 80s, had arguably easier shooting conditions, knew you could take threes at volume (he had 10 attempts multiple times), and still made 649 at 38%. For his time, this is excellent, now it’s not. 

Your Tetris comparison doesn’t hold water here in my opinion, there was no new discovery. Nobody found out that standing in a certain spot your 3P% doubled or something, it’s the same shot that has always existed. Celebrate the players in their era but you can’t really make cross era comparisons, this has been JJ’s point as well || [removed] || Reggie's a guy who modern stats definitely look favorably upon, and there were guys like Kevin Martin who were unappreciated shot-diet pioneers -- the question of ""how much should we penalize guys for accepting conventional wisdom when they had peers who didn't"" is one I don't have a definitive answer for. (TS+ and other stats like it, which I mentioned in the Bird part, do provide a lot of help, but are far from perfect.) || I've been thinking a lot about the Ship of Theseus recently in an entirely different context - the AD trade.

Essentially I'm not sure how Mavs fans could have any attachment to this team when none of their key players have been there more than two years.

Anyway, great post. || Yeah I didn’t have much time to drill down on it, this post was more than long enough as is, but I also found that fascinating. His rookie year was also the 3pt line’s first year in the NBA. || Bird shot more 3PTA (3.1) in his 1988 season than Dirk Nowitzki shot (2.2) during his 2007 MVP season. And he shot it at 41% that season, basically the same rate as Dirk Nowitzki shot in 2007.

Both he and Nowitzki have the same career shooting percentages from 3PT at 38% but for whatever reason I never have to hear that obsessional nitpicking that Dirk didn't shoot enough from three for his era or questions about whether he could play today. || Well that's the gist of parts 2 and 3, so I'm picking up what you're putting down. Maybe I was a bit too timid about not going after players for not taking more agency in their shot selection, but ""the three is a gimmick and it's impossible to make them at high volume"" was heavily entrenched dogma in Bird's time. But your point is well taken, it's not like he (or KG or MJ, for that matter) was gonna get benched if he'd taken five a game. || Not u stealing that bicycle joke, have some shame lmao || The value of the 3 actually is kind of a new discovery, the result of analytics that didn't exist in the era of Bird. We all knew 3 points is more than 2. But people didn't grasp how to leverage that, much like people didn't understand that Tetris trick.

For decades, there was the phrase ""Live by the 3, die by the 3."" It was widely believed that winning basketball and high volume 3 pointers were incompatible because of wide variance in performance. You may get hot and win a game. But you may go cold and lose it. So if you want to win, are you taking the sure thing, or that risky 3? 

Even past the era of Bird, some of the most famous 3 point shooting games have not been the positive type. John Starks going 0-11 from 3 in game 7 is seared into the heads of Knicks fans. That sort of unpredictability is exactly why teams and players shied away from it. || [removed] || Free throws are a big part of it, sure, but to be clear Kobe's eFG% was higher than league average on an extremely tough shot diet for the majority of his prime. Even in his 35 PPG season he was at league average eFG%. || Nah, Kobe was a great finisher relative to era. %’s around the rim have increased dramatically in recent years. || So I came up writing for LA publications and am naturally a Kobe skeptic -- I learned early on that a spoonful (or truckful) of sugar is pretty necessary for the medicine to go down when it comes to talking about Kobe (or MJ, for that matter.) || I’m sure Bird could play today, the greats all could. My quibble is more with considering him an alltime great shooter. I wouldn’t say Dirk is either || The analytics of 3X0.376 > 2X0.509 (in the case of Bird) was there the whole time, it’s pretty simple math. It’s different than the Tetris trick described because people literally didn’t know that existed. Not doing simple math is not the same thing

I think the phrase you mentioned still persists today, as 3pt shooting does have a lot of variance. Think about the Rockets finishing their game shooting 0/27 against the Warriors in game 7. I don’t think winning basketball was ever at odds with shooting 3s, it was just known to be a riskier play || Please do not attack the person, their post history, or their age as a proxy for disagreeing with their opinions. || Mid 30s, I never watched Bird play. I’m well aware that the game was played differently in the 80s, but the rules weren’t significantly different in any way. Should I give Bird credit for falling in line with the status quo? || Back then, we could count to three and even do percentages. 

Although the league can be slow in adapting changes, I don’t think this was it. A 3p specialist, like Tracy Murray, could get up to 40% some seasons. It wasn’t viable because it was unreliable and teams would defend it more in the playoffs. 
«Jump shooting teams» had never won any rings for a reason, not some arbitrary conventional wisdom. || IDK about ""great,"" career 63.7% finisher when the average during the time he played was 61.4%. Certainly respectable though, especially for a guard/wing. || He still has some of the highest scoring rounds in the 3PT contest I believe, if that means anything. || But the Tetris trick was always there, the same as the numbers for 3's. It's the same situation where people didn't see a solution that was there the whole time. I mean, people didn't realize you could hit a button twice to increase efficiency for 30 years? That seems just as glaring as the 3's. Especially with the headwinds against the 3 based off from conventional wisdom. That's why I would say that comparison holds up.

That Rockets game is different in terms of context and the common discourse around the 3. That game was after Curry and the Warriors showed you could win a title by the 3. As well as the previous year of beautiful basketball by the Spurs. And your last point about it being a riskier play is exactly why the best teams would be hesitant to rely on it. If you can win consistently, why introduce variables that could hurt as much as help? Especially when there were more glaring instances of it hurting you?

And I forgot to address your point about Bird's 3P% being less than optimal today: even if we ignore Bird practicing the 3 more, there is another factor at play when accounting for those numbers. With the 3 revolution, teams specifically design plays to get open 3's. If Bird's coaches weren't actively scheming to get him open 3's, his numbers will look different than a modern player who benefits from that. || He was consistently well above league average for his position, for the vast majority of his career. +2.3 rEfficiency for a guy who was also above average from 3-23 feet is excellent. || I think Bird is an all-timer in terms of shooting. But I really don't think the small sample size controlled conditions of a 3 point contest are the points of proof we should look to. I think the eye test, looking at Bird's shooting form, things along those lines are the angles we should pursue for Bird. || He’s tied for 9th, tied for 31st, and tied for 35th in terms of percentage among out of 38 winners alltime.

Everybody has been losing their minds over the return for Luka. I'm a laker fan and I won't pretend we didn't get a steal of a deal. We obviously did. This thread is not about how unfair the deal was, as no deal that sends Luka out will be balanced. 

All the feelings and outrage are valid. However, I find some of the loudest objections to be vague and speculative. Everyone seems to believe that there was a better deal with the Mavs goals in mind. I'm willing to be convinced. That's what I'd like to explore. 

This thread is not about how stupid it is to pass on extending Luka. This thread is not for guessing at conspiracy theories. This is not about more undeserved slander at AD, a legit top 10 force who has been talked about like he's a dying Hassan whiteside about to go bad in the fridge (btw he is going to be incredible next to Kyrie and Lively/gafford). Check any of the other threads for a healthy dose of that.

Nico Harrison and the Mavs have talked about wanting to win now and make a dominant pairing for the next 3-4 years. They said that they chose the deal they wanted and operated in silence to avoid a circus. Most don't agree with this, many don't buy that spin, and this has obviously been a fiasco. However, at least it hasn't been drawn out like with Jimmy and the Heat, or Jimmy and the wolves, or Dame and the Blazers, or AD and the pelicans, or Kawhi with the Spurs. We could go on and on. Those teams really couldn't max their value or get the deal they wanted, and the player had plenty of control, which is far from desirable when your priority is to Win Now and not to rebuild yet. That's a valid concern. As upset as Mavs fans rightfully are right now, their team is still ready to win now and that's hard to keep hating for long.

So let's follow the premise: You are Nico and the Mavs. You want to keep this quick and clean. You want to pick the deal you want and just make it happen. You don't want a public auction because you don't want to let anyone influence the end result, which you have seen go wrong several times in recent years. You want to win now with Kyrie and the rest of the squad you've got. You're super done with Luka and ownership is with you.

You can basically take your pick, but they have to be available in that deal. Joker, Shai, and Wemby are not going to be available, and likely not giannis either. The Cavs, Celtics, Thunder, and Knicks probably don't want to rock the boat. The Grizz may consider swapping Ja for Luka, but otherwise they'd be too redundant having them both if the mavs get JJJ instead. I don't think they would do it. I doubt the wolves move Ant for Luka though it's not impossible to imagine, just unlikely. I doubt the Mavs value Booker over AD. Outside of that, I struggle to find a Win Now deal better than a package around AD. Maybe the package could've been squeezed for a few more drops, but then you risk losing control of the situation and having a dragged out circus. So...

Who exactly do you want that's actually going to be available to you? Who fits with this squad? Based on who you perceive as relatively available, who are you asking for?

OR

You are the GM of your favorite team. You heard that there's a silent auction for Luka. You leak => No Luka for you. The Mavs only want Win Now offers. What's your best offer?




EDIT: Welp, this was fun. A lot of you wanted to debate about whether or not Nico properly squeezed the Lakers, so to all of you, let me say one final time, I agree that Nico did a shit job and, even given these circumstances, should have done better than he did with the Lakers. 

I agree with many of you that an open auction could have, at the least, gotten the Mavs Knecht, Reaves, and more picks. Totally true. It's also clear that Nico and ownership accepted that the cost of a silent process was not optimizing the margins of the package. Agree or disagree all you want, but considering how he is being talked about right now, if you are Nico and committed to moving on from Luka, silence is probably the safest choice, in which backlash comes in one haymaker instead of a drawn out war. Instead, he got to choose his guy, and that's what he did. In other comparable Big Star trades, the team trading the star out rarely gets who they wanted. That's big. 

As far as other offers go, I'm not going to do the due diligence of looking up who has what number of picks, but here's a list of packages that you guys suggested that I felt might be worth the Mavs interest. I did not include many Max Christie types, as our conversations were largely about the core level of the package

OKC Chet + JDub 
BOS Jaylen Brown, Derek White, Jrue Holiday
MIN Ant
HOU Amen + Jabari + Alpie + Jalen
CLE Mobley + Garland 
MIA Bam + Herro
MEM JJJ + Bane
ORL Paolo + Franz + Suggs + WCJ
PHI Maxey + PG + McCain
CHA Miller

Of these, I think that only some are plausible. I don't think OKC, BOS, HOU, MEM, CLE or NYK want to shake up their success by bringing in a player who is going to change their entire offensive identity and defensive vulnerability. I think MIN is resistant to letting go of Ant for Luka, as they are probably more confident in Ant staying than Luka. 
That leaves ORL, CHA, and PHI. And if I'm the Mavs trying to win now, those are the most risky for winning now. If I choose anything other than the Lakers package, it's probably ORL. But even then, I think the AD package would be better. 

Thanks for participating, everyone!",35,157,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1ih58jy/your_best_win_now_offer_for_luka_doncic/,2025-02-03 19:50:32,"I find the logic of wanting to win now and trading Luka to be slightly incongruent, he just helped them get to the finals, - Davis doesn’t make them more of a contender than they were before and so it doesn’t really make sense from that front and therefore if you’re trading away Luka your priority should be maximizing returns.    

JJJ and Bane would be an intriguing framework for a deal, Bam and Herro is another one, Chet and Williams and picks is another I’d consider.   

Even if you were set on Davis that package was not the best you could do at minimum you should be adding Reaves and potentially Knecht and the other pick || I don't think the issue is AD. He is a great piece in a Luka trade. I dont think there is a better player that is available.

I think the issue is that they didn't get anything else.
I would have expected all the 1st, all the seconds, all the swaps that the Lakers can do. 

I would also expect a Dalton or Reaves or both. 

Even if Luka and AD were identical players, AD being 6 years older, is worth more than one 1st. || I think the problem is with the starting premise. That it has to be a win now move, and that it has to be kept secret. Why?

I think from the reporting its clear Niko Harrison wanted AD and no one else and that was the entire premises. That he valued AD higher, likely than anyone on earth. That's the only explanation of how you let Rob Pelinka finesse you out of Dalton Knecht and the 2031 pick at the last minute and don't call a single other team or tell him to get lost. Somehow the Lakers seemed to have the leverage here.

Rob Pelinka is trying to play hard ball about the 2031 pick and Dalton Knecht and you don't even make a call about Chet? Palo? Mobley? JJJ? Amen Thompson? Hell, call the Bucks up about Giannis lol. This entire process was malpractice. || I think honestly as the Mavs I'd still likely get AD, but also include Reaves, to either play SG or as a 6moy type player. I think the mavs are constructed well but definitely lacking a 2nd off the dribble creator. Or even potentially get a 4th team involved to get the lakers to deal Reaves and or knecht plus a pick to aquire another win now player.

On the other hand, as a wolves fan, I don't think we trade ANT. We probably offer something absolutely terrible around randle and the few picks we have, but hey with nico on the line who knows. || I think the Celtics could have logically offered Brown and Prichard and a couple of firsts and it feels as good as the deal at the very least. Throw in Holiday and I’m still fine with it. || The only teams that make sense to trade for Luka without any way for the receiving GM to get assurances that Luka would be interested in re-signing would be the Lakers, Clippers, Heat, and maybe the Knicks.  Without the supermax on the table, Luka gets equal money signing with any team in 2026, and should only ask for a 2+1 deal to maximize his earnings.  That depresses his value compared to trading him after he's signed a supermax extension and is under contract for 5 years. Maybe a team like Memphis or OKC that traded for him could get a return in a S&T if he doesn't want to re-sign, but maybe the Lakers just clear cap space and sign him outright in 2026.  Is it worth Jalen Williams and 5 FRP if the Thunder only get 1+ seasons of Luka and have to hope he wants to stay?  It's not an easy question to answer.

Within those limitations, Anthony Davis is the best player the Mavs could acquire for Luka.  He's better than Kawhi or Harden, better than Jimmy Butler, better than KAT or Brunson.  I think a lot of the outrage comes from the fact that the Lakers emptied out the asset chest for Davis; two #2 picks on rookie deals, the #4 pick, a solid starter on a cheap contract, and 3 additional first round picks.  In comparison, AD, Max Christie and a single FRP seems inadequate, when the Mavs could have gotten Knecht and a second FRP without anybody saying ""wow, the Mavs won this deal."" || The problem is we don't know if Luka would be willing to re-sign in most cities. I think that rules out OKC, CLE, DET, MEM, ORL, etc. since they wouldn't want to take that risk.

Given that I think AD is probably the best individual player they could have come away with. || AD is one of the better win now moves for sure. But there were better opportunities to be comparably win now without sacrificing their entire future. Which this trade did, given there future draft picks. But I’ll take a crack at all the realistic (maybe semi realistic) offers that I think would have still allowed the Mavs to remain contenders while also having a future.

Obvious answer: trading for AD but also getting Knecht and a pick (if not Reaves as well)

But moving on:

- Celtics: Jaylen Brown + 3-4 firsts - I think Celtics would go for this, but Mavs get a 2 way star and future assets (slightly less win now than they were with Luka)
- Heat: Bam Adebayo + Tyler Herro - Mavs get a top tier defensive center and an offensive weapon (imo would be a better team than current)
- Magic: Paulo/Franz + Suggs + 2 firsts - Get a young rising star, a young two way defensive star, and future assets (slightly less win now)
- 76ers: Embiid + Mccain + 1 first or Maxey + 3 firsts - Embiid is still a MvP caliber player when healthy, imo better than AD, obviously major health concerns but what result in a serious discount where Mavs could get Mccain and a future draft asset. Also could be a Maxey move plus future assets
- Thunder: Chet + 4 firsts - I think Thunder at the very least consider this, Mavs would be less win now than with AD but would be win now for a significantly longer period
- Grizzlies: JJJ + Bane - Young two star in JJJ, and Bane is a borderline all star caliber player. Would improve their lineup for years to come 
- Nuggets: Jamal Murray + MPJ + 4-5 firsts (add Christian Braun also if needed) - I think the Nuggets if they knew Luka was available would have made everything except Jokic available and sent whatever was possibly needed to get it done
- Wolves: Ant + Gobert (maybe needs an additional item from Dallas) - Young superstar and an elite defensive center, I think Wolves would swap Ant for Luka not sure about alongside Gobert
- Suns: Dbook + 3-4 firsts or KD + 4 firsts - Both of these moves would have made Mavs comparably a good enough contender as they were with Luka but also adds assets
- Pelicans: Zion + Herbert Jones + 2 firsts - Obviously this would never go considering conditioning issues are obviously very important to Mavs, but get an elite player out of Zion and a top tier perimeter defender in Herbert Jones plus picks
- Jazz: Markannen + Kessler + 4-5 firsts - 2 young players with enormous potential, and I believe Ainge would have sent a boatload of picks as well

Overall, I think that Heat package would be the winner if we’re talking purely win now as in this season/next season. But if I were a normal GM (as in someone who actually cares about further than 3 years in the future), I’d take all these trades over the current iteration with AD || I guess my issue is I don’t see this as a win now team.  To me they shortened their window.  Kyrie and AD isn’t a pairing I believe in to win a championship.  Selling off a top 5 player and not getting a haul of assets, and instead getting an older player with a history of missing games and seemingly nearing the end of their prime in an attempt to “win now” is the strange part of the trade.  With that being said, if that’s their goal there might not be a better available trade. || I mean this post is just wrong. The biggest problem is that AD necessarily isn't bad, but trading him straight-up for Luka (which is what happened essentially) is a horrible return. I doubt Mavs fans would've been as mad if they got AD + both firsts, 2 swaps, Reaves, Christie, and Knecht for Luka, Kleber, Morris, and a 2nd rounder.

Neither am I completely sold on the fit. Nico Harrison did such a good job of building a team to fit to Luka's strengths/weaknesses, I have no idea why he would dump the centerpiece of the contender he made. Kyrie has always operated best as an off-ball, iso player. He excelled next to Lebron, Luka, and KD/Harden, but struggled when he had to take on the primary facilitator role (Cleveland pre-Lebron, Boston, and Brooklyn when KD was injured/before Harden got there). Gafford/Lively are good roll men, but I doubt Kyrie would be as effective getting them the ball as Luka. AD pretty much plays a similar roll (although much better), but all three of them aren't great floor spacers, and I'm not sure what their go-to half court offensive would be now. I similarly don't think Dinwiddie would be that great running the floor, and the rest of the Dallas core are 3 and D wings. Running lineups of AD + one of Gafford/Lively also pushes PJ to the 3, which I think isn't his strong suit. In sum, the defensive fit seems great, but there's a lot of positional redundancy on offense and not enough facilitating for it to be effective.

In terms of who the Mavs could have gotten from other teams, I'd like to think that anyone outside of Jokic, Wemby, Giannis, Shai, and Tatum were on the table. I doubt Phoenix refuses to trade Booker or that the Twolves would rather have Ant over Luka. Both of them provide better fits imo to how the current Mavs team is built.

I think the bigger question is if the Mavs could have landed multiple great players for Luka. Would the Sixers have been willing to give up PG, Maxey, and McCain? You talk about not wanting to rock the boat, but if the Mavs had asked  for Jdub and Chet, would OKC really have passed on creating the best backcourt in NBA history? Similarly, would Boston have said no if Dallas wanted Brown and White? Would Cleveland have passed on giving up Mitchell and Mobley in return for a proven playoff leader? I know his dad works for the front office, but would the Knicks really value Brunson and OG to the point of saying no to the potential of a generational player? It seems that Nico didn't even ask around regarding these options, and that's even crazier than trading Luka to me. || Maxey, McCain, and picks for Luka? Philly prays for health and would have an insane starting lineup when healthy. Luka and Embiid would be a turbocharged version of Harden and Embiid. For Dallas it gives them a new backcourt of extremely promising young talent. I guess even this is way more of a future plan than a win now though. They would need to make a second trade for a big.

Maybe if the Mavs could've gotten Garland and Jarrett Allen or something. Maybe Mobley and Garland? That feels substantially more fair than what the Mavs actually got. But I kind of doubt the Cavs would want to blow up their squad right now. || Most of what I disagree with when it comes to the trade is the rationale. I don’t think they’re the kind of team to be making a win now trade. If anything, I think they’ve been getting worse over the years and it’s just been covered by Luka getting better.

Given the parameters, I think the Lakers actually have the best offer in this situation with AD, but I would assume Reaves + both picks come back. 

I think Giannis from Milwaukee is worth a call. Their window is shutting rapidly and they’re out of assets. 

On one hand I don’t think the Celtics would want to mess with what they’ve got, but Tatum for Luka 1:1 would probably be good for both sides. 

The Cavs are sitting pretty but they haven’t had post season success really - I would again be careful assuming that they wouldn’t be interested, this is Luka Doncic we’re talking about. I think that goes for most teams, they might not be looking to trade but things change when it’s a franchise level player. Mobley + more is more than reasonable to expect. || The problem is that you are making a ton of assumptions that you wouldn't have to make if they actually shopped the deal like they should have. Beyond Wemby and Jokic do we REALLY know anyone else would be off the table? And w/o talking to Doncic do we know which teams he would give the thumbs up to?

The reality is that with a prize as shiny as Doncic we have no way to know what lengths teams would have gone to get him, but we do KNOW they would have been willing to put up a lot more than what Dallas got. || The Knicks would absolutely sniff around a deal for Luka. I think the Cavs and Celtics would too. || Anything on the roster not named Evan Mobley, and any pick/pick swap we have available. Can't pass on the opportunity to get a guy who, at worst, is a top 5 player in the league. || As a Heat fan, and considering they wanted AD. Jimmy, Bam, a FRP and a couple SRP. Love Bam but it’s Luka, Jimmy is out anyways, and hell the picks could basically be adjusted to almost any amount. || Fun thought experiment! 

For most of these teams, Dallas would also get a bunch of first round picks. I think that is one interesting part is that they could have likely got a good selection of players from one team and picks, then used those picks for another good  player from another team if they really wanted to win now.

Just listing the main players below, Im sure any trade would also include more minor players like Max Christie as well.

Atl- Trae Young, Dyson Daniels, Okongwu

Cleveland- Evan Mobley, Donovan Mitchel,

Miami- Bam, Tyler Herro

Phoenix- Devin Booker, Kevin Durrant

Golden State- Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Kuminga

Memphis- JJJ, Bane,

Houston- Amen Thompson, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr,

NYK- Some combo of Jalen Brunson, KAT, OG, Hart

Orlando- Wagner, Paolo, Goga, Isaac,

**I think OKC would have likely paid the most. A hoard of draft picks, Chet, Jalen Williams, Caruso,Hartenstein what ever other small peices they want. Then they could turn around and sell that hoard of draft picks for another really good player if they wanted to.**

None of these players may be as good as AD individually, but the package of them likely exceeds his value, especially if on top of the players they also received a bunch of draft picks or young players that they could flip to another team for another good player. || Rockets delegation here. Take your pick of the roster and draft assets. Build your own package. || If I'm the Mavs, I call up OKC. I tell Presti ""Luka is on the market, I'm wondering if I could strike a deal here"". I tell Presti I want one of SGA or Holmgren, and at least six of their first round picks. SGA or Holmgren + 6 FRP for Luka is more like a package I'd consider for my franchise player. The Thunder have the assets to pull it off. Slim chance they consider it, but that package is way better than any other team could scrap together. || Totally bullshit thinking AD will bring win now situation than Luka. 

There is no playmaker in this team now and all role players in this team are for Luka doncic. Ad fails to be the #1 guy in lakers, how come you will think it is a good deal for Dallas. Lakers fans are all bias, keep convincing this trade is not stupid for mavs || Might have been able to do jokic and mpj for like their 5 and Luka but it really makes no sense and would never happen ||  there isn’t one, Luka at his best is top 3 in the league or even top 2. 

For a long term solution I’d have tried to get a young blue chipper (ie; Brandon Miller, Franz/Paolo, etc), another solid young piece, another flippable piece to turn into more pieces, on top of a boaaaaaaatload of picks. || Here is the best ""win now"" scenario for the Dallas Mavericks:

Keep Luka Doncic. || The financials were also important. The deal leaves the Mavs just $171k under the 1st apron and the Lakers $1.6M under the 2nd apron. It's why the Jazz got two 2nd rounders to accept Jalen Hood-Schino's contract. 

The 2nd apron is almost a hard cap in the new CBA. || Not sure I agree with your parameters here.

I’ve seen a lot of people arguing the same as you - “who would they realistically get who would be better than AD to win now?!” But I think it’s a flawed assumption.

Even IF we are putting aside the fact that Luka is obviously still a win now player and you’re just done with him and want him gone *and* you want to compete right now, I still disagree that it has to be a direct trade for a guy like AD.

Say they shop Luka around and there’s an offer for like…8 first round picks or something. You could easily still turn say..3 of those into AD from the lakers. You could get multiple teams involved and make sure you’re getting a good return but that starts to get really messy and complicated.

I think the premise of “oh it really wasn’t that bad, AD is the best guy they could have gotten in return, he lets them compete now!” is still - intentionally or not - giving Nico a pass on the terrible return that he got.

That’s why the deal is so terrible. He *still* could have gotten AD even if that was his dream player. Just with more of a return.

If you want a ham sandwich and don’t have cash on you, you don’t trade a Rolex directly for the ham sandwich. You sell the Rolex, buy the ham sandwich at market price and then pocket the rest (not a perfect analogy because obviously AD isn’t a ham sandwich). || [removed] || I don't disagree that Rob fleeced the Mavs by saving Reaves, knecht and more picks. Agreed there. But I think there's validity in wanting to work in silence so that you don't lose control, and obviously the cost of that silence was being able to fully squeeze the lemon. 

JJJ and Bane - one of the better realistic suggestions, I just struggle to see how Ja and Luka can fit together. But interesting to say the least. 
Bam and Herro - probably the best suggestion, but this honestly might kill Pat Riley's Heat Culture by sending out the gritty guys, bringing in a guy accused of work ethic issues, and still holding the bag on Jimmy
Chet and Williams - I don't think they'd do it. The thunder are absolutely flying and they don't seem to want to rock the boat. I actually think they are just gonna trade 1 upcoming pick for 2 future picks forever and just maintain their stupid stockpile until this core moves on too, and just do iHart/Caruso style deals and keep the core together. || Not really, he has been hurt more than half the year. This is a team that is .5 games from not even being in the play-in, so on that kind of time scale having AD for 30 more games vs. Luka for 20 makes a difference. The Lakers have more of a cushion built in to wait for him to get healthy.

Also the obvious downside of trying to squeeze somebody in a trade like this is they say “nah we’ll just wait to sign him after next season” and then it comes out that you were trying to shop Luka and he’s pissed. 

None of these small-market teams you mention would like their chances of re-signing Luka and it’s not like Memphis in that scenario would be competitive with the top teams in the league. That would be a worse version of the Lakers where they’d have no defense and Ja is a worse fit off the ball than LeBron. Bam and Herro make like $30 million more more than AD + Christie, so that would have required Miami to take a bunch of dead salary while also trading picks when they don’t have any until 2029. That far in advance I would definitely value a Lakers pick over a Heat one just by virtue of the West being tougher.

Bottom line though is that 90 percent of the league will talk a good game but their owners would rather be decent and collect luxury tax than great and pay luxury tax. The Heat were avoiding the luxury tax when they had peak LeBron and it was not nearly as punitive as the 2nd apron is now. || Mavs should have gotten Knecht and the other way round pick at a minimum, then maybe you can justify it. But honestly the fan backlash has nothing to do with the compensation. Luka was Dirks replacement, the Slovenian wonder boy. || Reportedly they were close to getting all that, and Pelinka pushed back to get Knect and the other FRP off the table.  Again, just insanely bad negotiating from Harrison.  As long as the deal was quiet, **he** should have been the one pushing for more.  

Klutch and AD/LeBron are already at odds with LAL, Pelinka is the one that would have taken more initial heat for shopping AD.  Nobody would have believed that DAL was seriously shopping Luka.

—————-

Back to OP’s question.  AD might have been the best individual player he could get back right this minute.

However, two teams stand out to me with better packages and near/mid-term return.  Knicks and Magic.  You want to push in all your chips for flexible defense and two way offense?  OG/Rob from the Knicks or WCJ(or Issac)/Franz from Orlando would be solid return.  Both include guys around top 20, compared to around top 10 AD, and a rim-protector.  Both also have a want/need for an on-ball creator.  Both could put together more draft capital to give the Mavs options for additional moves.

Hell, I could see the Heat offering a better all around package around Bam that would be appealing.  Bam/Jovic/Highsmith for Luka?  They have all their own picks from ‘28-‘31, plus seconds."

First of all people need to respect AD, one of the best two way players on this earth. Secondly, the mavs clearly weren’t interested in acquiring a haul of picks. Nico said he wants to win now so what are some better options that would’ve made sense for both teams?

I believe that Wemby Shai Jokic and maybe Giannis are all untouchable. The fallout from trading away any of these four would be too much. So that leaves you with Tatum (who i’d argue is untouchable) Steph, KD, D Book, Ja, Lebron, Lamelo, and Cade? Are any of these players a better option than AD? I don’t think so.

The best move would’ve been to not do the trade. But if the Mavs were deadset on trading Luka before the deadline and entering win now mode, I think AD was the best option for that.

That's why this is so shocking to everybody.


They could've at least waited til the offseason. || Shit they left another first round pick, Reaves and Knecht on the table. Absolutely insanely horrible even if Luka had demanded a trade to the Lakers specifically, when you factor in that Luka didn’t even ask out at all and it’s pretty clearly the worst trade in sports history which is insane to say 12 hours after it’s been made. || Maybe but that’s an insanely stupid box to put yourself in to begin with. I know I am making my team worse but I’m still win now dammit! || Look, I'm a Lakers fan so I appreciate the Mavs going easy on us, but put yourself in Lakers' shoes. If Mavs came back before the trade consummated and asked for another FRP, another few SRPs, or another piece (maybe Reaves, Vando, or Rui) that can be helpful to your run or further flipped, do you really say no to getting Luka Doncic?

So yes, maybe AD was the best they could've gotten as a headliner, but I think the package overall could've been better and thus appear less lopsided. I don't know what kind of hard ball Rob Pelinka played, but I know Nico Harrison shouldn't have gone along with it. || No they could not have , they wanted to slant defense + they got a Top 7-8 player. || Even if Doncic had to be traded, they should have taken the Lawers for everything, and Pelinka would have been happy to oblige. All the Lakers available 1st round picks should have been gotten, including Reaves and Knect. If you Don't want those guys trade them to another team for more picks. || People really underrate defense a lot and so AD is also always severely underrated || For starters they could have easily gotten Reaves and an extra pick from LA. AD + Reaves + 2FRPs isnt anywhere near as bad. 

AD is kinda redundant, they already have great rim protection and help defense, they need ball handling, playamking and over the top shotmaking, all of which Luka was responsible for. 

Their main issue is now Kyrie is the only player on the entire team that can reliably create his own shot in the playoffs. He is now also responsible  for creating everyone else's shots too. Their starting 5 will have 3 non shooters and 3 non creators. AD and Kyrie will be entirely responsible for the offense and I think that is too much of a role for them to handle.

AD is good, but overall they would have been better with like Ja + Bane or JJJ. I think Franz + picks would have been better. Cade + picks too. Basically any young star with superstar potential + picks to make other deals would have been superior to AD. || There are probably only 4 players in the NBA who their team would not trade straight up for Luka: Jokic, SGA, Giannis, Wemby.  Maybe throw Tatum on that list, although I think the Celts would do this because of the money difference since Tatum's supermax starts next year.  So anybody second team All-NBA and lower would be fair game, and most of them are younger than AD.  Jaylen Brown?  Done.  Anthony Edwards?  Done.  Devin Booker?  Done.  DMitch?  Done.  Want a younger player with star defensive ability on a cheaper contract?  Evan Mobley, Chet Holmgren, Bam Adebayo, Jaren Jackson Jr wouldn't be untouchable for Luka. || I really don't think so -- like, the five untouchables you named and Luka is the full list of players I'm confident are better than AD right now. Out of the guys who are around as good as AD, a good number are small guards you wouldn't want to pair with Kyrie, and then even if other players like KD, Ant, Mitchell, and Booker would probably fit fine next to Kyrie, I don't think it's crazy to prioritize a defensive number one and hope your role players can step up into slightly bigger offensive roles.

That said, they're probably supposed to trade one of Lively or Gafford now, and it probably would've been nice for them to get another asset to use there || They could have easily secured the Mavs current AND future rosters with the haul Luka would have provided. Either Nico Harrison smoked too much crack and hit ""send"" on trade or there is some weird shit going on behind the scenes that is currently being kept secret. || The best package they could've gotten is no package because you don't trade luka doncic || That's like saying Miami should've traded LeBron for Paul  Pierce after losing in 2011 because he would've been a better fit. 

How on earth are you declaring win-now mode by trading a guy like Luka Doncic? Who led you to the finals with PJ as his third option, who wasn't even a third option in Charlotte? || Giannis is 100% tradable if you're getting Luka in return. Dallas got absolutely fucked in this deal, its been reported they didn't even get everything they wanted from the Lakers that's how bad it was || Yes, because even if they ended up doing the deal with the Lakers, if they had courted bids from the entire league, it would have forced the Lakers to improve their bid. It is preposterous to complete that trade and not also have AR-15 or Dalton Knecht. When you have a highly valued asset, you leverage it in the market even if you have a particular partner in mind.

We're talking about an individual who can have an billion+ dollar impact on your franchise, and the bidding process couldn't even get a Sotheby's auction treatment. || “The fallout from trading away any of these four would be too much” - you, actively defending trading away the only other person you could add to this list || If you're in win-now mode you build around your star, you don't trade him for a worse player. I don't even see how they're better in the short-term so I'm baffled. Their ceiling feels much lower to me. 


Teams without a reliable shot-creator and playmaker don't have championship aspirations, and while Kyrie is very good in certain ways he's a 32 year old who has never proven he can be an effective first option on a contender so I don't understand why they think he'll suddenly become one.


AD is probably underrated in all of this but it really feels like you smashed a couple 1B players together and hoped for the best when you already had a top 3 franchise cornerstone in the league on the roster.


I guess what it comes down to is: you have a 25 year old first team All-NBA player. Why are you in ""win now"" mode when your goal should be to win a championship with him within the next 5-7 years?


One of the things I keep telling myself about Luka is that he is still young enough that we may not have seen the best version of him yet. Usually there's a year 26-28 year old leap for the real superstars so the next level for the franchise could have been that Luka started to address the few faults that he had and reached an even higher level. Lebron truly ascended at age 27, that second year on Miami. What if Luka was destined for a similar leap and the Mavericks sold low right before Luka really peaked? Why bet against him?


That's a long way of saying: the win-now move may have been to do nothing or try to improve on the margins. Or try to spin Kyrie into a different piece if you feel that you need to. || They should've gotten at least 4 FRPs. I mean didn't the Knicks spend 5 for bridges just this last summer? Or the gobert trade?  || I’m a rockets fan and I’m upset, they didn’t even talk with other teams that would’ve given them anything. Nico is in the lakers or Adam silvers pocket bc this a joke and I feel for Mavs fans || Since nobody knows what other teams would have been willing to pay for Luka, it’s impossible to give a serious answer. But if you look at what has been paid for stars in the last 10 years, especially 5 years, you get the feeling that it was too cheap. There should have been at least 2 more valuable picks. || They could have asked to more teams, they have just asked to two teams.. Shitshow.. || It's not win now

They lost an mvp candidate who took them to the finals
They missed out on assets for no reason

Stop believing everything you hear

That's what they want

This is corruption || yeah ad and 5 picks sets you up way better to tool around your all-in roster than ad max christie and 1 pick || If I was them I would have tried to get two next up players, who you can see are going to be great, I don't think Orlando would have done Paolo + Franz but something of that vein || They could have gotten, AD, Reaves, and both first round picks at least lol || They could have done better while still trading with the Lakers. They left picks and players on the table. || But no one can name what this magical better deal would even look like haha || Off season for sure would have been better || The fact that they didn't even get knecht who looks like he's going to be a legit player is what really sells me on the conspiracy that Nico is actually in the Lakers pocket some how. || Fr force Lakers to trade Reaves/Rui for whatever and picks and get those picks too. Squeeze every asset you can. Maybe even just send Klay for Reaves straight up. Send them Hardy and get all of their youth. Get swap on every single FRP they have. Mavs just left a lot of free food on the table for no reason. They could’ve used any asset there for a win now move."

However recently I have seen fans and players complain about his patent shoulder bump to create space in the mid range saying it should be an offensive foul. Personally I don’t think anything of it because all offensive players initiate some sort of contact going to the rim to either create space or put the defense into a situation to foul, I look at that shoulder bump in a similar light. Giannis barrels into the lane with spin moves and euro’s all the time and gets called for offensive fouls but the difference is the defense has time to set itself into legal guarding position to draw the charge. You can’t do the same with SGA shoulder bump yet I constantly see players and fans a like complain about it. Do you think the NBA should look into that this off-season and do you think it is an offensive foul?",103,89,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1iy2olm/is_sgas_shoulder_bump_an_offensive_foul/,2025-02-25 13:55:55,"I personally hate when offensive players are driving with defender staying out of their way but moving with them only to have offensive player lunge sideways into them initiating the contact and then drawing a foul. I don’t watch much OKC so not speaking specifically about Shai here. It’s probably the main  thing I’d want the league to adjust rules on to help defenses a little bit. But, it’s always going to be tough in real time for refs to judge a natural vs unnatural lunge going into a shot. || It's not an offensive foul. It shouldn't be. If it were called an offensive foul the league would become a joke. 

Shoulder bumps are taught to serious basketball players as young as in high school.

You initiate contact with a defender that's not in perfect position with your shoulder. This is how smaller players can finish over larger ones in the paint, through contact. While one benefit is to draw fouls, the primary purpose is to get the defender off balance on your drives. It is no different than posting up and backing down and using your shoulder for contact. 

Kobe would initiate contact with his shoulder/body to finish over Tim Duncan. This has always existed. 

Shai's shoulder bumps are effective because he's a very shifty player who already puts defenders off balance.

Only using the elbow or arm to create space, that's a push off. That's illegal. That doesn't get called enough. || It depends on the arm extension.   A shoulder hit to the upper body is pretty much acceptable in todays era and should be a no call.  Push off with full arm extension should be whistled for an offensive foul imo.   

If defender can't hit the arm w/o being called a shooting foul,   offensive player should not be able to get room with a push off. || It's not an offensive foul according to how the game is currently called, but I think it should be. We're now in an era (and I mostly blame James Harden for this) where offensive players are incentivized to barrel into the lane with no plan but to bump into their defender and draw a foul, because most of the time they'll get the call. Based on what I've seen, there's almost nothing the defender can do to avoid this.

Allowing offensive players to basically be as physical as they want while defenders get called for the lightest touch fouls ranks pretty high on my list of my least favorite things about the state of the game in the NBA today. || If you don't blatantly push off with the arm, this has always been a no-call. Its not something new SGA came up with. || No. The thing is though that half the time they’re not shoulder bumps but full on push offs with his arm which make them an offensive foul. || If you think it's an offensive foul, then so were a bunch of MJs moves from the 90s. Or Kobes. Basically, all the eras that basketball pundits and fans glorify and want to bring back that toughness and mid range game, SGA does in spades.  I don't get where all the reddit hate comes from. || Basketball is a contact sport. I don’t mind offensive players doing it. My problem is when defensive players do it back or they hand check and they get called for it. || It's not because you are allowed to ""chicken wing"" your arm to create space. People confuse any kind of contact initiated by the offense to be an offensive foul when there's a certain tolerance/leniency the player gets. || In my opinion, if you can use your arms and shoulders to push off to create space then defender should be to block the players path and not get called for blocking fouls. It's only fair. Otherwise it should be removed as it's not a basketball move and it's definitely a foul. || A defender needs to occasionally eat a (flagrant) foul and just give a hard two-handed shove back, to put him off doing it and get the refs eyes closer on it. || I mean….was Paul Pierce using his shoulder an offensive foul? The way he used his body was what most of his game was predicated on and I’ve never seen anyone call it an offensive foul or baiting. || The same level of contact that is whistled a defensive foul should be whistled an offensive foul.

Now, if you want to argue that a little more of that contact should be let go defensively, I might agree with you. The league cutting down on ticky-tacky defensive fouls is good for the game. 

But a defender can't lower their shoulder and move intentionally into the offensive player to knock them to create space or disrupt their balance and footwork - so the offensive player shouldn't be able to do it to a defender. || They really only call the offensive foul if you’re using your non dribbling hand to push people away, even then that gets missed often because dudes are really crafty. Using your body to bump is generally considered legal as long as it isn’t an egregious football looking move. Small guys jump into bigs all the time to prevent their shot from getting blocked. || If he keeps his arm compact then no. At that point it’s just body on body. If he extends his arm/elbow then yes it should be a foul. || I don’t think people are upset that SGA isn’t being called for offensive fouls. It’s the touch fouls that he gets whistles that drives me bonkers.

There should be more no calls/play ons. || The way the game is called? Not a foul. You need full arm extension for it to truly be a push off. || Technically, you can argue that his forearm or shoulder can be used to defend his space and the ball as an offensive player, but a blatant push off with the forearm should be an offensive foul. || It should be. Offensive players should not be allowed to unnaturally initiate contact || It shouldn't be an offensive foul. I look at it in the same category as backing down or posting up a defender. Now, if a defender can predict when it's about to happen & clearly sets his feet with his arms to the side in a position to draw a charge & it's enough contact to knock the defender off his feet, it should be a charge. || The NBA is supposed to have a new rule; however it rarely gets called as intended, which basically states that a defended can move with the ball handler and they stay on their ""line of defense"" and does not move into the ball handler's path there is no foul if the ball handler jumps into the defender.  


It's an attempt to eliminate some of the foul bating by guys like SGA, Jimmy Butler and other ""foul merchants "" || I think the bigger issue is the asinine interpretation of continuation. If you go back and watch a game from the 90s it was called so much tighter that basically you had to be just about releasing the ball for them to consider it continuation || Man, I haven't been watching OKC games this year, and I didn't realise SGA played like this. Still, recently I watched JimmyHighrollers video on ""the Uenthical/ethical hooper"" where there are a ton of plays from SGA. As another user commented ""Before this video, I wasn't aware of SGA's foul baiting reputation. This video actually convinced me that he is doing exactly that."" I agree. 

I thought the NBA got rid of this kind of foulbaiting, but it's still going on, and I hate every second of it. 

Blatant foulbaiting should be an offensive foul. || As long as it's not excessive and the arm doesn't extend, no. || shoulder bump is not really a foul but there are a TON of illegal pushoffs that don’t get called in the league rn. tatum is the most consistent offender on his drives imo, but it’s not just him. the problem is, using your off arm to hold that space while moving is so similar to blatantly shoving that it’s not an easy call to make || I hate James Harden's style, but SGA is a little different. The problem is, when the other players try the same, the refs won't call. That's unfair. || Yes, it is. He uses it as a way to create separation between him and his defender. So it absolutely is an offensive foul. It's no different when Lebron does it || SGA does it perfectly. He jump bumps and rarely ever extends his arm. Paul George, Tatum and Steph are the ones who fully arm extend || If offensive players initiate contact it’s either no call or offensive depending on how/what they initiate with. SGA is both a beast and a foul baiter. He’s not harden level baiting but it’s still lame to see him get so many calls || It is, and teams will start to flop/embellish his push off and draw offensive fouls"

Will they make a deep run?,"I've been posting analytics (some of you hate them, but look at how accurate they turned out to be) and other facts here that suggested the Warriors would get 6th soon (check my posts). I missed by a couple of days because of Grimes playing the fakest game of his life. 

Warriors last 10 (8-2)

120.9 OffRtg (3rd; ≈2nd on the season)
107.4 DefRtg (3rd; ≈2nd on the season)
13.5 NetRtg (3rd; ≈1st on the season)

Steph (4) & Jimmy (8) both T10 NetRtg (mins≥28 & usg≥20%). Only CLE has more than 1 T10 Net guy.

Steph: 29.5/4/7 on 51/42/88 splits & 69 TS%. 

Steph only trails Jokic & Shai on offense (per DunksAndThrees). He's also 7th in the league in overall impact (per DunksAndThrees). He's basically 37 years old. No other player in the Top 10 in impact is over 30 (Giannis is 30).

The Warriors are elite again and Steph is quietly having an MVP esque second half to the season at age 37. He also has the most 50 point games after 30. As things progress, we're seeing that Steph has unprecedented longevity. Especially for a small guard. His all-time rankings will continue to climb if he keeps this up.

Warriors are currently ranked 4th on DunksAndThrees, behind OKC, CLE, and BOS. They also have a whopping 17 games with a 55%+ win probability (per DunksAndThrees). Their schedule strength up to this point has been one of the toughest in the league. Their remaining schedule strength is much weaker. The combination of adding Jimmy and facing weaker competition strongly suggests they are likely to hold onto 6th and have a small chance of climbing to 5th.

They're 2-1 vs OKC, 2-1 vs MEM, 2-1 vs HOU, and 3-1 vs MIN. Before Jimmy. Seems that if they avoid potentially tougher matchups like the Lakers and Denver, they could make a big run in the Western Conference and maybe end up in the NBA Finals. Would they then face Boston? With not one, but TWO Celtics Killers in Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler?

However, we still have some glaring holes in our game, and don't really have a clear 3rd scoring option without Kuminga. Quinten Post is getting there as a reliable spacer, so him Jimmy and JK will feast. I hope JK can focus more on 1v1 defense, cause our perimeter defense can do better honestly. || There’s an unlikely reality they end up on the opposite side of the bracket to Nuggets/Lakers and if they’re very lucky OKC too

In that case, I could definitely see it. If they have to go through all 3 of those teams (likeliest outcome if they finish 6 or 7), I’d very seriously doubt it  || In my opinion, we get trashed by OKC, Lakers... and we can compete decently with wolves, nuggets, grizzlies, rockets and clippers. Specifically with the nuggets we can't stop Joker but we can lock down everyone else and make Joker beat us himself. || I think one important thing to mention is that Jimmy does have an injury history, having missed the playoffs last year due to getting injured. Part of that is obviously due to his age. But another part of that is his style of play does usually result in a lot of contact, unlike Steph. 

You can say there is a lot less pressure on him to carry, then there was with the Heat. But even if he somehow makes the finals, I feel like he’d be pretty battered up by the bloodbath that is the West and not really able to perform. That’s what happened 2 years ago in the East, having to go 7 games against the Celtics. Whereas rn the East has two super teams that will have an intense series but otherwise be fresh for the Finals. || They schedule have consisted of bad teams, Milwaukee and Houston being the good teams they faced, and Bucks didn’t have Giannis and Rockets are trending down. Their record right now those mean much, I’d expect them to be 6-4 or 7-3 without Butler anyway, and the Orlando game was Steph being Steph, nothing to do with Butler arriving.

I do like what I’m seeing from them, specially how Steph is rejuvenated not being triple teamed and having more space to operate. They are winning because the offense overpowers teams. However, their offense still lacks shooters, their offensive rebounding could be better. If they have shooters out there, the defense sucks and forces Dray and Jimmy to over rotate. If they add good defenders than there’s just two shooters out there. I think their holes are clearer and mor exploitable than the other top5 teams. I’m putting them in the Bucks tier now, maybe Knicks. || I would never count out Steph or Jimmy butler in the playoffs. It would be crazy but no one thought Jimmy could take a playin team to the finals or that Steph would win with the 2022 team. || It really depends who they get in the first round. If they get 6th, and Denver/LA decide to ease off the gas to let Memphis/Houston face them in the first round, I can see GSW win that series. 

If GSW end up facing Denver or OKC in the first round, I can't see them winning that I'm afraid. 

If it's the Lakers, oh boy give me LeBron v Steph one more time. I do think GSW could win that but it can go either way. || [removed] || Imo they don't need ""too"" many things to go their way for them to make another deep run. They are older now so health will be the number one concern, but if Draymond, Butler, Steph can all stay healthy they will be able to beat any team in a series. Especially if Steph decides he wants to go nuclear, which is a possibility at anytime even at his age. Butler's smart game really complements Steph quite well and Steph can be good with anyone with his elite off ball movement.

Exciting time to be an NBA fan as it's far more than a 2 horse race for the championship. || Not like they have played good teams and when they have their stars have sat. 

Everyone was calling their run after all star break. Don’t they have the weakest schedule? || They played terrible teams in the last 10 lol.

They don’t have one win in that stretch where they weren’t massive favourites. || They have a long battle ahead and the most important thing for them is making sure they have Jimmy and Steph healthy come playoff time. If either one is not at full strength the Warriors are getting cooked by any playoff caliber team, so I would say they are more Cinderella’s ugly sister then a Cinderella || I am worried about the point of attack defence and general shot blocking/rim protecting. Draymond has always been a unique rim protector because he didn’t actually block shots and if the team is big/ athletic then he actually protection at the rim can be exposed but he is a great paint protector he plugs up holes and players don’t even get to the rim. But against the elite teams who have strong rim attacking and finishing I do think it can be a real issue. So draymond offers a supremely unique rim protection but I think there is considerable value of actual shot blocking that he doesn’t offer especially in 2025. I’m interested though. || I think them facing OKC would actually be one of their best bets.

I feel they're a sleeper pick for sure. regardless of what seed they get they have too much playoff experience. Lowkey Klay would be great - despite his meh play, he was an insane threat and quintessential to the 2022 ring || Warriors are dangerous. Draymond is a nightmare to deal with defensively and against someone like Chet, Dray very well could bully him. They have a lot of depth defensively too and of course the loaded front court of Steph curry and break out future all star Podz getting to their spots and Jimmy connecting with the team makes them a tough contender. || It would be nice, but they can’t survive the non-Steph and Jimmy minutes to save a life || [removed] || [removed] || They need to get to 4th or 5th seed. I don’t see them beating any of the top 3. || I hope so but they are so small and limited. If Steph isn’t on, I just have no idea how they make up the scoring. Sure, Jimmy is good to great but they hardly have scoring outside of these two. If Hield goes on a heater they could be a surprise, but they just look tiny out there and very limited offensively. 

I think they can out hustle people, unless they play Rockets or Thunder. If they can match up against a Clippers team or Memphis team I think they’d win the series. They’d probably hold their own against the Rockets, but it would be brutal given how hard the Rockets play. I’d be shocked if they could beat one of Lakers, OKC, Denver right now. Denver doesn’t seem that much better but they would abuse GS in the paint and it would just be so much easier for them to control the game. 

Again, I hope they make a run. However, they have a huge hill to climb. || I would love that but tbh I don’t see them beating OKC or Lakers. Maybe nuggets, but not Lakers or OKC for sure. 

Yea I’m aware they’ve won already but I mean in playoffs || It's going to be tough because the competition is stiff, but you can never count out Steph. Even though he's a step slower, he can night night any game if he's feeling it and has enough support (screeners and playmakers like Jimmy Buckets to draw some attention). 

Draymond is still somewhat surprisingly effective at what he does and Podziemski's obviously playing well. They have shooting off the bench in Hield and defense in GP2. 

My thing is I don't think they have enough depth. They're like 2 pieces short, especially against teams like the Thunder and Lakers. But can they make it to the WCF and beyond? It's def possible. Playoff Jimmy is a real thing and he never had anyone like Steph || The one thing that makes it hard to evaluate the Warriors is that this core clearly has an X-factor.  They know what it takes to win it all, better than anyone else in the league.  It’s tough to rattle that resolve if you’re an opponent with a theoretical upper-hand || GSW is interesting. They have all the talent they need in the wing and point guard. The problem is they don’t have a consistent big man who can hold his own and not get pushed around in the paint. || They have 3 stars who raise their games in the playoffs and a good coach. As long as they are healthy I expect them to make the WCF. || I think they end up 6th and I think they play the Lakers in the first round and I’m calling an upset. Warriors then play the T wolves who upset the 2 seed Nuggets in the second round and win in 7. Warriors then play a tough series but lose in 5 to the Thunder.  

So yes I see them making a run || Kuminga should be back before the end of the regular season right? || Fifth seed minimum is likely at the current pace. Rockets may not fall enough, but Memphis likely will with JJJ out and a brutal schedule ahead. Not going to say it's a guarantee, but I wouldn't say it's unlikely at all. || We are less than 20 games away and the seedinh looks relatively clear


Okc locked at 1st


Den/lakers 2nd/3rd with a cushion over mem/hou 4th/5th seeds


Gsw and minny with a 3~ losses gap below at 6/7 seeds


Clippers/sac with a small gap below at 8th/9th


Is possible that teams move out of these areas, maybe warriors continud on a war path and overcome the 4th/5th seeds for example but with only 20 games left margins are pretty tight for any of these teams to lose their 2/3 game cushions so dont expect many of them to end out of where they are now


The most likely bracket is okc vs clippers/kings against winner of memphis/rockets


Lakers/denver vs minnesota/clippers in the other side of the bracket || I think the Lakers matchup is more of a tossup, now that AD is gone - he's the guy that always killed the Warriors, and the Lakers have no one that can even pretend to guard Steph or Jimmy. That would be a fun match-up.

Jokic I agree. Can't see Draymond enjoying being tasked with holding off Jokic for extended minutes."

In fact, when compared to other scoring champs, he’s about average","SGA is shooting 8.9 FTA per game so far this season, good for 2nd this year (Giannis, 10.2). Since he’s probably going to end up being the scoring champion, I wanted to see how this stacks up against other scoring champions, and see if there’s really any truth to the free throw merchant allegations. 

TLDR; Since 86-87 there has been 13 seasons (out of 38) where the scoring leader shot less free throws than SGA this season. Carmelo Anthony and Steph Curry are the only scoring champions who have never had a season with more FTA than SGA this season. 7 of those 13 seasons are Michael Jordan. Elite scorers get fouled because they’re impossible to guard

Because I have organic chemistry homework and I don’t want to do this all night, I started in 86-87 (Jordan’s first scoring title), and looked at FTA for all players that led the league in scoring. Here’s what I found:

Last years scoring champion, Luka Doncic, averaged 8.7 FTA per game. In 2022-23 he shot 10.5 FTA per game and in 2019-20 he shot 9.2 FTA per game, giving him 2 seasons where he averaged more FTA than SGA this year. 

In the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons, Joel Embiid was the leading scorer. He averaged 11.8 FTA in 21-22 and 11.7 in 22-23. He also averaged 9.2 in 20-21 and 10.2 in 23-24, giving him 4 seasons with more FTA than SGA this season. 

Steph Curry was the scoring champion in 15-16 and 20-21. He averaged 5.1 in 15-16 and 6.3 in 20-21. He has never had a season above 6.3 FTA per game. 

James Harden was the scoring champ in 17-18, 18-19, and 19-20. In 17-18 he averaged 10.1 FTA, in 18-19 he averaged 11.0 FTA, and in 19-20 he averaged 11.8 FTA. He also averaged 10.9 in 16-17, 10.2 in 15-16, 10.2 in 14-15, 10.2 in 12-13, and 9.1 in 13-14, giving him 8 seasons with more FTA than SGA this year. 

Russell Westbrook was the scoring champ in 14-15 and 16-17. He averaged 9.8 FTA in 14-15 and 10.4 in 16-17. Those are his only 2 seasons with more FTA than SGA this year. 

Kevin Durant was the scoring champ in 09-10, 10-11, 11-12, and 13-14. In 09-10 he averaged 10.2 FTA, 8.7 in 10-11, 7.6 in 11-12, and 9.9 in 13-14. He also averaged 9.3 in 12-13, giving him 3 seasons with more FTA than SGA this season. 

Carmelo Anthony was the scoring champion in 12-13, averaging 7.6 FTA per game  In 09-10 and 05-06 he averaged 8.9 FTA per game, giving him 2 seasons where he was tied with SGA. 

In 08-09 Dwayne Wade was the scoring champion, averaging 9.8 FTA per game. He averaged 10.7 in 05-06, 10.5 in 06-07, 9.9 in 04-05, 9.2 in 07-08, and 9.1 in 09-10, giving him 6 seasons with more FTA than SGA this year. 

In 07-08 Lebron James was the scoring champion, averaging 10.3 FTA per game. He also averaged 10.3 in 05-06, 10.2 in 09-10, 9.4 in 08-09, and 9.0 in 06-07, giving him 5 seasons with more FTA than SGA this year. 

In 05-06 and 06-07, Kobe Bryant was the scoring champion, averaging 10.2 FTA in 05-06 and 10.0 in 06-07. He also averaged 10.1 in 04-05 and 9.0 in 07-08, giving him 4 seasons with more FTA than SGA this season. 

Tracy McGrady was scoring champion in 02-03 and 03-04. He averaged 9.7 FTA in 02-03 and 7.5 in 03-04. He has one season with more FTA than SGA this season. 

Allen Iverson was scoring champion in 04-05, 01-02, 00-01, and 98-99. He averaged 10.5 FTA in 04-05, 9.8 in 01-02, 10.1 in 00-01, 9.9 in 98-99. He also averaged 11.5 in 05-06, 9.7 in 07-08, 9.5 in 03-04, 9.4 in 06-07, 9.0 in 02-03, and 8.9 in 99-00, giving him 10 seasons with more FTA than SGA this season. 

(This one is formatted differently because MJ led the league in scoring way too many times). Michael Jordan was scoring champion in 86-87 (11.9), 87-88 (10.5), 88-89 (9.8), 89-90 (8.5), 90-91 (8.2), 91-92 (7.4), 92-93 (7.3), 95-96 (8.0), 96-97 (7.0), and 97-98 (8.8).

Giannis Antetokounmpo,"""Giannis Antetokounmpo"" OR ""Giannis"" OR ""Greek Freak"" OR ""The Greek Freak"" OR ""Antetokounmpo"" OR ""The Freak""",2025-03-11,nbadiscussion,1j9mf61,"The ""Puncher's Chance"" Contenders","In the past two playoffs, Luka Doncic and Jimmy Butler propelled their teams to the Finals from outside the inner circle of contenders. Here are four teams that could make a similar run this season.

I filled in for Tim Legler on the All-NBA pod with Adam Mares yesterday. We highlighted four teams with a puncher’s chance of making it to the NBA Finals.

**Western Conference:**

1. *Golden State Warriors:*

Here’s what I thought about the Jimmy Butler trade when it happened:

“Death line ups are back!!!

Okay, they might not be as juicy as those from the Kevin Durant era, but I doubt anything will ever come close to reaching that level of fear on a basketball court again.

I don’t know Jimmy Butler, and he seems pretty challenging to deal with when he’s not getting his way. However, I haven’t seen anyone unhappy while playing basketball with Steph Curry during the season's most crucial games.

My friend Kevin Pangos often says that the most important thing to remember when choosing the right college during recruitment is:

Go somewhere where they have had success coaching a player like you before.

If Andre Iguodala was the original, then Jimmy Butler is the remix, baby!

\^\^ Shout out to Jalen Rose!

*Mike Dunleavy Jr. was a teammate of a young Jimmy Butler in Chicago, which is significant. Former teammates share a bond that allows open and honest communication that non-teammates cannot achieve as quickly.*

Golden State has been lights out since acquiring Butler at the February 6th trade deadline! Sporting a 12-2 record, while ranking in the top five of offensive, defensive, and NET rating:

* O: 119.8 (5th)
* D: 109.5 (4th)
* NET: +10.2 (4th)

My favorite things about this team is that they know exactly how and where they can bring two players to the basketball…

Steph Curry is this team's north star, and his PnR actions guarantee high-level offense for either himself (if you don’t blitz) or his teammates (if you do blitz).

In PnR situations, Curry leads the league in average distance from the hoop (29.2), and during his last trip to the playoffs, he was the most blitzed player in PnR actions, registering a rate above 30%!!

This distance and blitz rate combination in Curry’s PnR actions sets up Green and Butler as the decision makers in 4v3 advanagtae actions, where they both thrive!

This team knows who they are, and they all have championship experience. They *will* make noise when the playoffs roll around.

1. *Minnesota Timberwolves:*

No matter if it’s the NCAA Tournament, EuroLeague Final 4, or the NBA playoffs, it’s vital to be peaking at the right time, and this team is doing exactly that.

Minnesota is 10-0 over the last ten games that Julius Randle has played in and currently spots a top-10 Offensive, Defensive, and NET rating for the season.

During Randle’s previous 43 games, he averaged 4.5 assists, 3.0 turnovers, and 7.75 potential assists per game.

However, during this stretch since Randle returned from injury, he’s averaging 5.5 assists, 2.3 turnovers, and 9.8 potential assists per game. That’s 26% more potential assist per game than in November, December, and January.  
  
I believe that Randle’s time watching the team when he was injured gave him a new perspective of where he could fit in best and what the team needed from him to hit their ceiling. Sometimes sitting out can help a player see the bigger picture, and Randle’s new perspective has been a key element in Minnesota's hitting its stride at precisely the right time.

**Eastern Conference:**



1. *Milwaukee Bucks:*

Whenever you have a Monstars player on your team, you’ve got a chance, and Giannis Antetokounmpo is just that—otherworldly.

Since starting the season 2-8, Milwaukee has kicked it into gear. They’re 34-20 since that stretch, including impressive wins in playoff-esque situations via the NBA Cup (it just means more!).

**Lillard + Antetokounmpo Two Man Games:**

* PnR: 21.2 Per 100 | 1.117 Points Per Direct | *4.12 Blitz Rate* |
* Handoff: 5.889 Per 100 | 1.162 Points Per Direct | *24.2 Avg. Distance From Hoop* |

Good luck guarding this action…

Antetokounmpo is the ideal blitz deterrent for Lillard. The fear of letting Antetokounmpo play 4v3 downhill makes defenses reconsider coming to the level, allowing Lillard semi-open pull-up three opportunities. A 4.12 blitz rate for a shooter like Lillard is unheard of. These guys are figuring out how to amplify each other, and it’s fun!

The 24.2 average distance from the hoop pops on film as well. Many times, the handoff action feels like a bailout option for Antetokounmpo. There's more juice to be squeezed from this action by extending it further, creating more space behind the action for Antetokounmpo to attack in a 4v3 situation.

Last season, we didn’t get to see what type of fear Lillard and Antetokounmpo would create in a series together. I’m excited to see it this year.

1. *Indiana Pacers:*

Only one team this season has two of the top 5 PnR combinations in the league, the Indiana Pacers.

**Haliburton PnR Partners:**

* Turner: 23.2 Per 100 | 1.222 Points Per Direct | *3rd Best PnR in NBA* |
* Siakam: 15.2 Per 100 | 1.207 Points Per Direct | *4th Best PnR in NBA\\*

When playoff basketball starts, Indiana knows its primary, secondary, and emergency actions. I like teams where everyone knows the goal and no one cares who gets the credit.

No one embodies that statement more than Andrew Nembhard. When Nembhard and Haliburton are on the court together, this is one of the best teams in the league.

Per CLG, they’ve shared the court for 2,315 possessions this season and sport a +9.4 NET rating over that span.

When it comes to what is traditionally known as role players, two things separate the top-end ones from the rest, and Nembhard has both:

1. **Self-awareness:**

An internal understanding of where you stand in the pecking order within every lineup you’re involved in. This is the most important thing for a “role player.”

Every one of these guys has always been the best player on any team they’ve played on before making it to the NBA; having the self-awareness to know and accept that this has changed is a hard step for a player to grasp.

The top-end role players understand this easily, accept it willingly, and enthusiastically attack ways to be the connective tissue within lineups.

1. **Amplification:**

Can your game amplify the star player?!

A true star can amplify almost any role player, but the top-end role players know how to relieve pressure and turn a star’s strengths into superpowers!

Nembhard is in the upper quadrant of both of these key separators.

His game is the basketball version of a boxer throwing body punches. It’s not a string of loud and flashy highlight plays; you don’t see the damage he’s doing with the naked eye, but every second he is out there, he’s making life hell on both ends of the floor and wearing his opponents down.

On defense, he has some of the strongest feet and hands in the league. He uses his size to his advantage to win the leverage battle against bigger players, similar to what Draymond Green does when defending bigger players in post-up situations.

He’s consistently getting deflections, never getting screened, and rotating early to cover for his teammates.

Everything he does defensively eats up valuable time and energy from the opposing team’s star guards while giving his stars a chance to rest.

On offense, he’s one of the best Swiss army knives in the league. He can play on the ball to save Haliburton from full-court pressure and depleting energy 94 feet away from the basket.

He can run the PnR when Haliburton sits; according to Second Spectrum, he’s currently averaging 1.100 PPD PnR this season, which is in the 85th percentile.

Off-ball play suits his game just fine, too. He’s capable of spacing the floor enough (35% career 3-point shooter) to hold defenders, allowing Haliburton and Siakam space to operate in tandem or isolation. 

I don't think any of these teams will win it all this year, but I wouldn't be shocked to see one of them take down a top-tier contender from the Oklahoma City, Boston, Cleveland, Denver, and Los Angeles group.",242,51,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1j9mf61/the_punchers_chance_contenders/,2025-03-12 11:18:35,"Excellent write up and discussion! 

Shocked at the Butler fit with GSW, but it looks scary and strong. I guess it shouldn't be a surprise that a fiendish competitor who absolutely smashes inside-to-midrange would do well when Curry is your deep ball threat constantly hahahaha

Wolves heating up at the perfect time, like you said. Haven't watched much since their run tho. 

 Giannis gives any team a chance, but I do think they lack supporting depth to make a long playoff run even with Giannis at full strength. Again, depending on injuries come playoffs sometimes 1 Giannis is worth 3 guys off the bench. Lmao 

Pacers..... Tyrese needs to be hot for the entire run or it might not work. If hes playing scared (beating his man to the basket then passing instead of layup) then all the support doesnt matter. It removes him as an interior threat and teams just wait for the kick out. Nemby gonna put some opposing guards into Nembhell tho, can see him frustrating players to the point of tilting them over a 7 game series (Brunson, Lilliard last playoffs come to mind). || Great writeup as usual bro. Really don't know what to make about the Warriors since I haven't had a chance to watch them since the trade, but they're winning pretty convincingly and are led by two notable playoff risers. I'm really excited to watch them though; traditionally, teams led by old but experienced players don't perform well in the playoffs but everything I've read about these guys indicates they have the legs.

Only caveat I haven't seen levied against them -- their schedule in the past 14 has been a little weak. Brooklyn, Philly, Chicago, Dallas x2, Charlotte x3 (!!!). They've still beaten good teams (New York, Detroit) but I need to see them play some bigger competition. Their three game stretch of New York - Denver - Milwaukee over 4 days will show a lot IMO || No Knicks? Certainly there are some metrics as outlined here for these four teams that would allow one to make a reasonable case for them as well (Currently 9th best offensive rating in NBA history). Considering that ""inner circle"" list currently is OKC, DEN, CLE, BOS, I would assume Knicks would be on a list like this. || Apart from what you said, the Wolves are finally playing Randle without pretending he's KAT. He looks a lot more at ease in the offence

Watch his knees explode two games before the playoffs || I think GS is the only one of them who seriously has a chance to go all the way, but minn mil and Indiana could upset almost any team in a series. Just don’t think they have what it takes to do that 4 times  || Here's a link to the full podcast if anyone wants to check it out:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOpEVSurqAk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOpEVSurqAk) || I'm probably a lunatic for saying this and I think it's probably less than a 1% chance (and certainly less than any team mentioned in OP and probably on par with Knicks and Grizzlies) but I think the Clippers have a tiny, near microscopic level championship window if a lot of things go their way (and probably a lot of things go against their playoff opponents way)

  
Problem is it's the Clippers and historically, things have notoriously **not** gone their way at all. || Great piece! It is good to see recognition of Andrew Nembhard like this. There's folks on our sub who think he contributes very little. You phrased why they are wrong so nicely here: 

>His game is the basketball version of a boxer throwing body punches. It’s not a string of loud and flashy highlight plays; you don’t see the damage he’s doing with the naked eye, but every second he is out there, he’s making life hell on both ends of the floor and wearing his opponents down.

We are weak overall on defense, too many neutral/negative players on the roster to really be effective, so guys like Nembhard and Nesmith (who definitely deserves recognition as well) make a huge difference to our ability to compete and I suspect they will really shine in the Play-Offs just like they did last year. 

I think the final draw will have a huge impact on whether we can push through to the ECF. It looks like we'll be 4/5 (I think it is reasonable to expect Pacers 4th and Detroit may snag 5th in which case the Bucks will face NY, simply due to the strength of their final stretch opponents) and although a mouth watering prospect, I think we'll have enough to dispatch Detroit to set up a second round versus the Cavs. And well, they've been superb, so that will be a huge challenge, but who knows... who knows... || Aside from the 04 Pistons, no team in 4 decades has won a title without a player selected to 1st team all-NBA in seasons prior to the title run. (The one other exception is the first warriors run which was also Steph’s 1st year being 1st team)

If this “rule” holds true once again, we can pretty safely remove the Pacers and Wolves as contenders. The Cavs have the best chance of breaking the rule as this will be Mitchell’s first year being select 1st team. 

Reality is that it’ll be Boston, OKC, Cavs or Denver winning it this year and the true dark horses are the Warriors and Lakers. || I completely agree with the Bucks and Warriors to have more than a punchers chance like the Mavs last year.  It only takes 4 games to win a series.  Here’s why I believe they have a decent shot to make it to the finals.

1. Best player: Having the potential best player on every series is the #1 most important thing to any contender. Both have it in Giannis & Steph, and to a lesser extent Dame & Butler who could go nuclear at any moment. 

2. Experience/Clutch factor:  both teams/stars are as battle-tested in the playoffs as any contender, and will most likely perform well if the game gets close.  They are capable of making clutch stops to game winning shots.

3. 3 pointer: In this day and age, the 3 pointer is as crucial, if not more important than layups (crazy as it may seem).  Getting hot from 3 for a game or two can easily swing a series since you only need a couple more games from your stars to show up.

4. Luck of the draw/Injuries: Apart from the best player, this might be the most important one. Getting an excellent draw might mean an early exit or a cinderella run to the finals.  If the Celtics & Nuggets get bounced early, both the Bucks & Warriors have a decent shot to make a run at the finals like the Mavs did last year. || [removed] || You're missing a few teams according to a top sports book. I agree with everyone on your list but Leaving out the Lakers, Barring health they look dangerous and could possibly make a deep run if all their cards fall into place (what team doesn't need luck to make a deep run any given year?)

Top 8 teams according to bovada sports book to win NBA title as of 3/12/25

OKC +205

Boston +210

Cleveland +550

LA lakers +550 (I doubt lakers are even money with Cleveland on chance to win it all, Mitchell once again being criminally underrated)

GSW +1000

Nuggets +1200

Knicks +2500

Bucks +4500 || Thanks for checking it out. I posted this above and talked a lot about it in the pod, but yeah, GSW has a formula that works with Curry, and Jimmy is a glove-to-hand fit for that.

I think all the other teams are a cut below GSW for me but Giannis could wreck any 7 games series if he's got it going. || I feel like Bucks have the best supporting depth they have had ever in Giannis career (bucks had better starters during their title run). The bucks are missing Bobby Portis who has been their number 1 scoring off bench for years and have arguably been better. KPJ is playing his best. Trent and Green are starting caliber players on the bench and Sims has been capable as a center backup. Once BP comes back they legit go 10 deep where 4-9 seem interchangeable and Sims can backup Brook. What could doom the bucks is their starting group of Dame-Prince-Kuz-Giannis-Brook seems suboptimal.  || Charlotte was two games. Impossible for three games since non conference matchups are only two games per regular season. || Thanks for checking it out. My take on that would be they can only play who is on the schedule, and since this version of the team is only together for 14 games, that's all we got.

The film looks great, though, and they have a known formula for players around Curry that, when executed, can result in a championship (I talk about this a lot in the pod for GSW but also some other teams). || I feel like the Knicks have more than a punchers chance, even if they aren’t inner circle || There is a case that can be made for them, but not one I would want to make. I love Brunson and believe he's a terrific playoff performer, but I don't like the construct around him as much as other teams. I think the film on them is pretty cut and dry, and I'm willing to bet that Bridges and Hart can't shoot it well enough over 7 games to beat Boston or Cleveland. Just my take on it; I've been wrong before but that would be my position on New York. || I like the Knicks, but they've got a number of critical weaknesses:
1. Defence is frighteningly poor for a Thibs team starting Anunoby, Bridges and Hart. KAT displays 0 effort on D a lot of the time and Brunson can be easily exploited
2. Offence is very basic and defaults to what feels like 100% Brunson isos in the 4th quarter
3. Health - we see it nearly every year with Thibs teams. By the time the team gets to the playoffs they're running on fumes. Brunson is already out with a severe sprain and KAT hasn't looked the same for months since his injury problems
4. Very thin bench and/or unwillingness from coach to play 2nd unit players which will only exacerbate points 3. || Realistically Knicks Bucks & Grizz are the punchers chance teams || Please tell me you knocked on wood for Julius!! || You're not wrong- on both!! || We removed your comment for being low effort. If you edit it and explain your thought process more, we'll restore it. Thanks! || ""I don't think any of these teams will win it all this year, but I wouldn't be shocked to see one of them take down a top-tier contender from the Oklahoma City, Boston, Cleveland, Denver, and Los Angeles group."" || oh yeah you're right my fault || Nah they're the very definition of a puncher's chance.  And I almost agree with OP just leaving them off entirely - it's *very* thin odds given the path they're staring down.

Every single thing would have to go right for the Knicks and wrong for the Celtics to beat Boston in the 2nd round - that's just a horrible personnel matchup for the Knicks.  And then they'd still have to face the Cavs, and then the Finals.  Their first round series won't even be easy.

Knicks are down to +3000 odds to win it all - that's a puncher's chance. || That's great, but they're a better team on paper and record wise than the four teams you mentioned having a puncher's chance, so is there a totally separate category for them or something? || A lot of people are missing the point of my response. I never said the Knicks are likely to beat the Cavs or Celtics in a 7 game series. The guy listed four teams he believes to have a puncher's chance at making a finals run, all of which have worse records than the Knicks.

And give me a break with #3. Stop with that cult crap. Almost every team has some sort of injury problems come playoff time. The Knicks this season are currently #30 in games missed. They've been the healthiest team all year. Brunson landed on someone's foot. It's a contact injury, it has nothing to do with minutes played or anything like that. Just brining up this topic at all takes away a lot of credibility from any opinion you may have because it's all fantasy.

  
Edit: Surprise surprise, here come the downvotes from the minutes police cult who attach themselves to a false narrative that literally doesn't exist. || Bingo. Nobody talks about Knicks as championship contenders given their poor record against top teams but more as conference finals outs.

I’d love a Knicks Grizz finals tbh. A Ja redemption arc with a gritty NY team. First match was a landslide second was a slobberknocker. || Knocked on wood and did every possible ritual. I'm not a Wolves fan but I've always liked Randle"
Giannis Antetokounmpo,"""Giannis Antetokounmpo"" OR ""Giannis"" OR ""Greek Freak"" OR ""The Greek Freak"" OR ""Antetokounmpo"" OR ""The Freak""",2025-03-13,nbadiscussion,1jb1nw4,Glass Cannon players and building rosters,"Donovan Clingan is a modern glass cannon. He's  elite at offensive rebounding, and has defensive rim numbers that are equivalent to Wembenyama. But he's got no perimeter shot, his 290 frame struggles in space, and he's probably going to have career injury problems everyone that size has. 

A glass cannon is a guy ridiculously overpowered in certain areas, but also exceedingly vulnerable in others. In RPG games he'd be that wizard who can magic missile a mountainside, but because he's old and squishy you can one shot him right off the board.

Players in this mold are always situational and stressful.  Some nights they are the linchpin to a 30 point beatdown, and others they're virtually unplayable. 

The coach and teammates will always be on the edge, looking for signs that the good outweighs the bad. You have to have specific play styles to make him work, and you are more limited on teammates you can pare with him.

But it's not all bad. The risk is often worth the reward. Shaq, Iverson and to some extent Curry were all glass cannons stars (fucking howitzers!) Gobert is the modern poster boy for the modern highly successful glass cannon role player. Dennis Rodman may be the all time glass cannon role player. 

This type of guy can be great. But you have to be clear the juice is worth the squeeze. Nobody projects Clingan to be Shaq-tier, but Gobert is achievable. 

It's interesting to project young glass cannons based on where the league is headed. Most would say his lack of perimeter play  is a really bad omen. 

But one reason I think Clingan's worth it is the recent dominance of interior players. Jokic and Embiid have been camped at the topped on the MVP list. Ja, SGA and Giannis are going to destroy you at the rim if you don't have someone who can make them think twice. It's inevitable that Wemby will be next. 

Clingan is a specific solution to a specific problem in our league--a problem you have to solve to win at the highest levels.

The key is to build around him the right way, work on his vulnerabilities as much as you can, and for God's sakes don't hand him a Gobert contract that hamstrings your roster's flexibility. Because you'll need that flexibility to make him work. 

Is Clingan a building block for the future? Eh, he's more like the statue you put in front of the building.  You can see him plainly every night, but he's not like Deni Avdija or Toumani Camara where you know you can use him in any situation no matter what. 

I absolutely love Clingan. When he's levelling mountain sides it's so much fun to watch. But you have to be dead certain about glass cannons if you really want to consider them foundational pieces. I'm not there yet.

Glass cannon stars and glass cannon role players live in entirely different spheres. You can easily decide to mold a team around a prime Steph. But finding the right fit for Draymond Green outside of Golden State is a lot harder. (Part of Green's glass is psychological.  His bullshit would wear thin on many teams.) 

Glass cannons, I suppose, are basically the polar opposites of the jack-of-all-trades. The biggest nit you can pick about Jason Tatum is that he's not enough of a cannon. But you can plug him into any playoff team in the league and likely contend instantly. 

Portland never built a roster around the glass cannon of Dame Lillard. We paired him with a less powerful cannon in CJ and wasted most of his prime. 

In Portland, Sharp, Tou, Deni and Scoot (yes he's actually starting to look good) are our cornerstones. We're the youngest team in the league, and we need guys with flexibility to mold around the star that hopefully emerges. 

Clingan isn't a cornerstone.  I want him to be, but I just don't think he's got the skills and talent to rise above glass cannon role player.

Like, there's a palpable hate and disgust to it. Just such a negative and cynical way to view players and the game IMO. || Dunno, Clingan's shot isn't nonexistent, it can be worked on. I don't think Gobert is a good comp for him, he's not useless on offence || Shaq was absolutely not a glass cannon. He was elite or above average in every phase of the game except jump shooting. || You know the interesting, overlooked glass cannon guys. Volume scoring guards without much else. It looks so good and they're absurdly skilled, but they actually hamper team building unless you bring them off the bench. || Just wanna say I really enjoyed reading this, your writing style is very engaging || I always figured Mark Eaton and to some extent James Donaldson only existed to stop Kareem  or at least make him work harder (harder to finesse a big guy than shoot over a small guy like Duncan over LJ).

They also minimize the star's defensive impact since they're stuck keeping a non threat off the offensive boards.

I wonder why Tacko Fall couldn't establish a role as a foil for Embiid.  (I guess Embiids body foiled itself, Giannis, Wemby, AD are too quick, and Jokic too much of a playmaker to be stopped this way...leaving no one else to face except Clingan/edey) || Jokic. He orchestrates a beautiful offense while standing completely still on the other end as if he were cosplaying a traffic cone.  || Yeah no one calls a one dimensional tank a glass cannon. || Yeah. In RPGs it's cloth wearing magic users that can cast spells that do ridiculous damage but are easy to kill. An NBA equivalent would be Kyrie Irving, or Anthony Davis, I Zion Williamson, back in the day Bill Walton. Everyone knows they are great, but they easily get injured. 

Not all big men are injury prone. There is no evidence Clingan will be this. Robert Parish and Kareem were both big men and they have played more games than LeBron. 

Actually 7 of the top 10 games played for their career leaders are big men. In fact it's guards that usually have shorter careers. 

Sure some big men due to their size have lingering issues that do limit them, but we quite frankly don't know if Clingan is going to be one of those guys. So we can't really call him a ""glass cannon"" imo. || Oh yeah he was actually a great example of borderline star glass cannon. || > The warriors were able to build well around him with great defenders at the 2-5

Thats a lot because of Steph. In this day and age of 4-1 or 5 out he managed to win a championship with Looney at center and Draymond at PF. Both provided no spacing/rimpressure/scoring. 

Kerr has always relied on Curry to provide just enough offense to otherwise defensively slanted teams. 

While he's not even close to elite defensively as an individual, he is pretty good as a team defender and brings a whole lot in the macro sense if you consider it as him giving them the opportunity to build from the back without worrying too much about shooting etc. 

Jokic' teams have constantly been middle of the pack defensively (with the notable exception of drtg#8 in their title year), because they build from the front - accentuating his strenghts. Currys championship teams leveraged his strenghts to pack the roster with defense -and hustle guys. || Free throws? Ball handling? Playmaking? Perimeter Defense after year 4? || I laughed way too hard at this. || >An NBA equivalent would be Kyrie Irving, or Anthony Davis

#Pistons

The Cade Cunningham led Pistons defeated the Knicks twice at Madison Square Garden this season; twice.

That should not be the team that the Knicks want to see in the first round.

Pistons are a feisty young group that has a home crowd starving for a playoff run.

#Bucks

The Knicks have matched up very well against the Giannis-led Bucks this season (3-0 sweep).

No Dame Lillard for the foreseeable future, this would be the ideal 3/6 matchup (assuming the Hawks don’t creep up and take over the 6th spot in the East).

#Celtics

The Knicks built their team to compete with the Celtics. The Celtics have taken their matchups against the Knicks since opening night with an all business approach (3-0 BOS over NYK so far, 1 last regular season game in MSG next week).

At some point the Knicks will have to show that they can compete against the 2024 NBA champions. If they matchup against them in the semifinals then so be it.

The Cavs offensive engines are small guards which the Knicks are more equipped to stop than the Celtics wings. 

The Celtics 5 out spacing is also just impossible for KAT to deal with, either he's giving up an open 3 or layup just about every time he's involved in the action. Cavs would definitely force him into some difficulty as well, but they don't have the same level of spacing to expose him. || The Knicks are 1-7 in the Thibs era against the Celtics the last two years and this year Celtics have an average margin of victory over 20 against them.

People talk about how great Trae was in that series  because they won, so, you know, he must have played great, right? He didn't; his counting stats went up because he played more minuted, his efficiency was way worse. Yet it took multiple playoff failures for the ""Trae Young, playoff killer"" narrative to die.

The Nets lost in the first-round to the Celtics and it was seen as such a failure that it led directly to the team being broken up. Those Celtics made it to the finals and were really, really good - if that same series had happened in the conference finals, would KD have been willing to stick around? (Yes it was a sweep, but every game was competitive - games were determined by 1, 4, 6, and 7 points). Possibly. 

The financial stake for the team is also substantial. I believe every home playoff game is worth over $1m. || Cavs aren't truly battled tested yet in the playoffs.

Yeah, because...  
1. They've actually beaten the Cavs in a playoff series.  
2. The Cavs had a bad playoffs last year too.  
3. The Celtics are the defending champs and have shown they're probably better than the Cavs in a playoff series

And quite apart from anything else, it's a terrible message to be sending to your team on the eve of the playoffs- even if you're 8th seed you want your playing group believing they can beat anyone on their night - if NY did duck Boston and later encountered them in the conference finals how could they go into that matchup knowing they'd effectively already conceded they were scared of playing them? || I always loved how the last Bron led Cavs teams just totally didn’t give a fuck about seeding lol.

**Gary Payton** (in his last season in Seattle) and **Brent Barry** had VORPs of **5.9** and **5.8** respectively with **Rashard Lewis** contributing a **3.2** VORP. Everyone else on the team had a VORP **below 1.0**.

By comparison, the championship Lakers that year, which were extremely top heavy as well, had **Shaq** (**6.1**), **Kobe** (**5.2**), **Horry** (**3.0**). Top heavy, but actually slightly less so than those Sonics. They had players with VORPs above 1.0. The LeBron Heat teams which are another obvious candidate had other contributors with VORPs above 1.0 as well outside their Big 3.

By comparison, this season, only 3 players in the entire league have VORPs above 5.0 - **Jokic** (**9.1**), **Shai** (**8.6**), and **Giannis** (**6.0**). The next closest is **Tatum** at **4.6**.

I looked for teams this year with at least 2 players with a VORP at 3.2 or above and saw these 5:

* Thunder: Shai (8.6), Jalen Williams (3.2)
* Cavaliers: Jarrett Allen (3.5), Evan Mobley (3.3)
* Celtics: Jayson Tatum (4.6), Derrick White (3.3)
* Knicks: Josh Hart (3.4), Karl-Anthony Towns (3.3)
* Bucks: Giannis (6.0), Damian Lillard (3.2)

By the end of the year, the Rockets may have 2 players qualify (Amen Thompson is at 3.1 and Sengun is already at 3.8) and the Cavaliers may have 3 (Mitchell is at 3.1).

Not a single team this year has 3 players with a 3.2 VORP or better though. And every playoff team has contributions with VORPs over 1.0.

  
Does anyone remember this Sonics team? Statistically, they had a better Big 3 than the championship Lakers and the #2 contender Spurs.

the reigning champs had the problem that they took too long to transition between the inefficient duncan led offense to a efficient ginobili led offense, parker won the fmvp and wants a larger role but he is simply not good enough. duncan is out of his prime, ginobili has 2 years left, parker has not entered it yet. the team is not constructed for the necessary change, instead they stick with the old players and to stagger the parker minutes they keep bringing ginobili from the bench.

the team looks like this, only 6 regular players average at least 20min

Duncan (31) 34mpg **VORP 4.8** BPM 5.2 **TS% 54**

Parker (25) 33mpg **VORP 2.6** BPM 2.4 **TS% 54**

they finish 56-26 only 1 game behind the 1st seeded Lakers. in the playoffs they reach the WCF but fall to the Lakers 1-4. Ginobili was dealing with an injury that made him lose his speed and elevation the entire run and the old guys could not rise to the level.

this is a good example of a typical playoff-build team, and why they fail. playoff teams need a sixth man kind of player to shake things up when things like injuries happen.

this season to me that team is the warriors. they look good for the last 20 or so games but in the playoffs it is very likely that if they can advance they will start dealing with minor injuries and it doesn't look like they have that Poole type of player like the last time they won. || Was it Vlad Radmanovic with the braids or was it the year after? || I think the '76 Lakers might edge them out with Kareem posting a 9.1 and the entire team going for just 10.2 ('22 Nuggets at 12.4 total).

I am no mathematician and I do not know much about statistics, so I just decided to take some time and find the answer to the easiest question:

*What is the average rank for each All-NBA eligible player across multiple popular advanced metrics this season?*

This was more for my personal curiosity. I do not claim that this method actually has any validity or importance, but I did the work so I thought I would share.

**METHOD:**

*stats collected on 4/3*

To do this I referenced the 8 following advanced metrics that I see commonly used:

EPM, EW, LEBRON WAR(LW), RAPTOR WAR(RW), DARKO DPM(DPM), PER, WS, and VORP

I decided to include both EPM and EW because I think EPM is the best advanced metric so I wanted to give it some extra weight.

In order to compile the list of players best deserving of All-NBA recognition, I first went through each advanced metric for this season and gave each player a tally for an appearance in the top 20 in each of the stats.

I ended up with a list of 23 players who appeared in the top 20 in >3 out of the 8 stats, who are also likely to meet the 65 games played requirement. I had a few players that surprised me, but generally speaking it aligned with my preconceived idea of who was in contention for All-NBA recognition so I decided to roll with it. The only notable omission was Cade Cunningham who appeared in the top 20 in only 2 out of the 8 advanced metrics. Due to his narrative and likelihood of achieving All-NBA recognition, I included him.

Here are the 24 players:

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander

Nikola Jokic

Giannis Antetokounmpo (Likely)

Jayson Tatum

Evan Mobley

Donovan Mitchell

Tyrese Haliburton

Ivica Zubac

Stephen Curry (Likely)

Darius Garland

Derrick White

Jarret Allen

Anthony Edwards

Karl-Anthony Towns

Domantas Sabonis (Likely)

Alperen Sengun

James Harden

Jalen Williams

Josh Hart

LeBron James

Tyler Herro

Jaren Jackson Jr.

Jalen Brunson (Likely)

Cade Cunningham

In the following table, I list each player with each of their respective RANKS in each advanced metric. This is not the metric itself, it is just the RANK in which their metric lies in comparison to their peers. 14 in the table means the 14th best number in the league for that respective stat.

At the end of the table, I include two averages. The first average is their average rank across all 8 advanced metrics. The second average (AVG(IMP)) is their average rank across the 5 all around impact metrics (EPM, EW, RAPTOR WAR, LEBRON WAR, and DARKO DPM). I believe these metrics to be different in kind to the others, so I wanted to see their averages separately.

**NOTES**

\-Haliburton being so loved by advanced metrics definitely surprised me given the narrative about him earlier this season. I would be curious to see his metrics if he can put together a full season of consistent play. Advanced metrics understandably love you if you push pace, generate great looks, and rarely turn the ball over.

\-Derrick White being so beloved by advanced metrics was not necessarily surprising, but the fact that it was enough to rank top 15 in this group of players is impressive. He is the epitome of a winning player.

\-While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated. I believe he deserves a lot more love for his performance this season(DPOY anyone?).

\-LeBron, JJJ, Brunson, and Cade not ranking well is definitely not what I expected going into this. Most of the conversation around these players land them in Second Team at worst and I have even heard arguments around these players to claim the 5th First Team spot.

(Looking to see how EW calculated…) || Man Zubac is awesome, eye test tells me he's a great center -- but I still think there is some black box of these stats where they are giving what a center does more weight than other positions.

I bet it does.) || [deleted] || Yo this is great. I've idly thought about doing this but was always too lazy, so thanks for the effortpost. I expected LeBron to make 3rd team and also expected Jokic to edge out SGA so that's 2 things I got wrong there.

(At least in your AVG(IMP) rankings)
  
**Edited** to mention their extremely great health this season has a lot to do with it as they're all eligible for these honors. || I did that a while back and was really surprised how each metrics have their clear bias baked in yet top 4, r guys seem to be all unanimous. Like EPM favors offensive usage, LEBRON favors players that fit well into winning teams, DARKO really favors establish stats, etc. but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context. These metrics are really helpful to find out underrated role players, but for stars, they can be extremely misleading. || It’s crazy that the Cavs best player isn’t even one of the 4 in this analysis  || Very interesting perspective, thank you for sharing!

Zubac is a beast || Interesting stuff. Thanks for gathering this data and breaking it all down. Unfortunately, I think you're right that due to media narrative, there is no chance Brunson and LeBron get left off, and it's likely that Cade and JJJ will make it. Although those guys have all had very good seasons so it's not like it will be a travesty for any one of them to get the nod.

Zubac has almost no chance, as deserving as he is (I've been very impressed with him in the few clippers games I've watched this year) and White and Allen will likely miss the cut. I'd love to see Allen make it. The guy is such a great two way player and he's so unselfish on offense. He really makes the Cavs a much better team. || Jarrett Allen and Ivica Zubac ranking #3 and #4 in win shares is an indictment of that statistic.

> While I do not claim these stats hold significance, they do support my opinion of Zubac being largely underrated.

I agree with the first part of your statement. But given that reality, why are you then trying to use these insignificant statistics to draw conclusions?

Zubac and Allen have roles to play and they play them well, but role players don't deserve to be ranked ahead of guys like Brunson or Cunningham who have far more difficult burdens to carry. || Why would you base it off metrics nobody uses?

Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil.  They’re useless.  

Obviously this isn’t how the teams are selected.  

Harden hasn’t made an all nba team in 5 years and he’s not going to make one over LeBron, who was the February player of the month and 5th on mvp ladder. || [removed] || Ultimately, the players are very close in a lot of these metrics so one good game or bad game down the stretch could vastly change the calculus for this analysis. 

  
For example, Ant had a good game last night and EW updated so now Ant is up from #10 all the way to #5. This alone would likely push Ant firmly into second team if I were to re run the analysis. But as of 4/3, these were the rankings. || Before Kawhi started playing like Kawhi, I thought Zubac was easily the most important Clipper. And for a team that was projected to be a lottery team to have a shot at 50-wins, that's Hella impressive || PER notoriously overweighs rebounding, so bigs pretty much always have higher PER than guards of similar quality. TBH it's a very flawed advanced stat that shouldnt be included in any analysis including this one imo. || The hate towards him was crazy. The people that were saying that haven't actually watched him play in a meaningful amount. He is the best pure creator in the league, hands down. His three point shooting, while streaky at times, is upper echelon. His defense is improving significantly as he gets more experience. He has moved to being a solidly average defender, when he was often a genuine liability in the past.

He still catches hate from people who like to make similar arguments against him that people do for John Stockton. It's baffling to me that people attempt to make straight faced arguments against these players because they make a high volume of ""easy assists"". You are seriously going to hold it against a player because they are capable of coordinating an offense so effectively, that they are able to very consistently get good shooters open shots, in spots that they shoot particularly well from? That is a testament to their ability as a creator, not a detrimental attribute. || The irony about the ""one good month"" thing is that it's really one bad month that tricked people. He was All-NBA last year and will likely be again this year. He had a bad start to the year but is putting up historically efficient numbers. It's basically him and prime CP3 in terms of this combination of scoring and assist volume + efficiency. Nobody else in NBA history has done this. || It’s the same story around the current MVP debate. For a huge amount of NBA fans, box score is the only value you bring to a team. Offensive output, advanced metrics, film, team success, none of it matters compared to that box score that you can glance at for five seconds and determine how valuable a player is. || The reality is that Allen not being worthy of an all-star this year is mostly a numbers thing, getting four players in is pretty ridiculous given how much talent there is around the league. But having watched most of our games this year, I think it's debatable that he's even our fourth-best player, especially if you consider his defensive impact. He's also the type of player to be underrated by casual/occasional viewers, because he does a lot that doesn't show up on the scoreboard. || >but overall they heavily underrate good offensive players who carry bad offense, stars on bad teams, or high-usage players on low efficiency regardless of context.

Do these metrics underrate these players or are you just over rating them? 

Harden, Herro, and Cade all have good advanced stats. They all carry fairly poor offences || Yes, the biggest reason for this is that none of these stats measure on-ball defensive attention drawn and the benefits that it leads to for other players on the team at the risk of deflating counting stats of the player drawing the attention.

Making open looks as the 3rd/4th option on your team and ending up with a high TS% does not make a player better than say a Cade Cunningham or Donovan Mitchell.

It’s similar to how Ayton had distinctly better advanced numbers than Luka in their rookie seasons along with strong box score numbers at incredible efficiency yet anyone watching knew he was Ayton was a play finisher role player on a fully firing suns team and Luka was the entire Mavs offence. || 2025 is certainly the year of our Lord Tyrone Jerome. || What makes Zubac a role player? He's averaging 17 and 13 playing 33 MPG while anchoring the Clippers' defense. He's contending for the most important player on the team right next to Harden and Kawhi. || > Publicly available “advanced” stats are snake oil. They’re useless.
> 
> 

Publicly available defensive metrics, absolutely. There's basically zero value in those.

Publicly available overall metrics are solid. The vast majority of basketball value comes from offense and we can measure most of that. It's imperfect, but it's a very good way to determine who's in the ballpark. || My understanding is a lot of these stats weigh a bunch of counting stats heavier for centers than other roles -- which is OK up to a point because maybe a center getting an assist is more valuable than a PG doing the same, but it's hard to know. PER people who know seem to generally perceive as antiquated, right? || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || As someone who doesn't watch much Indiana or Charlotte basketball,  I'm really curious how Haliburton and Ball compare now. And to a lesser extent, Ant.  
Thinking back, man, that was a really fun draft class. || Exactly! And he turns the ball over at an insanely low rate, like historically low. || It's so weird, he was an all-star and top-tier playmaker an entire year on the Pacers in 22-23 season. His second half of the season in 21-22, when he was traded to the Pacers, was also really really good. His shooting averages have been good his entire career. ""One good month"" people are trolls or need to have their eyes checked because all you need to do is watch 48 minutes of the Pacers and you'll see him constantly trapped and doubled _at the logo_ and instead of playing hero ball he swings it because someone will be open, whether it counts in his box score or not.

But it's no surprise, average basketball fans are really really stupid when it comes to elite playmakers. Jokic was clowned for years and now pretty much everyone recognize how incredible he is. I wonder, what is the difference between now and years before? Ring finger, that's it. || Wouldn't models that include plus/minus stats account for this? Even if you don't necessarily generate an assist or made shot, if your ""gravity"" is actually opening things for teammates and contributing to winning it will show up in the plus/minus."
Giannis Antetokounmpo,"""Giannis Antetokounmpo"" OR ""Giannis"" OR ""Greek Freak"" OR ""The Greek Freak"" OR ""Antetokounmpo"" OR ""The Freak""",2025-04-08,nbadiscussion,1jv3noc,Watching both the NBA and soccer this season I've noticed some distinct parallels between the seasons of Mo Salah and Giannis,"Alright, this one is a bit obscure to be honest but just hear me out.

Mohamed Salah and Giannis Antetokounmpo have both had incredible seasons but you wouldn’t always know that from how the media talks about them Salah has been on fire for Liverpool with 27 goals and 17 assists in 31 games which if you don't watch football/soccer is by far the best stastical season of any player in the world currently.

That’s 44 goal contributions and yet people keep asking if he’s finished and criticise him in favour of players like Raphinha or Dembele.

No disrespect to those guys but Salah’s been doing this every season for years now and still gets overlooked in the Ballon dor talk by the media especially.

On the basketball side Giannis is averagingbover 30 points nearly 12 rebounds and 6 assists per game which puts him right up there with the best in the league and is probably his best season overall based on statistics and efficiency.

But in the MVP conversation it’s all about Jokic and Shai right now. It's s not that they don’t deserve it but Giannis is putting up historic numbers and everyone treats him like a distant 3rd place rather than a genuine mvp candidate. We've seen no one in the media push for any Giannis mvp inclusion (not saying he should win it but people acting like the gap is massive just seems unfair to me when giannis is also one of the best defenders in the league.

Another thing is that both guys have struggled due to their teams letting them down at times this season, Liverpool getting knocked out of the champions league early didn't do Salah any favours, sure he played badly but no one else turned up when Salah was being double teamed every time he touched the ball. Similarly, the bucks have struggled overall due to injuries and really no one is performing at a high level other than Giannis and Dame who is out for the season.


Both guys also get clowned for how they play
Salah is direct and clinical but some fans act like that’s boring or not beautiful football because he's not a great dribbler even though his passing has become elite. 

Giannis bulldozes his way to the rim and dominates physically but people criticize him for being a below average shooter and call him a 'run and dunk man' even though his mid range has improved massively.

Even though what they do is insanely effective and hard to stop they don’t get the same love as some of their flashier peers

It’s wild how two of the best athletes in the world can keep performing at this level and still be underrated in conversations about the best in the game. They’re victims of their own consistency. When they shine people say yeah but he always does that. When they have a quiet game suddenly everyone’s talking about decline.

Whether it’s MVP or Ballon dor they’re always in the mix but never really the favorite And honestly they deserve way more credit for carrying their teams and doing it year after year without slowing down.


",40,28,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1jv3noc/watching_both_the_nba_and_soccer_this_season_ive/,2025-04-09 07:39:21,"It’s a fun comparison but you’ve lost me pretty early on saying Salah is having an incredible season but not being given credit by the media…there’s a new Opta stat about Salah every single week. 

Before the PSG game he was being talked about endlessly. They’re going to win the league and he’s already won every player of the year award that exists in England.

Giannis is having a much quieter season in large part due to his team being bad. Both have consistently gotten their flowers but when you get knocked out of the CL in the R16 and Barcelona are breaking their own goal scoring records, it’s not hard to see why the attention shifts. Not to mention Salah’s form drops when Trent is out of the team and the last few weeks it’s not been all that easy for him.

Giannis will always be ranked in the top 3-5 players no matter who you ask. But they’re not an exciting team and don’t have a lot going for them this season. If they rally in the playoffs and make a run the noise will change, that’s the nature of the league. || I don’t think Giannis is disrespected somehow this season. The Bucks just suck. They’re old, have a notoriously meme-inspiring coach and they’ve kinda just pranced around all season with no identity on either end of the ball. They’re in the East and about to be 5th or 6th, which is as mediocre as it gets among teams in the playoffs. The IST win was nice for them, but that’s inconsequential to anything in the playoffs. 

I also don’t think there’s any recourse about Giannis being less than the third best player in the league this year, which is fair. He doesn’t get as much attention because he’s not doing better in either department than the two guys having historic seasons ahead of him in the MVP race. || That's very contrived of you. Salah is not far better than the next best players - that is simply statistically wrong. Viktor Gyökeres or Robert Lewandowski don't have numbers that are far removed from that.
As for Giannis, I can't understand why you feel that way. I obviously read other news sites and am on different threads than you. Nobody is underestimating Giannis or not giving him the credit he deserves. These are just individual trolls but that's not the general attitude of NBA fans or journalists. I don't see any commonality at all in the perception or performance of the two athletes. || OMG Liverpool fans are now invading the NBA forums. Salah has been spoken of plenty in the media before Liverpool got knocked out of the CL, he was the favorite to win the Balon Dor up until that point. And Liverpool have already secured the title so there’s nothing to talk about there. Yeah he’s having an amazing amazing season but let’s not act like he hasn’t gotten all his flowers. He’s gonna go down as one of the best PL wingers of all time. As for Giannis, he’s been awesome but unfortunately his team has a very little chance to make it out the East, 2 of the 3 most dominant teams this season are in the East. || As a United fan, I'm staying away from commenting on the football side of this ;)

As for Giannis, he IS a distant third this season. Not because what he's doing isn't astonishing, but because the other two are putting up historically unprecedented numbers all season long. Also, if you look at betting odds and mock ballots, it's now basically sewn up for SGA. In a ""normal"" season about 4-5 years ago, what Giannis has done this year would dominate the MVP conversation, but the other two have elevated their play to absurd heights. I can't be arsed to look up the exact splits right now, but I recall reading this year that the Bucks on/off numbers aren't as dramatically different as the other two as a good indicator. But that was before Lillard's blood clot. || Comparing Giannis to Mo is not correct... Giannis is someone like Kane: in form, never drops stinkers, but their team sucks. || If Salah wanted a ballon d’or maybe he should have tried doing literally anything against PSG || The Bucks have the 13th best record in the NBA, and Giannis's counting stats do not separate him from Shai and Joker at all (fewer points than Shai, fewer rebounds and assists than Joker). Shai is the best player on a team having an historic regular season. He leads the league in scoring, and is playing All-NBA defense. Joker is top three in the NBA in ppg, rpg, and apg while his team is not elite they could still to 50 wins.

Giannis is correctly locked in third place with the season he is having. It some years, his numbers (and if he was on a 50-win team) he would probably win the MVP. This is not one of those years.

Side note, I think if the Nuggets had held onto the #2 seed, that Jokic would have a shot at keeping it close. With his team falling to 4, 5 or 6 (7 and 8 are still possible for them), I highly doubt it is even close. || In all fairness, Salah was getting his flowers from the media and widely talked about as being the in form best player in the world. This hype went up until he ghosted in the 2nd leg against PSG and got knocked out of the champions league. The Champs is the biggest competition in football this year (as no WC this year) so naturally the players who perform in this tournament are going to get more praise from the media.

Raphinha and Dembele are still competing in the champs and one is likely going to win it as the best player on their team. The media is right to focus on these two at the moment. 

Liverpool have basically already won the premier league so there is no real reason to continue to discuss that competition. There is basically no reason for the media to continue to talk about Salah as there is no new narrative or Liverpool to report (other than if Salah signs a new contract or not). || This is honestly an amazing take. Two completely underrated and under the radar greats. My only argument is that raphina is currently playing out of his mind and plays for probably the most entertaining team since the Messi Barcelona years, so I see why people prefer him. 

Giannas and Salah are both so insanely direct all the time that’s a crazy comp.  || This. And Salah was invisible in the games against PSG. The Champions League is the biggest competition this season so it will just be normal that Salah will not win Ballon d’Or || I understand that the Bucks are in the East, but their record is pretty similar to the Nuggets and they might end up the higher seed. While the West has more depth, the East is very strong at the top. 

I have Jokic over Giannis, but idk if “the Bucks just suck” then Denver isn’t too great. Certainly no one holds a candle to OKC || He has comparable goal numbers to Lewandowski and Gyokeres (whos playing in Portugal not a top 5 league) and has the most assists in the top 5 leagues in europe. Both Lewandowski and Gyokeres are purely goalscorers, Salah does both. || I do not follow EPL, and I have see a ton of stuff in passing about the incredible year Salah is having. Me being aware of it makes me feel like the OP's premise is flimsy. || I agree to an extent but I think Salah is more accurate cause their styles of play are very similar in how direct they are. Not to mention I don't think team sucks can apply to kane anymore now that he's at Bayern but with spurs i agree. || This. He dropped the ball, ballon d'or is gone for him. || Oh, I’m not denouncing the Bucks in favor of the Nuggets. Each of them has their own shit to deal with. Each team has suffered extended injuries for key players and that will inevitably impact their record. 

It’s the fact that Jokic is doing crazy shit that takes away from the spotlight on Giannis. Couple that with OKC’s record and Shai’s stats and the reasons for Giannis not being talked as much are pretty evident. || They're not even 4th in their Mickey Mouse conference. || Bringing up that Gyokeres is not in a top 5 league is silly given that he also scored 6 goals in his 8 Champions league appearances. || Bullshit 
Sporting is a top 16 club in Europe. There are reasons why the top players from Portugal usually end up at top clubs. 
Gyökeres has 7 assists as well as goals in the league alone. Pure goalscorer my arse. And as far as Lewandowski's role is concerned, that's total bullshit. No striker on the planet drops back and plays with his back to goal as effectively as Lewy. He creates spaces and ties down opponents to then link up his colleagues like no other. This has been one of his premium skills for many years. But you know better and say he's a pure goalscorer. || Bayern are mediocre at best in Europe... The only reason they are at the top of Bundesliga is that the other teams are dropping points whenever Bayern are losing. || Sporting being one of the best clubs in Europe doesn't change that Portugal league is not top 5. It even strengthens the argument since it makes it easier for Sporting to score goals with such a discrepancy between them and most of the competition. || Ok well regardless of wether or not you agree with the take that they are pure goalscorers or not it doesn't change that Salah has 4 less goals and 11 more assists than gyokeres, and 2 more goals and 15 more assists than lewy in their respective leagues. Salah simply brings more to an attack than either of them even if they aren't pure goalscorers. || Thing is Bayern have all the tools to be the best team in the world, they have elite players in almost every position, world class X factor players like Kane and Musiala, they are run well and were the most profitable club in the world last season (maybe second to madrid I don't remember), they have experience in the likes of Neuer Muller and Kimmich. Honestly I don't even know why they're quite average, this might be a case where the manager is to blame here, I don't know why they chose to hire Kompany. || The league is not great, but we hear this same stuff all the time and then players like Luis Diaz go on and do great at the next level.

Gyokeres does it for Sweden, he does in the in the champions league. This talk about being unproven is just a bit of a coping mechanism. He was elite in the championship the year before, and while Sporting do play against poor competition you don’t need to look THAT hard at why he’s so widely celebrated. || You claimed Salah is far away than anyone else. Shall we talk about Kane's numbers if you don't like the other examples ? Boy you've lost your way here, realise it. || Salah has 27 goals and 17 assists in the prem, Kane has 23 goals and 7 assists in the Bundesliga which is a weaker league defensively."

# Methodology

I decided to calculate all of the efficiency myself based off of raw total stats, as basketball-reference rounds all of their per-game statistics to 1 decimal place, affecting precision. So the process was: fetch the total stats for the season in question -> calculate each player's averages by stat/GP -> filter out non-qualified players -> calculate shooting efficiency.

To qualify, a player must:

1. Play in at least 58 games for the season.
2. Have an average of at least 20 MPG for the season.
3. Have an average of at least 29.5 PPG (rounded to one decimal place) for the season.

To calculate eFG% the formula is `((PTS - FT) / 2) / FGA`

To calculate TS% the formula is `(PTS) / (2 * (FGA + (0.44 * FTA)))`

To calculate their relative versions (reFG, rTS), it is the player's stat itself minus the league's average of the same stat. Meaning a rTS% of 5 is 5 percentual points above league average TS% for the season.

To calculate their adjusted versions (eFG+, TS+), it is the player's stat itself divided by the league's average of the same stat. Meaning a TS+% of 110 is 110% of the league average TS% for the season.

Per Game data goes back to the 1951-52 season. Per 75 Possessions data goes back to the 1973-74 season.

All data belongs to Sports Reference and was fetched and used in compliance with their Terms of Use.

I expected a bunch of Jokic rows, was surprised to see more Giannis than Jokic. Haven't been appreciating him enough. Also Steph in 2016 was truly a supernova, wow || What I learned from this is that Kareem deserves to get his flowers a lot more than he’s given. What a monster of a guy. 

Giannis too, underrated. I’ve liked his finals performance as one of the best I’ve ever seen, but I didn’t know he was this great || I will forever maintain Steph's 2015-16 season is the single best offensive season in the history of the NBA, otherworldly performance || You did a great job with this, super interesting read. Two observations:

* 2015-16 Steph might very well be the best season of all time.

* 2022-23 Embiid truly was a monstrous offensive season. || My takeaway from this thread is everyone criminally underrates Giannis because he doesn’t shoot triples || I love how you can see the free throw effect when comparing efg and ts lists. Shaq is on one side, Embiid and Shai on the other lol || that Curry season is such a cheat code, 50/45/90 with 30ppg will be veryyyyyy difficult to repeat by anyone else. || Embiid’s MVP was NOT a robbery, and there’s a case to be made for him winning it the year before even if you disagree. All said and done, he deserves 1 and Jokic deserves 3 (possibly 1 more this year) but y’all casuals love to hate on Embiid coz it’s cool and everyone does it || It’s a shame Embiid got hurt last season. Heading into his knee injury, I would argue he was having the best regular season in the modern era. 

36/12/6 in 34mpg on 65%TS, and that’s not even considering the defense

Watching that season, it’s crazy to not see it on here due to games played. What a shame || Why is Dames 2022 season not on this list? Meets all of your criteria and certainly should be

32.2 points per game, 64.5% TS% || Expected Curry at the top, was not suprised.

I'd argue that Steph's game is ALL about efficiency. He is the greatest shooter of all time. The value of the 3pt shot as well as free throws in terms of efficiency is just so much higher than almost anything else (except a dunk probably).

I'd argue that Harden was probably the first player to really focus on those 3 things - 3pt shot, attacking the rim and either get fouled for FTs or make an easy bucket. The issue was that he is a good shooter, not an all-time great one like Steph.

And Steph does all of those things just better and with offball movement.

I am actually surprised that Giannis is on here as often. Yes, most of his game over his career has basically been dunks or layups, but I actually expected his bad FT% + the amount of FT he takes on average to really lower his overall efficiency. His 3pt shooting volume is so low that it wouldn't impact his efficiency too much. || Where does Kobe rank? just curious. I’m assuming he barely missed the top 10. Especially during some of his high scoring years. 

I would guess seasons like 2002-03, 2006-07 and 2008-09 must all be pretty close in the rankings. || My only knock would be using points rather than usage%.  Slower eras won’t be represented as much.  Or is that taken into account somehow?

Thank you the great post! || Now take into account 3 pointers taken, FTs taken, 2s taken, era (defensive rules and spacing make it more difficult for certain guys, like Kobe and AI), and make sure you to stick per 75, since that's more fair.


Great job, imma save this post for myself || JorPoker no where near the top but people insist on calling him the greatest scorer ever because of “scoring tittle” when in fact he was nothing more than a chucker. For those who don’t know he took an average of 300 more shots per season that the guy that came #2 in his scoring tittle seasons. Shot chucking at it’s finest. || Genuinely curious, is there a player who satisfied the 1 and 3 requirement (GP and PPG) and not requirement 2 (MPG)? || He might really be in the 🐐 convo with Mike if 2016 Bron didn’t happen… imagine if Steph had that regular season and a finals MVP in the midst of a 4peat? || Why did you filter by minutes. Was there anyone averaging 30 who played fewer than 20 mpg? If so, that'd be an impressive feat of efficiency on its own || Another metric that showcases how historic Jokic' current season is, and how overrated Shai is.

Also very impressive how superb Giannis is... And with ALL NBA defense. How incredibly underrated. A shame he will likely be chained to just one championship. || Wilt doesn't look nearly as impressive as his seasons really are due to your framing. He was setting the all-time FG% marks while simultaneously shattering the all-time scoring records. Only 2-7 players were reaching the 50% mark in a season then and yet he was doing so while also taking 15-20 more shots and breaking records. They are far more impressive than anything else you've shown here. || With one more game to go, is there any way for Jokic to overtake Curry at the number 1 in efg%? || Curry ‘15-‘ 16 
PPG 30.1   Attempts 20.2

Harden ‘17-‘18 
PPG - 30.4   Attempts 20.1 || fun analysis! really enjoyed reading - the piece that this is missing from this story is the system/team these players were on.

Curry is obviously one of the most efficient scorers of all time but the system created for him enabled it. Same way the systems built around Kobe, AI, and Beal causing them to take more difficult shots due to limited options or a bad team where the defense was anchored on them because of the other players being low threats. Why not look at Offensive Ratings/efficiencies relative to their team/league

also for relative FG% - this could be further analyzed by comparing to the average FG% for the players position of players with a minimum number of FGAs per game to control for these players having to take more difficult shots then say a corner 3 guy or a SG compared to a Center's FG.

lastly the 29.5 PPG is a really limiting criteria - this list would look completely different if controlled differently - the 29.5 PPG basically makes your 20 MPG & 58 games played useless. not many players will fit the criteria of 29.5 PPG outside of those other criteria. || The comments saying “best season of all time”, “best offensive season of all time” when literally the only thing this data reflects in efficiency of players who hit 30+ and nothing else is absolutely wild lol. || Steph's 15-16 to me is not just the undisputed greatest offensive regular season of all-time, but just straight up the best regular season of all-time, period. But yeah, Steph having two seasons in this top 10 as a 6'1"" shooting PG is bonkers || Something tells me that he could’ve had multiple seasons like that one, but refuses to because it’s not really meaningful basketball if the team isn’t really getting the most out of it.

For example, he could’ve pushed to break the 3pointer record vs the Grizzlies, but opted not to because opting to do the little things that made the team win held more importance to him || Could make an argument that Curry should have won mvp in 21, especially now that some are coming out of the woodwork to disqualify team wins/seed as a point to elevate Jokic over SGA this season. Exactly the argument used against Curry that season. || Thank you for the engagement and appreciation! :)

Giannis is definitely one of the most underrated players of all-time, specially offensively.

Honestly my biggest surprise is KD showing up the same amount of times as Isaiah Thomas, but he ""only"" has 2 qualifying seasons || I think the number of “3 qtr” games Steph had limited the number of times he’s on the list.  

Same with the limited number of times KD and Jokic have had 29.5ppg seasons."
Giannis Antetokounmpo,"""Giannis Antetokounmpo"" OR ""Giannis"" OR ""Greek Freak"" OR ""The Greek Freak"" OR ""Antetokounmpo"" OR ""The Freak""",2025-04-11,nbadiscussion,1jx81kb,The most efficient 30 PPG seasons in NBA history,"Inspired by [Hardwood Paroxysm's tweet](https://x.com/HPbasketball/status/1910709892169818573), I decided to do a slightly more in-depth analysis on the most efficient 30 PPG seasons in NBA history.

# Methodology

I decided to calculate all of the efficiency myself based off of raw total stats, as basketball-reference rounds all of their per-game statistics to 1 decimal place, affecting precision. So the process was: fetch the total stats for the season in question -> calculate each player's averages by stat/GP -> filter out non-qualified players -> calculate shooting efficiency.

To qualify, a player must:

1. Play in at least 58 games for the season.
2. Have an average of at least 20 MPG for the season.
3. Have an average of at least 29.5 PPG (rounded to one decimal place) for the season.

To calculate eFG% the formula is `((PTS - FT) / 2) / FGA`

To calculate TS% the formula is `(PTS) / (2 * (FGA + (0.44 * FTA)))`

To calculate their relative versions (reFG, rTS), it is the player's stat itself minus the league's average of the same stat. Meaning a rTS% of 5 is 5 percentual points above league average TS% for the season.

To calculate their adjusted versions (eFG+, TS+), it is the player's stat itself divided by the league's average of the same stat. Meaning a TS+% of 110 is 110% of the league average TS% for the season.

Per Game data goes back to the 1951-52 season. Per 75 Possessions data goes back to the 1973-74 season.

All data belongs to Sports Reference and was fetched and used in compliance with their Terms of Use.

I expected a bunch of Jokic rows, was surprised to see more Giannis than Jokic. Haven't been appreciating him enough. Also Steph in 2016 was truly a supernova, wow || What I learned from this is that Kareem deserves to get his flowers a lot more than he’s given. What a monster of a guy. 

Giannis too, underrated. I’ve liked his finals performance as one of the best I’ve ever seen, but I didn’t know he was this great || I will forever maintain Steph's 2015-16 season is the single best offensive season in the history of the NBA, otherworldly performance || You did a great job with this, super interesting read. Two observations:

* 2015-16 Steph might very well be the best season of all time.

* 2022-23 Embiid truly was a monstrous offensive season. || My takeaway from this thread is everyone criminally underrates Giannis because he doesn’t shoot triples || I love how you can see the free throw effect when comparing efg and ts lists. Shaq is on one side, Embiid and Shai on the other lol || that Curry season is such a cheat code, 50/45/90 with 30ppg will be veryyyyyy difficult to repeat by anyone else. || Embiid’s MVP was NOT a robbery, and there’s a case to be made for him winning it the year before even if you disagree. All said and done, he deserves 1 and Jokic deserves 3 (possibly 1 more this year) but y’all casuals love to hate on Embiid coz it’s cool and everyone does it || It’s a shame Embiid got hurt last season. Heading into his knee injury, I would argue he was having the best regular season in the modern era. 

36/12/6 in 34mpg on 65%TS, and that’s not even considering the defense

Watching that season, it’s crazy to not see it on here due to games played. What a shame || Why is Dames 2022 season not on this list? Meets all of your criteria and certainly should be

32.2 points per game, 64.5% TS% || Expected Curry at the top, was not suprised.

I'd argue that Steph's game is ALL about efficiency. He is the greatest shooter of all time. The value of the 3pt shot as well as free throws in terms of efficiency is just so much higher than almost anything else (except a dunk probably).

I'd argue that Harden was probably the first player to really focus on those 3 things - 3pt shot, attacking the rim and either get fouled for FTs or make an easy bucket. The issue was that he is a good shooter, not an all-time great one like Steph.

And Steph does all of those things just better and with offball movement.

I am actually surprised that Giannis is on here as often. Yes, most of his game over his career has basically been dunks or layups, but I actually expected his bad FT% + the amount of FT he takes on average to really lower his overall efficiency. His 3pt shooting volume is so low that it wouldn't impact his efficiency too much. || Where does Kobe rank? just curious. I’m assuming he barely missed the top 10. Especially during some of his high scoring years. 

I would guess seasons like 2002-03, 2006-07 and 2008-09 must all be pretty close in the rankings. || My only knock would be using points rather than usage%.  Slower eras won’t be represented as much.  Or is that taken into account somehow?

Thank you the great post! || Now take into account 3 pointers taken, FTs taken, 2s taken, era (defensive rules and spacing make it more difficult for certain guys, like Kobe and AI), and make sure you to stick per 75, since that's more fair.


Great job, imma save this post for myself || JorPoker no where near the top but people insist on calling him the greatest scorer ever because of “scoring tittle” when in fact he was nothing more than a chucker. For those who don’t know he took an average of 300 more shots per season that the guy that came #2 in his scoring tittle seasons. Shot chucking at it’s finest. || Genuinely curious, is there a player who satisfied the 1 and 3 requirement (GP and PPG) and not requirement 2 (MPG)? || He might really be in the 🐐 convo with Mike if 2016 Bron didn’t happen… imagine if Steph had that regular season and a finals MVP in the midst of a 4peat? || Why did you filter by minutes. Was there anyone averaging 30 who played fewer than 20 mpg? If so, that'd be an impressive feat of efficiency on its own || Another metric that showcases how historic Jokic' current season is, and how overrated Shai is.

Also very impressive how superb Giannis is... And with ALL NBA defense. How incredibly underrated. A shame he will likely be chained to just one championship. || Wilt doesn't look nearly as impressive as his seasons really are due to your framing. He was setting the all-time FG% marks while simultaneously shattering the all-time scoring records. Only 2-7 players were reaching the 50% mark in a season then and yet he was doing so while also taking 15-20 more shots and breaking records. They are far more impressive than anything else you've shown here. || With one more game to go, is there any way for Jokic to overtake Curry at the number 1 in efg%? || Curry ‘15-‘ 16 
PPG 30.1   Attempts 20.2

Harden ‘17-‘18 
PPG - 30.4   Attempts 20.1 || fun analysis! really enjoyed reading - the piece that this is missing from this story is the system/team these players were on.

Curry is obviously one of the most efficient scorers of all time but the system created for him enabled it. Same way the systems built around Kobe, AI, and Beal causing them to take more difficult shots due to limited options or a bad team where the defense was anchored on them because of the other players being low threats. Why not look at Offensive Ratings/efficiencies relative to their team/league

also for relative FG% - this could be further analyzed by comparing to the average FG% for the players position of players with a minimum number of FGAs per game to control for these players having to take more difficult shots then say a corner 3 guy or a SG compared to a Center's FG.

lastly the 29.5 PPG is a really limiting criteria - this list would look completely different if controlled differently - the 29.5 PPG basically makes your 20 MPG & 58 games played useless. not many players will fit the criteria of 29.5 PPG outside of those other criteria. || The comments saying “best season of all time”, “best offensive season of all time” when literally the only thing this data reflects in efficiency of players who hit 30+ and nothing else is absolutely wild lol. || Steph's 15-16 to me is not just the undisputed greatest offensive regular season of all-time, but just straight up the best regular season of all-time, period. But yeah, Steph having two seasons in this top 10 as a 6'1"" shooting PG is bonkers || Something tells me that he could’ve had multiple seasons like that one, but refuses to because it’s not really meaningful basketball if the team isn’t really getting the most out of it.

For example, he could’ve pushed to break the 3pointer record vs the Grizzlies, but opted not to because opting to do the little things that made the team win held more importance to him || Could make an argument that Curry should have won mvp in 21, especially now that some are coming out of the woodwork to disqualify team wins/seed as a point to elevate Jokic over SGA this season. Exactly the argument used against Curry that season. || Thank you for the engagement and appreciation! :)

Giannis is definitely one of the most underrated players of all-time, specially offensively.

Honestly my biggest surprise is KD showing up the same amount of times as Isaiah Thomas, but he ""only"" has 2 qualifying seasons || I think the number of “3 qtr” games Steph had limited the number of times he’s on the list.  

Same with the limited number of times KD and Jokic have had 29.5ppg seasons."
