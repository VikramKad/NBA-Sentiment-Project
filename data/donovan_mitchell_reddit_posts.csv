Huge performance from Spida. 26 points in the second half in Cleveland's 49th win of the season

[Box Score](https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/401705418)","Man Idk where he ranks and all that shit...but something about Mitchell always felt trustworthy regardless of match up. That physicality and bounce always gets him good looks and he's never scared.

Two of those teams had the best league record in the RS so far. He needs more respect. || who needs triple double merchants when i got my meat merchant right here || He's a top 2 shooting guard and he ain't number 2 || Remember people were saying he was a fraud earlier this season lol
Players have shootings droughts but no one can deny Mitchell has a clutch gene. || bro, i swear i hate this guy. i‚Äôve never watched him play against the celtics without rattling off 15 points in a row || Been watching Mitchell since day 1. The guy just wins. 

Of current players in the league, he's got the 4th best winning percentage in the league of guys who matter.

It goes Kawhi, Tatum, Draymond and Mitchell.

And the best player Mitchell has ever played with is either Gobert in one of the Utah years, or maybe Garland or Mobley this year.

Eventually people will notice.

King of the mighty, ruler of the vast, protector of the highlands, overseer of the lowlands, keeper of the fields, lord of the rivers, master of the seas, governor of the mountains, sovereign of the valleys, high king over beasts, birds, fish, and all creeping things that crawl upon the earth. I am the one whose power stretches from the rising of the sun to its setting, the father of empires, the builder of great cities, the planter of verdant lands, the one who commands both stone and sand. I am Darius, the chosen of Ahura Mazda, the one blessed by the heavens, he who was destined before birth, marked by fate to lead, anointed by the stars themselves. King of cities gleaming with gold, King of towns carved from rock, King of the whispering forests and the silent deserts, the thunderer of battles, the gentle rain of peace. None oppose me, for my hand is iron, and my heart is unyielding. My enemies tremble at my name, for I am Darius, whose words are law, whose gaze is fire, whose voice echoes through the ages. I am the lion in the land of men, the eagle on the mountain's peak, the serpent in the river's depths, the stallion across the plains. I am Darius, the King of Kings, the pillar of civilization, the axis of all existence, the one whose wisdom is unmatched, whose courage is unquestioned, who speaks, and it is done. I rule over all that the eye can see, all that the mind can imagine, from the mountains of the east to the waters of the west, from the icy peaks to the burning deserts. All men, great and small, owe their loyalty to me, the unshakeable, the immovable, the eternal King of Kings. I am Darius, and this world is mine. || SPIDA is just. || IM TWO DAYS INTO COLLEGE üó£Ô∏èüéôÔ∏è || DARIUS ALL-STARLAND || McCain looking like the steal of the draft || ggs, was a fun one || Spida was NOT losing that game",2024-11-13

He nearly turned the ball over, but then just drilled the middy for game. || bucks are cooked and cavs this year are serious. dame and giannis combining for 70+ and still losing is crazy work || Wow, first heart attack win of the season. The march to 82-0 continues || Genuinely cannot believe Mitchell made that || Dame goes bananas 

Giannis 34/16/9

Trent plays Mitchell near perfectly on last possession

Still lose 

That is TOUGH || I wasn't able to watch the game but Bucks shouldn't lose a game where Dame and Giannis scored 41/34. What's even the winning scenario for them then? || Cue the RJ playoff clip || DONOHIM || Dame has a bad game -> Bucks lose.
Dame has a good game -> Bucks lose. || Lets Go. Imagine doing it again next game. Okoro is the reason Cavs managed to turn this around. Dude grabbed 2 huge offensive rebounds in the 4th and was able to play some proper defense. Amazing game ending shot by Mitchell on a wild play. || Bucks had a 16-point lead, Dame and Giannis combined for 75 points, AND they have a rest advantage against a Cavs team who are on the second night of a back to back yet they still lose LMAO.

Not only that, but Dame tied the 3rd most amount of 3s he‚Äôs made in a game in his career this game with 10 || Doc Rivers might cost Kamala Wisconsin || Cavs are going 82-0 confirmed. || We look so good, we fought all the way back and hustled like we really wanted that one down the stretch. What a game || These Cavs are great!! :) || Can‚Äôt help but love the Cavs man such a fun team || Most impressive win for the Cavs. Good Dame and Giannis games, back-to-back, on the road, desperate Bucks team, down 16 in first quarter. Kenny is a godsend. || Gary Trent Jr tonight: 3 points, 1-10 shooting, 1-7 from 3, 1 rebound, 1 assist, was the primary defender on the game winning shot, what does he do? || Basketball",2024-11-02
