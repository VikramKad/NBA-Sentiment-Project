2025-02-28,Donovan Mitchell leads the Cavaliers in a 22 point comeback against Boston: 41 PTS 3 REBS 5 ASTS 1 STL on 13-26 FG 5-13 3PT 10-11 FT,"After going down 22 early and trailing for the entire game, the Cavs cut the lead to 3 at the end of the third and took the lead a few minutes into the fourth. 

Huge performance from Spida. 26 points in the second half in Cleveland's 49th win of the season

[Box Score](https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/401705418)","Man Idk where he ranks and all that shit...but something about Mitchell always felt trustworthy regardless of match up. That physicality and bounce always gets him good looks and he's never scared.

He's got the most to gain of any player this upcoming playoffs...if he takes these boys all the way we're goin to start a dialogue. || After the bubble I’ll never doubt Spida, dude is a menace || Clutch time demon jesus || Donovan ""the meat"" Mitchell playing like a first team player || He could make a case for 1st team all NBA || [removed] || Dude’s shot making is insane || The earlier a team gains a 20 point lead in today’s NBA, the less real it is || CAVALANCHE IN BEANTOWN || Tatum was dominating but when it got down to the clutch Mitchell was better in every way  || Donovan “Player A” Mitchell || All he's done since getting into the league is win-win-win and be the leading scorer on like 50 win teams. Two of those teams had the best league record in the RS so far. He needs more respect. || who needs triple double merchants when i got my meat merchant right here || He's a top 2 shooting guard and he ain't number 2 || Remember people were saying he was a fraud earlier this season lol
Players have shootings droughts but no one can deny Mitchell has a clutch gene. || bro, i swear i hate this guy. i’ve never watched him play against the celtics without rattling off 15 points in a row || Been watching Mitchell since day 1. The guy just wins. 

Of current players in the league, he's got the 4th best winning percentage in the league of guys who matter.

It goes Kawhi, Tatum, Draymond and Mitchell.

And the best player Mitchell has ever played with is either Gobert in one of the Utah years, or maybe Garland or Mobley this year.

Eventually people will notice.

Anyway, this has been my Mitchell powerpoint. || FIRST TEAM ALL NBA || Let’s fucking go || Tatum saying GTFOH in the first quarter makes this so funny.",2025-02-28

""just one game,"" opposing team's fans say. to which the cavs whispher: ""no."" || Respect to McCain || I love Darius Garland

  
Jared McCain went nutty tho lmao || Mitchell with a great closing sequence.

2 cold blooded 3s || 13 wins in 22 nights. Haven't had more than 1 night off, played in 8 different cities, already had 3 B2B. It wasn't pretty tonight, but still impressive. || JARED MCCAIN IS NICE. Felt like every shot was going to go in || The guys need rest. Cavs are the team with the most games played this season. Still they are are doing amazing things out there. || McCain is a fucking bucket || So Garland is a lock as an all star right? || UH OH THE WWWWWWWWWWWWWAVALIERS ARE PLAYING PLAYOFF BASKETBALL || Just gonna put my record blinders on and say that was fun || The one thing missing from Garland's game this year has been getting hit in the face. Nice of the Sixers to get him twice on one drive to the hoop. || CAVS ARE INEVITABLE || I am Darius, the Great King, King of Kings, King of countries containing all kinds of men, King of all lands far and wide, son of Hystaspes, an Achaemenid, a Persian, son of a Persian, an Aryan, of Aryan lineage. King of the mighty, ruler of the vast, protector of the highlands, overseer of the lowlands, keeper of the fields, lord of the rivers, master of the seas, governor of the mountains, sovereign of the valleys, high king over beasts, birds, fish, and all creeping things that crawl upon the earth. I am the one whose power stretches from the rising of the sun to its setting, the father of empires, the builder of great cities, the planter of verdant lands, the one who commands both stone and sand. I am Darius, the chosen of Ahura Mazda, the one blessed by the heavens, he who was destined before birth, marked by fate to lead, anointed by the stars themselves. King of cities gleaming with gold, King of towns carved from rock, King of the whispering forests and the silent deserts, the thunderer of battles, the gentle rain of peace. None oppose me, for my hand is iron, and my heart is unyielding. My enemies tremble at my name, for I am Darius, whose words are law, whose gaze is fire, whose voice echoes through the ages. I am the lion in the land of men, the eagle on the mountain's peak, the serpent in the river's depths, the stallion across the plains. I am Darius, the King of Kings, the pillar of civilization, the axis of all existence, the one whose wisdom is unmatched, whose courage is unquestioned, who speaks, and it is done. I rule over all that the eye can see, all that the mind can imagine, from the mountains of the east to the waters of the west, from the icy peaks to the burning deserts. All men, great and small, owe their loyalty to me, the unshakeable, the immovable, the eternal King of Kings. I am Darius, and this world is mine. || SPIDA is just. || IM TWO DAYS INTO COLLEGE 🗣️🎙️ || DARIUS ALL-STARLAND || McCain looking like the steal of the draft || ggs, was a fun one || Spida was NOT losing that game",2024-11-13

I don’t want to get off. || Ty jerome legacy season apparently || Ty Jerome has to be the best backup pg in the league. || I know it’s hard to see where, but I definitely see this team losing a game or two this year. || Half way to the Warriors 24-0 || https://i.imgur.com/HG5FKox.jpeg || Only caught the last quarter but The Bulls made them work for this one down the stretch. Cavs are just too good and too versatile on both ends of the floor. || Thats just elite coaching by Kenny. The lane was clogged the whole first half so he took mobley and Allen both out which almost never happens. Cavs immediately go on a run just driving and kicking with 5 shooters on the floor. Mix in some zone defense with active hands and that’s another dub

Ty Jerome is elite || They’re going 82-0 aren’t they? || Tied for 6th best start ever. None of the 5 teams above them failed to reach the conference finals. 4 of them reached the Finals. || Ty Jerome is inevitable || Letting Vuc get switched onto Garland with no help during a game deciding possession is strategical malpractice || ty jerome we dont deserve you || Ty Jerome continues to get the most disrespectful steals every game || That was a big fuckin win || UH OH THE WWWWWWWWWWWWAVALIERS ARE PLAYING PLAYOFF BASKETBALL",2024-11-11

Honestly, it's a question of whether or not the Celtics can even keep up at this point in the east.

He nearly turned the ball over, but then just drilled the middy for game. || bucks are cooked and cavs this year are serious. dame and giannis combining for 70+ and still losing is crazy work || Wow, first heart attack win of the season. The march to 82-0 continues || Genuinely cannot believe Mitchell made that || Dame goes bananas 

Giannis 34/16/9

Trent plays Mitchell near perfectly on last possession

Still lose 

That is TOUGH || I wasn't able to watch the game but Bucks shouldn't lose a game where Dame and Giannis scored 41/34. What's even the winning scenario for them then? || Cue the RJ playoff clip || DONOHIM || Dame has a bad game -> Bucks lose.
Dame has a good game -> Bucks lose. || Lets Go. Imagine doing it again next game. Okoro is the reason Cavs managed to turn this around. Dude grabbed 2 huge offensive rebounds in the 4th and was able to play some proper defense. Amazing game ending shot by Mitchell on a wild play. || Bucks had a 16-point lead, Dame and Giannis combined for 75 points, AND they have a rest advantage against a Cavs team who are on the second night of a back to back yet they still lose LMAO.

Not only that, but Dame tied the 3rd most amount of 3s he’s made in a game in his career this game with 10 || Doc Rivers might cost Kamala Wisconsin || Cavs are going 82-0 confirmed. || We look so good, we fought all the way back and hustled like we really wanted that one down the stretch. What a game || These Cavs are great!! :) || Can’t help but love the Cavs man such a fun team || Most impressive win for the Cavs. Good Dame and Giannis games, back-to-back, on the road, desperate Bucks team, down 16 in first quarter. Kenny is a godsend. || Gary Trent Jr tonight: 3 points, 1-10 shooting, 1-7 from 3, 1 rebound, 1 assist, was the primary defender on the game winning shot, what does he do? || Basketball",2024-11-02
